{"Queensland officially drought-free for first time since 2013 [2024-05-14T15:00:24Z]": "Queensland has been declared completely free of drought for the first time in 11 years. Months of flooding rains have transformed much of the state\u2019s dusty red-earth interior into a network of swollen creeks and rivers awash with green shoots and birdlife. Diamantina and Bulloo shires, located more than 1000km west of Brisbane in Queensland\u2019s channel country, this month became the last two local government areas to have their drought declarations officially revoked. They had been in drought since 2013.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Droughts are \u201cburnt into the psyche\u201d of Jo Sheppard, the chief executive of the Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation, experiencing many as she grew up on a cattle station in the neighbouring Paroo shire. \u201cA 10-year drought is incredibly difficult to endure \u2026 it takes its toll psychologically, it\u2019s that uncertainty, you have no idea when a drought will end,\u201d Sheppard said.   Related: Rain brings green shoots to Queensland, but not enough to avoid drought     The state\u2019s drought-free status is cause for celebration, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare occurrence and certainly welcome.\u201d Notwithstanding the state-wide declaration, there are still large pockets of land untouched by significant rainfall. According to the department of agriculture and fisheries, 35 properties across Queensland still hold \u201cindividual droughted property\u201d status. Pat Gibson grazes cattle in the Diamantina shire. Rainfall in January was welcome relief to some of the worst conditions he\u2019d ever seen, but he remains cautious about the years ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s always teetering on the borderline of drought out here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s central Australia, you\u2019re on the edge of the Simpson desert, you know it\u2019s going to be around the corner.\u201d In 2015, drought declarations peaked when 88% of Queensland was identified as in drought. The chair of the Agforce sustainability committee and central Queensland grazier, Mark Collins, said extensive rainfall across much of the state has given many producers \u201cbreathing space\u201d to \u201cenjoy the moment\u201d. Global heating has exacerbated recent droughts in Australia, and is predicted to increase their length and intensity in the future. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep adapting as best we can, farmers are innovative,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe cycle of drought and flood is one we are accustomed to.\u201d The federal government last week pledged $519m over eight years to fund the next stage of the Future Drought Fund, with a greater emphasis on global heating adaptation. The Productivity Commission last year found the fund, introduced by the previous Coalition government in 2019, underspent its annual budget and should focus more on programs with \u201clasting public benefit\u201d. Sheppard said farmers are becoming increasingly prepared for drought. \u201cI saw that within my own family in my lifetime \u2026 we certainly become a lot more strategic, rather than just hoping that the drought breaks,\u201d she said. Wangkamahdla woman, Avelina Tarrago, said the rains have had a \u201cspectacular\u201d impact on the landscape.   Related: Doubt and flooding rains: how an unusual El Ni\u00f1o has affected Australian farmers    \u201cThe land has been needing that nourishment for a long time,\u201d Tarrago said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful going out on country after those rains, the bush flowers and foods that come out, it\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d A fifth-generation grazier in Queensland\u2019s channel country, Stephen Tully, said drought is analogous to the landscape. \u201cIt can be this slow cancer that creeps across everything in the landscape, you notice it in the animals, the birds, everything starts to disappear.\u201d \u201cBut when it does rain, the country celebrates, it\u2019s boom and bust, it\u2019s always been like that,\u201d Tully said. Karen Monaghan, a Wangkangurru Yarluyandi traditional owner from Queensland\u2019s channel country, said drought affects \u201cevery crevice\u201d of outback life. Lately she\u2019s been spending her mornings by the Thompson River in central Queensland. \u201cUsually it\u2019s a dusty creek bed,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cNow the lilies are up and the birds are going crazy trying to catch small fish.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful sight.

Swiss mining company Glencore was awaiting the Queensland government\u2019s approval of a pilot scheme to inject 330,000 tonnes of liquified CO2 into an aquifer about 2.3km underground in southern Queensland. But in its assessment of the proposal\u2019s environmental impact statement, the state department of environment found the project could not proceed due to potential \u201cirreversible or long-term change to groundwater quality\u201d. The Great Artesian Basin is one of the biggest underground water sources in the world.   Related: Gina Rinehart, One Nation and the Greens all oppose Glencore\u2019s plan to store CO2 in the Great Artesian Basin \u2013 why? | Temperature Check    A spokesperson from the Queensland department of environment said the aquifer where Glencore proposed to store the Co2 was \u201cnot confined\u201d, meaning that once injected, it could migrate to other aquifers and cause an increase in concentrations of contaminants including lead and arsenic.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cThe departments final decision \u2026 makes it clear that other carbon capture and storage projects will not be viable in the Great Artesian Basin,\u201d the spokesperson said. Opposition to the Glencore proposal brought together an unusual alliance of environmental and farming groups \u2013 including Gina Rinehart\u2019s agriculture business, One Nation and the Greens. The Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation chief executive, Jo Sheppard, said legislation must now be put in place to permanently protect the basin from future proposals. \u201cWe know that there are currently two companies with exploration permits for CCS in the [Great Artesian Basin] and we know that other companies globally are looking at the GAB as a cheap way to conduct CCS at an industrial scale to manage their emissions,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThe Queensland government can and must now take a leadership role and put regulations in place to protect the Queensland component of the GAB from further CCS bids,\u201d she said. In March, Queensland\u2019s other peak farming body, AgForce, launched a legal challenge against the proposal, seeking a judicial review of a 2022 decision that found the project did not need to be assessed under federal environmental laws.   Related: Queensland farming lobby launches legal challenge against Great Artesian Basin carbon capture trial    The AgForce chief executive, Michael Guerin said the project was \u201cclearly a trial for future upscaling in this aquifer in the GAB, which Glencore believed had a storage capacity of up to 730 billion litres of industrial waste\u201d. \u201cWhile we celebrate this state government decision, our thoughts now immediately go to how to best protect the GAB into the future from such environmental threats,\u201d he said. The project would have seen liquefied C02 captured from the Millmerran coal power station trucked to an injection site outside Moonie, 260km west of Brisbane and within the electorate of Nationals leader David Littleproud. Littleproud said the Nationals support CCS as a method to offset the emissions from coal and gas but \u201conly in the appropriate place and once there is confidence in the science\u201d. \u201cThe Great Artesian Basin is an important water source for farmers and communities in Queensland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative we protect it and that proper, thorough assessments are undertaken for any sequestration project.\u201d A Glencore spokesperson said the decision is a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d and \u201ccomes after a damaging misinformation campaign and political opportunism by multiple players\u201d. \u201cIf CCS is not available as an abatement option for industry it will have far-reaching ramifications,\u201d they said. There is currently one other CCS project under construction in Australia and a further 16 projects proposed. The only operating CCS project in the country \u2013 and the largest industrial CCS system in the world \u2013 is at Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas development, offshore in Western Australia. Despite this, figures released by Chevron last year showed emissions from the project had increased by more than 50%.

However, he added that snowfall in Queensland was \u201calways marginal\u201d and challenging to predict. \nRegano said \u201cdiehard\u201d weather watchers would likely be headed for the rural locality of Eukey, altitude 966 metres. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably find some meteorologists hiding out there tonight,\u201d he said. \nAnother prime viewing spot was The Summit, at 923 metres elevation, but an employee at the local general store was less convinced. \u201cIt\u2019s not concrete, it\u2019s just rumours, so my guess is no \u2013 they always talk about it but it never happens,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \nRegano said any snow that is recorded is likely to be in the form of snow flurries, which have recently fallen across parts of New South Wales, rather than powder that sits on the ground. \nSnow flurries were last recorded in Queensland in 2019, but it had been nine years since snowmen stood on the Granite Belt after up to 8cm of snow blanketed Stanthorpe, the region\u2019s largest town, in 2015. \nThe Stanthorpe shop owner Debbie-Ann Wilmot said the possibility of snow had brought a few visitors from Brisbane to the town. \u201cInstead of \u2018how\u2019s it going?\u2019, it\u2019s been \u2018where\u2019s the best place to see snow?\u2019\u201d she said. \n\u201cWe hear this every year to no avail \u2026 but I\u2019m optimistic this time.\u201d \nOn a property outside town, Maria Caterer has been waking at 2am each morning to catch a glimpse of any snowfalls. She recounted the \u201creally odd\u201d sight of the snow in 2015. \u201cI\u2019d never seen snow before, it was quite exciting. The cows didn\u2019t know what to make of it, the dogs too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s looking unlikely this year, but we are forever hopeful.\u201d \n \n  Related: Snowfall possible in northern NSW as low pressure brings Antarctic blast to southern Australia  \n \nA rare weather event in Antarctica was adding to that hope. The Weatherzone meteorologist James Rout said the Antarctic conditions could cause heightened winter weather on the east coast of Australia in the next four to six weeks. \nRout said a stratospheric warming event was forming over the south pole, with sudden warming set to raise high-altitude temperatures by tens of degrees in a few days. That warm stratospheric air, 30-40km above the Earth\u2019s surface, can cause cooler air lower in the atmosphere to move north. \nAlthough too early to confirm, the event may result in a cold front and strong winds over southern Australia and increased rainfall and snowfall in both the south-west and south-east of the country in mid-August. \nBut in the longer term, Regano said, the chance of snow in Queensland was shrinking due to human-induced global heating. \u201cEventually these snow events will be a fond memory of the past,\u201d Regano said. \n \n Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter \n Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community \n", "300,000ha Queensland cattle station bought for conservation after $21m donation [2024-04-16T23:00:03Z]": "A Queensland outback cattle station the size of Yosemite national park which includes key habitat for the elusive night parrot has been acquired for conservation after an anonymous donation of $21m. Vergemont station, 110km west of Longreach, was acquired in a joint purchase by the Queensland government and the Nature Conservancy, which brokered the deal. The group said it is likely the single largest philanthropic contribution to land protection in Australia.   Related: Wolli Creek national park gains additional 4.7 hectares of land to complete \u2018green ribbon\u2019    The 352,000ha property had been for sale since 2016. It is located at the headwaters of the Lake Eyre Basin and will join existing national parks to create a conservation corridor of roughly 1.4m hectares. According to the Nature Conservancy\u2019s senior adviser for global protection, Dr James Fitzsimons, the property contains 34 ecosystems and ranks higher than 90% of existing national parks in the state for habitat representation. Fitzsimons said the purchase was critical to protect key habitat for threatened species, including the endangered night parrot and vulnerable yellow-footed rock-wallaby.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cThis is a really important way of showing philanthropic and government interest of meeting our national ambition of protecting 30% of the country by 2030,\u201d he said. \u201cA key part of growing Australia\u2019s [nature] reserve system is a focus of comprehensiveness and representatives, ensuring we are conserving samples of each type of ecosystem.\u201d There will be a two-year transition process to allow the current landowner to remove cattle from the property. Once it is converted to a national park, Queensland\u2019s network of protected areas will surpass 15m hectares \u2013 an area more than twice the size of Tasmania. The state government has also committed to engaging with the Maiawali traditional owners to undertake cultural heritage assessments on the property. The Nature Conservancy\u2019s interim managing director, Lara Gallagher, said the $21m donation \u201chighlights the power of leveraged gifts, enabling philanthropists and governments alike to achieve outcomes far beyond what is possible alone\u201d. Last year the Nature Conservancy and other environmental groups recommended the federal government establish a $5bn land acquisition fund to permanently protect high-value conservation land. \u201cWe really do hope this inspires other philanthropists to join with government \u2026 to protect more really important properties like this around the country,\u201d Fitzsimons said. The 2022 state of the environment report found climate change, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and mining had caused significant and ongoing deterioration of the environment and the Albanese government has since committed to protecting 30% of land by 2030 in an attempt to halt species extinctions and environmental degradation. An additional 60m hectares, an area three times the size of Victoria, will need to be protected by 2030 to reach the goal. The Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, said the government would contribute to the Vergemont purchase out of a $262.5m state fund dedicated to expanding and managing protected areas. Two neighbouring stations, Tonkoro station (138,200ha) and Melrose station (73,048ha), were bought by the state government this year to add to existing protected areas, chiefly the Diamantina, Goneaway and Bladensburg national parks. Linard said the new national park at Vergemont would bring visitors and employment opportunities for locally based contractors and park rangers. About 40,000ha of the 350,000ha property will remain as opal mining leases, with an additional 10,000ha slated as a \u201cbuffer\u201d area. \u201cWe will work to ensure an ecologically sustainable coexistence between the existing opal mining operations and conservation of the important natural and cultural values on the property,\u201d Linard said. \u201cWe will allow small-scale opal mining interests to continue their operations on suitable areas.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Contrasting polls spell out disaster territory and green shoots for Labor ahead of Queensland election [2024-09-14T20:00:39Z]": "Six weeks out from the Queensland election, two polls dropped this week. They both told remarkably different stories. \nResolve Strategic, published in the Brisbane Times, put Labor\u2019s primary vote across the state at 23%. That\u2019s disaster territory. For context, when Anna Bligh\u2019s Labor government was obliterated at the 2012 election, its primary vote was 26.7%. \nThe other poll, released by Redbridge, showed some green (pun intended) shoots for Steven Miles\u2019s election strategy, at least in Brisbane and its commuter suburbs. Some Labor MPs fighting uphill battles in city seats left parliament on Thursday \u2013 the final sitting day of the term \u2013 feeling more buoyant than at anytime this year. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe Redbridge poll, taken between May and August, showed Labor had made little or no inroads in the outer suburbs and regions. The numbers outside Brisbane have been dire in every poll and show no signs of shifting. And the LNP has a viable path to a majority government even if it only picks up seats north of the Sunshine Coast. \n \n  Related: Queensland Labor plans state-owned petrol stations as it bids for fourth term  \n \nBut curiously, the RedBridge snapshot shows Labor support had rebounded substantially in the inner and middle suburbs.

The party\u2019s historical strongholds are working-class cities along the central Queensland coast. It has never lost Mackay or Rockhampton. But both of these places look vulnerable. \nParty sources say three bellwether seats in Townsville are as good as lost. Voter sentiment in Cairns, where the party also holds three seats, is not as vicious as it is in Townsville, but still doesn\u2019t seem positive. \nTo get back in the reckoning \u2013 or at least deny the Liberal National party a majority \u2013 Labor needs to find a way to make inroads in the regions, and defend its seats there. \nIt\u2019s hard to guess at what sort of strategy might reverse that trend so late in the term; or at least one that wouldn\u2019t do the party harm in Brisbane, where the government\u2019s 50c public transport fares would be most popular with voters, helping vulnerable MPs. \nThe policy has been a resounding success on almost every front. Public transport usage is up substantially. Brisbane\u2019s CBD has felt busier than anytime since the Covid shutdown.

Then a high voltage power line was built through his family farm outside Chinchilla in 1984. The whispers of gas came with the turn of the millennium, and by the early 2010s, the coal seam gas industry was booming. Gas company Arrow Energy now holds a tenement over his property and a few doors down, there\u2019s a coal seam gas waste facility. \u201cNow we have traffic lights in town, more shops, and there\u2019s a lot more people around,\u201d Glen\u2019s wife, Barbara Beasley, says. \u201cBut when gas first came into the area there was a lot of resentment,\u201d Glen adds.    Today, expanding gas fields cover the landscape. Huge transmission lines crisscross fields of grazing cattle and crimson sorghum ready for harvest. Substations, pipelines and coal trains rolling by. There is another player in the mix now too: renewable energy. There are at least 17 operating wind and solar farms in south-east Queensland, five under construction, and 31 more in the pipeline. The majority of these projects are slated for the area Beasley\u2019s family has been farming for three generations: the Western Downs, which sits at the heart of Nationals leader David Littleproud\u2019s electorate of Maranoa. Littleproud has labelled Australia\u2019s renewable rollout as \u201cpure insanity\u201d, and opposes the Queensland LNP\u2019s decision to support the state government\u2019s 75% emissions reduction target by 2035. Littleproud says that his party isn\u2019t against renewables, \u201cbut we are concerned that renewable projects are losing their social licence\u201d. Low-hanging fruit Outside Littleproud\u2019s office, the renewable energy transition is already in full swing. The Western Downs is one of the most developed of the Queensland government\u2019s renewable energy zones \u2013 areas slated for a concentration of renewable projects. Australia\u2019s largest operating solar farm is just outside Chinchilla and joins at least seven other solar farms sitting next to power grid infrastructure built to support the fossil fuel industry. The co-location allows the area to sidestep the costly and contentious process of building new transmission lines.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Farms in the region are also generally larger and less fertile, which can make farmers more open to diversifying their income with energy developments, and, because of the gas industry, there is a skilled workforce already in place: one construction company alone, Western Downs Civil, employs 110 people and 60% of its work now comes from renewable projects.    \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect low hanging fruit scenario,\u201d says associate prof Kathy Witt, a principal research fellow at the University of Queensland\u2019s Gas and Energy Transition Centre. The region is so popular that developers are jockeying for space: the Beasleys were on the verge of signing a 30-year lease with a UK solar developer, before a surge of other solar projects caused the transmission line on his property to reach capacity. \u201cIt was a very attractive proposition for us and our children \u2026 and we could have put it on the least productive country,\u201d Glen says. \u201cIt seems almost inevitable they will upgrade [the line].\u201d The details of contracts between farmers and renewable developers are locked behind confidentiality agreements, but according to advocacy group Farmers for Climate Action the average annual compensation is about $40,000 a wind turbine and $1,500 a hectare of solar panels.      \u201cFor farmers its really significant income and it\u2019s constant, its regular, while farming isn\u2019t a regular income,\u201d says Paul Hudson, a Western Downs grazier. \u201cThe more marginal [the land], the more it means to them.\u201d Hudson was speaking after a community meeting last week for a planned 100-turbine windfarm in Goombi, west of Chinchillla. \u2018We haven\u2019t learned\u2019 The gas industry has laid the groundwork for the region\u2019s renewable rollout, the director of the University of Southern Queensland\u2019s Rural Economies Centre of Excellence, Prof Ben Lyons, says. \u201cThe renewable sector had a whole case-study from this region about how to get communities onside \u2026 but we haven\u2019t learned,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest regret I have about it.\u201d Lyons managed the community engagement process for AGL\u2019s Coopers Gap windfarm in 2020-2021. He says the renewable energy industry lacks regulation and transparency, independent oversight and relies on the goodwill of project developers to build social licence in communities.    Larger companies may invest in a community to help build social licence to operate, but not all developers take that time. A report by Andrew Dyer, a former Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner found some renewable energy companies have created anxiety and confusion in regional communities by not providing adequate information or properly addressing concerns. In renewable energy zones, encroaching development can feel overwhelming. Some landowners on the Darling Downs have been approached by as many as 12 different renewable energy developers.    I think partly it's an indecent haste on the part of some locals to believe in conspiracies  Glen Beasley     A prospective windfarm on the Southern Downs was shelved last month after a community meeting in the small town of Allora, where hundreds of people spilled from the doors of the local sports club in outrage over nine farmers being approached about a potential development. The Southern Downs state Liberal MP, James Lister, told the crowd: \u201cWe do have to fight because in the city they love this shit.\u201d A spokesperson from Wind Prospect, the Melbourne-based energy developer who met with the landowners, says while they expect some level of community resistance, \u201cit\u2019s unusual to experience opposition before a project is actually proposed\u201d. Glen Beasley says the lack of factual information about renewable projects has left a vacuum for misinformation to flourish. \u201cI think partly it\u2019s an indecent haste on the part of some locals to believe in conspiracies,\u201d Beasley says. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by the media too,\u201d Barbara adds. A Green Energy Markets report found the \u201cremarkable\u201d pace of recent renewable energy project approvals in Queensland has put it ahead of New South Wales in decarbonising its energy grid.    The Queensland government last week introduced legislation to expand the remit of the GasFields Commission to regulate the renewable energy rollout, under the new name \u201cCoexistence Queensland\u201d. Lyons says the state \u201cshould have been on to that five years ago\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of time to prepare for this, but we haven\u2019t.\u201d Adrian Story, a grazier with gas wells on his property, has graduated from a leadership program that aims to equip people with the skills to manage the energy transition. Story says the gas industry \u201cboth helped and hindered\u201d renewable developers. \u201cGas made a lot of mistakes early on by not doing early engagement \u2026 in some cases I\u2019m seeing those mistakes happen again with renewables,\u201d he says. Western Downs mayor, Andrew Smith, says the council, which has responsibility for approving solar projects but not gas or wind, fully supports the diversification of energy in the region. \u201cLet\u2019s leave the politics to the politicians, we are here to take advantage of where our nation is heading,\u201d Smith says.

[2024-06-22T00:00:17Z]": "On the picturesque foothills of the Great Dividing Range, west of Brisbane, sheep graziers Jim and Debbie Dieckmann woke up to a massacre. \u201cThe further I walked the more I saw, dead ones, others trying to get up with punctured lungs, their guts hanging out, udders torn to pieces,\u201d Jim says. \u201cIt\u2019s gut wrenching, it brings you to tears sometimes.\u201d In the early hours of the morning, almost all of their sheep were mauled by dogs. Once infection set in, the death count rose to 34 \u2013 about half their flock.    It\u2019s the deadliest attack by \u201cwild dogs\u201d \u2013 a catch-all term describing any canine roaming wild, including dingoes \u2013 that Jim has seen in 50 years of sheep grazing, and in this region, he says, and it\u2019s getting worse. The Dieckmanns used to run a commercial sheep property further west but down-sized to a smaller block (and flock) a few years ago. They now have one of a growing number of smaller land holdings subdivided from larger blocks that have popped up on Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard as tree-changers flock to the regions for a slice of country life.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  According to Greg Mifsud, the national wild dog management coordinator at the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions, that trend is contributing to a \u201cbreakdown of coordinated management programmes that kept those dog populations under control\u201d. Smaller holdings are less inclined to practise \u201cwild dog\u201d management, or are often too small to legally bait or shoot dogs on their property, Mifsud says. \u201cWe are now seeing dogs moving into areas and causing more harm,\u201d he says.    This shift in land ownership is also bringing more domestic dogs into rural areas, whose owners may be unaware of the risks of letting their dogs wander. Mifsud says tree-changers need to be aware of the \u201cadditional responsibilities of dog ownership\u201d that come when living near farmland. Debbie and Jim found a myriad of paw prints too large to be a dingoes after the attack, and they say the profile of the bites, mostly on the sheep\u2019s necks, suggest they came from a pack of rogue domesticated dogs. That distinction between a domestic dog and dingo is an important but often difficult one to make, says the Deakin University professor of wildlife and conservation, Euan Ritchie. \u201cWe need to make sure we attribute the cause to the right source,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s obviously influencing policy with regards to dingoes.\u201d That policy \u2013 wild dog control, which costs the economy an estimated $302m annually in management and agriculture losses \u2013 has proved highly contentious in Australia, splitting opinions among conservationists and First Nations peoples, challenging government departments, and differing from grazier to grazier. The debate\u2019s latest battleground is in Victoria, after the state government put an end to the killing of dingoes in the state\u2019s north-west to save the species from localised extinction. That makes it the first state to protect dingoes on private land.    The announcement was welcomed by conservationists, First Nations peoples and animal rights groups, but drew strong criticism from the Victorian Farmers Federation who say it will lead to more attacks on livestock. Its president, Emma Germano, says rural communities have been \u201cblind-sided\u201d by the announcement and are \u201ccompletely unprepared\u201d. In another incident in Victoria, a farmer will face court next month for allegedly shooting two domestic dogs on his property that were attacking his sheep. Meanwhile, reforms passed in South Australia last month increased penalties for owners of dogs that cause injury or death to another animal or person from $2,500 to a maximum of $25,000. How the issue is defined is contentious too. Conservationists are calling for the term \u201cwild dog\u201d to be dropped, after research found the majority of wild canines are purebred dingoes, rather than cross-breeds of introduced species as previously thought. But for graziers, this distinction is for the most part irrelevant, says Stephen Tully, the sheep, wool and goat president of Queensland\u2019s peak farming lobby group, Agforce. \u201cDingoes and wild dogs can\u2019t cohabitate with small livestock, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he says. Tully, a sheep grazier in western Queensland, says exclusion fencing, trapping and coordinated baiting have kept dog populations at a \u201cmaintenance level\u201d. Ritchie says research shows non-lethal approaches are a more effective and humane way to manage dingoes.    Queensland grazier Bruce McLeish has used guard donkeys to protect his flock. He says they significantly reduced the number of sheep killed by dogs, but are \u201cnot a cure, just another tool to try to minimise losses\u201d. Maremma sheepdogs are another popular guardian animal, but Mifsud says they can be a problem on smaller land holdings. \u201cTheir incessant barking just drove neighbours nuts,\u201d he says. On the Dieckmann\u2019s property, Jim has been feeding the surviving sheep hay in a small holding paddock while he extends the dog-proof fence around the entire property. Exclusion fencing can keep sheep safe but is costly and prohibits the movement of native wildlife through an area, Debbie says. \u201cThey aren\u2019t always greeted favourably within the community, but if your livelihood depends on keeping the animals out, what can you do?\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Australia\u2019s airline duopoly won\u2019t keep planes in regional skies | Gabrielle Chan [2024-08-12T15:00:48Z]": "I have been spending a bit of time in a courtroom in Wagga Wagga, watching a murder trial in my local area. In the collegial housekeeping moments between lawyers, there have been more than a few passing remarks about travel arrangements since Rex Airlines entered voluntary administration. Like many country courtrooms, the judge and some of the bar table are often fly-in-fly-out workers. They join professional contractors, tradies, health workers, public servants and other visitors who make up the 225,000 passengers to come through Wagga airport every year. The Wagga Wagga city council\u2019s 30-year airport lease from the defence department expires on 30 June next year. The mayor, Dallas Tout, said the council had been informed the federal government would then open the lease for expressions of interest and the council could apply along with anyone else.   Related: Rex Airlines holds a special place in the heart of country Australia. What would we do without it? | Claire Keenan    Air travel is an essential service in a big country. While the vast majority of regional airports were handed over for community use, Wagga is designated as a joint-use airport, because it\u2019s next to the Royal Australian Air Force base. It is also home to the army\u2019s recruit training centre at Kapooka. So the call for interest means the government airport, upgraded through ratepayers\u2019 funds, could be privatised because little ol\u2019 Wagga council will find it hard to compete against the muscle and deep pockets of private operators. Take Sydney airport as an example of where that might lead. It is in the news because it has been partly blamed for Rex Airlines\u2019 financial woes. For those who have never been on a Rex flight, it is very much a regional airline that operates on commercial routes as well as flights to more remote areas made in partnership with the Queensland government, to places including Thargomindah, Birdsville and Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria. A Rex flight is a very \u201ccountry\u201d experience. As my colleague Claire Keenan wrote, when you fly Rex as a country person, you often know half the people on the plane.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  There were a number of factors that have led to Rex\u2019s financial staggers. Infighting on the board was significant, between the former Nationals minister and now chairman, John Sharp, and the airline\u2019s largest shareholder, Lim Kim Hai. The airline\u2019s attempt to add a bit more competition to the capital city routes was ballsy but perhaps ill-advised \u2013 though I can see the attraction. Those 90-minute flights between Sydney and Melbourne generate more revenue than any other route in the world, according to industry data from November 2023. But we don\u2019t live in the mythical version of Australia that is the land of plucky little battlers, so attempting to out-compete larger airlines may have been doomed from the start. The Sydney airport slot manager is now majority-owned by Qantas and Virgin, the duopoly players on those routes. Sydney airport also has a curfew plus a limit of 80 aircraft movements an hour. Generally, regional New South Wales services cannot use a peak period slot unless it has historically been used only for regional NSW services. That means new players operating into those capital city routes including Rex and the short-lived Bonza are pushing manure uphill with a pointy stick. The former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission boss Rod Sims, who is now professor of public policy at the Australian National University, explained it like this to Radio National: \u201cWhen [competitors Rex or Bonza] want those key slots that they must have to be viable, they have to go and ask for them from Qantas and Virgin. And of course, they\u2019ve also got to put their business plans before them. \u201cSo the government sets this system up for failure. It sets this system up for a duopoly, and therefore sets the system up for higher aviation for higher airline prices than Australians should be paying.\u201d Six days after Rex\u2019s trading halt on 29 July, the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, announced \u2013 surprise! \u2013 that the government is opening tenders for the excellent title of Sydney airport slot manager. That\u2019s not a direct response to Rex\u2019s voluntary administration, it was a recommendation from a 2021 review by Peter Harris of Sydney airport\u2019s demand management scheme. King has already announced wider reforms in response to the Harris review, including what she termed as \u201cprotections for regional NSW communities\u201d, including the ability for regional services to apply for any peak period slot. The reforms also include requiring priority be given to regional flights but add that the slot manager will \u201cneed to balance this with other priorities like giving slots to larger aircraft\u201d \u2013 two recommendations that seem likely to cancel each other out. Sims said you could argue that Rex and Bonza \u201cshould have anticipated that the system was so rigged against them that they were doomed to fail\u201d. But is this the glorious age of open markets we were promised from the competition reforms in the 1990s? The prime minister was critical of Rex\u2019s attempt to crack the capital city routes but his government has hinted it would not let the airline fail as a regional service. Yet Guardian Australia has revealed that the government had previously turned down a plea by Bonza for financial help. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie accused the Albanese government of dithering on aviation reforms, though the 2021 Harris review was sitting on the desk of the Morrison government as well. And McKenzie may remember that it was Sharp, the now Rex chairman and National party elder, who put a cap on those Sydney airport movements during his time as transport minister in the Howard government, which made slots the second hottest property in Sydney after houses. Sharp has admitted his creation has come back to bite him. Back in Wagga, the Riverina MP, Michael McCormack, has extracted a stay of execution on the airport lease until 2026. A defence spokesperson would only say the department was working with the Wagga Wagga city council on options for the future operations of the airport. But private operators will be circling. Even if Rex has its wings clipped, there is still plenty of flying to be done in the regions. The truth is that Australian governments have slept while anti-competitive behaviour has crept into so many of our essential services, including airlines, supermarkets, farm supplies, the chicken industry, banks and electricity companies. Here\u2019s hoping they have learned something from that and keep essential services like country airports for the benefit of communities they serve. And here\u2019s to more competitive skies. Sic \u2019em, Rex.

But not all renewable projects require local government approval, meaning developers are left to deal directly with local residents \u2013 to mixed results. In New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, local councils generally have the power to approve solar farms, but not wind developments which lie with the state government. Linda Scott, the president of the Australian Local Government Association, said approval powers aside, local governments should be central in planning because it results in \u201cbetter community acceptance\u201d and \u201cspeedier approvals\u201d.   Related: Inside the renewable energy resistance in regional Australia - podcast    \u201cWhere local governments don\u2019t have planning approvals for any major infrastructure project, proponents often forget to speak to local government,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis is almost always a mistake.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Most of the footprint of the MacIntyre windfarm, the largest in the southern hemisphere, falls within the borders of Goondiwindi regional council in southern Queensland. The Goondiwindi mayor, Lawrence Springborg, said local councils want a greater say in renewable energy projects. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about being frustrating and just saying no for the sake of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe understand state priorities and prerogatives, we\u2019re not arguing against that. But in many ways that just sees things being waved through, often without consideration [for local communities].\u201d Springborg said localised economic benefits of the windfarm are not yet commensurate to the project\u2019s scale. \u201cIf we are hosting this for the benefit of our state or our nation or our planet, surely those hosting should be able to be a major beneficiary of economic opportunity,\u201d he said. The former energy infrastructure commissioner, Andrew Dyer, said while local councils can play an \u201cintegral part\u201d in the development of renewable projects, final planning approvals should remain with state and territory governments. He added that regional councils can face a conflict of interest if a councillor is a potential neighbour or host of a project, which he said is often the case. \u201cThe planning processes for wind, solar and storage systems are very complex,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cBy centralising planning, you centralise expertise.\u201d   Related: In the largest windfarm in the southern hemisphere, \u2018renewable energy farmers\u2019 look to the future    MacIntyre\u2019s footprint also partly extends into Southern Downs regional council. The mayor, Melissa Hamilton, said local government should have greater agency over how community benefit funds, established by most energy developers to build social licence, are distributed in regional communities. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be at the whim of the proponent deciding to do a few community charity items that they choose,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cNo one understands your local issues better than people on the ground.\u201d The president of Local Government NSW, Darriea Turley, said the energy transition must be carefully managed to reduce pressure on housing and infrastructure in regional communities. She said local government should be entrusted with community benefit funds to manage on behalf of the community, which could allow them to bring together the funding of multiple projects to pay for legacy community projects, like swimming pools and road upgrades. \u201cCollectively managed, the funds can put larger community needs within reach that may not have been possible using the benefit payment from one project alone,\u201d Turley said. There are 37 renewable energy projects planned, proposed or under construction in the NSW central-west Orana renewable energy zone, many of which lie within Dubbo regional council. The mayor, Mathew Dickerson, said one of local governments\u2019 \u201cgreatest frustrations\u201d is a void of policy to guide negotiations between councils and energy developers. \u201cYou want to get as much money as you can for your community, but how much is the right amount? What\u2019s fair and reasonable?\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cI feel like we would have failed as a council if we look back in 10 years\u2019 time and we don\u2019t think \u2018wow\u2019 we\u2019ve made the community a better place,\u201d he said.

The most infamous of them all was that of Flo Bjelke-Petersen, the former senator, wife of former Queensland premier Joh and maker of pumpkin scones. She argued that the curtains would fade and milking cows would get confused. While no one argues on the grounds of cows and curtains any more, perennial reasons cited in the bush against daylight saving include getting up in the dark, putting kids on buses in the dark and daylight differences between the western and eastern reaches of the states. The existence of daylight saving and its length is one of those issues where preferences mostly divide along city and country lines. It has hit the news again because the NSW Farmers Association recently voted in support of a campaign to clip the hours of daylight saving from the current six months each year. For those of us in New South Wales, the time change starts in October every year and I must admit, by about the end of February I have had enough.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  It is not something they put in the water out here. I have not been reprogrammed into some country-style Stepford Wife. I just like rising with the sun. And studies show there are good reasons to do it if you have that luxury. I don\u2019t use an alarm unless I have an early morning appointment or a plane to catch. I like watching the sun rise, using it to exercise and not feeling in a rush to start the working day.   Related: Farmers launch fresh campaign for NSW to cut daylight saving    I\u2019m not going to argue that farmers are a special breed who get up before everyone else. I know some of my city relatives get up a lot earlier than we do to beat the traffic and commute across the vast network of clogged metropolitan tollways or to stick to a rigid work schedule that requires them in the office by the crack of dawn. That means their kids \u2013 city kids \u2013 are also getting up in the dark, prodded awake when they are sleepy or cranky, with their stomachs not yet in gear for breakfast, before they head off to school or childcare or grandparents. Yet still those families prefer daylight saving. This is a cultural divide as much as anything else. Evidence is thrown around on both sides, such as the effect on sleep of changing clocks or the (erm) inconclusive findings on energy savings by using more daylight hours. Honestly, my preference is as scientific as how I use the day. I wake up with the birds. In Queensland, land of Flo, I reckon there have been more fights about daylight saving than anywhere on the planet. Queensland did introduce daylight saving with the first world war, as did the rest of Australia and it was reintroduced in the second world war. Then it was dropped acround the country until Tasmania introduced it in 1967 to save on hydroelectricity because of a severe drought. Less water meant less power. From the 1970s, different states introduced different regimes \u2013 or none, in the case of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. In Queensland, it borders on a culture war, where the south-eastern part of the state votes differently to the rest on daylight saving (and most other issues).   Related: \u2018No one understands local issues better\u2019: rural councils call for greater role in renewable energy transition    In March 1973, then premier Bjelke-Petersen appointed a committee on daylight saving to look at the effects on Queensland \u2013 not of a potential daylight saving change in the state, but of the effect of daylight saving in other states on Queensland.  There is a political adage that you never call an inquiry unless you know the answer. Joh\u2019s committee found there was an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of Queensland\u2019s women who did not favour daylight saving. Nor did farmers or elderly people \u2026 Queensland\u2019s geography, it concluded, was simply not suited to it. Then in 1992, Queenslanders were called to vote in a simple referendum: are you in favour of daylight saving? They were not, with 54.5% voting no and 45.5% voting yes. If you split the results between urban and rural, the difference was \u2013 well \u2013 day and night. According to Antony Green, of the 53 seats in the urban south east, the yes vote won 60.6% to 39.4%. In the southern Gold Coast it was 70% in favour. In Warrego, in the south-western corner of the state, the no vote was as high as 91% and other western and northern seats were close behind. \u201cIn the 36 seats covering the rest of the state, the yes vote was clobbered 22.9% to 77.1% no,\u201d he wrote. Frankly, I think the cultural divide is not so much about agriculture, although farming lobbies have strong views on it and most farmers tend to be out at sparrow\u2019s fart. I suspect it is the difference of place, of life preferences and the options open to them. A 1990 Queensland cabinet paper before the vote suggested factors that influenced the no vote in submissions to government included \u201cnon-specific\u201d (22%), climate (13%), children and school (both 11%), family lifestyle (10%). Primary production was only cited by 6%. I interpret non-specific as \u201cI know what I like\u201d. Those submitting in favour of daylight saving included business (23%), recreation (21%) and tourism (21%). When you live or work close to the border, dealing with companies and office hours across time zones is a bit of a nightmare. Back in NSW, the premier, Chris Minns, has knocked the NSW Farmers\u2019 idea on the head. His was a numbers game, that being democracy. Unlike Flo, I don\u2019t rule my state so I know I won\u2019t win. But I might try to bake some of those pumpkin scones. And I will be doing it first thing in the morning.

The former national energy infrastructure commissioner Andrew Dyer says there\u2019s no credible evidence that suggests property values are systemically affected. But he added there \u201cmay be particular examples where it may have an impact\u201d. Mansbridge, sobbing in her living room as she speaks to Guardian Australia, is one of those examples.

To compensate for disruptions during construction, they provided Mansbridge with a $110 voucher to spend at the local RSL in town, a new water filter to combat construction dust and dug a few holes on her property for trees to eventually block views of solar panels creeping up a distant hill. They also washed the dust off her house once construction was complete. A neighbour received a voucher for a massage to deal with the stress. In a statement, a Metlen Energy &amp; Metals spokesperson said the company was committed to working with the Kingaroy community to address social and environmental issues and was prioritising complaints with the \u201cutmost care and attention\u201d. \u201cWe strictly adhere to all regulations and standards set by all relevant authorities and levels of governance,\u201d they said.    Another landowner whose property backs the solar farm, who did not wish to be named, says the proponent\u2019s lawyers \u201cflat out refused\u201d any form of significant compensation. They feel helpless. And this, compounded by a sense that rural Australia is carrying an unfair burden for the country\u2019s energy transition, is feeding growing animosity towards the renewable energy rollout in regional areas. Poor community engagement by some developers contributes to that animosity. It\u2019s then layered over mis- and disinformation spreading online to create a febrile environment which has been stoked for political gain. Lacklustre community consultation was one reason behind the South Burnett regional council\u2019s decision to call for a moratorium on renewable energy projects unless strict conditions were met. \u201cIt\u2019s about allowing time to get the planning guidelines right,\u201d says the mayor, Kathy Duff.   Related: Fury road: a forlorn hope that, for once, Australia would choose the hard path on climate | Calla Wahlquist    The original proponent of the solar farm, Terrain Solar, took the council to the Queensland planning and environment court after it knocked back the development application in 2018. After slight adjustments were made to the plans, the project was approved. \u201cIf we go against a development application, the planning court just overrules it \u2026 we have no say where these are going to end up,\u201d Duff says. The solar farm was approved by state and local governments in early 2020. Mansbridge bought her property in January 2021 but says that because of the change in developers she didn\u2019t know at the time that the project was still going ahead. Damien Martoo, the president of the Kingaroy chamber of commerce, says there is more to be gained by working with renewable developers than trying to use roadblocks that \u201copen the door for these developers to go elsewhere or through the back door\u201d. \u201cIf [the proposed development] is ticking all their boxes by law, then it\u2019s going to happen anyway. You might as well build the relationships and make sure we are entitled to every cent, every piece of compensation we can get,\u201d he says. Martoo says the consultation methods used by some developers have left communities feeling cold. The failure to compensate neighbouring landholders for direct impacts or loss of property values has also further soured the relationship. \u201cPeople want to sit down with a real person and have their concerns heard,\u201d Martoo says. \u201cIt\u2019s coffee and cake or beer and a steak.\u201d Locals in Kingaroy tell Guardian Australia they are concerned about inappropriate development and loss of local amenity.

But through social media and presentations like McCallum\u2019s, the same messages ripple through. \nIt started with transmission lines \nAbout 100km north of Kilcoy, lush cattle pastures line the Wide Bay Highway. Then comes the solar farm: sheets of dark glass rolling over undulating pastures, power lines bowing overhead. Nailed to an odd gum tree by the road\u2019s shoulder are the signs of protest: Powerlink, our gates are locked. \nIt\u2019s in this battleground that McCallum, an ex-Queensland police officer, had her political awakening. In late 2022 locals came into her general store in Kilkivan and told her that Powerlink, Queensland\u2019s state-owned transmission company, was proposing to build 500KW transmission lines through properties outside town to connect the proposed Borumba pumped hydro project to the grid. \nBorumba is considered one of the most significant projects in Queensland\u2019s energy transition. The construction of the transmission lines would involve clearing native vegetation. McCallum considers herself a conservationist, but like most leaders in the anti-renewable campaign, she does not believe in human-induced global heating. \nThe campaign is framed around environmental concerns but, speaking to locals, their main concern is loss of amenity. Kilkivan, like many hotbeds of anti-renewable sentiment, is a mix of farmland plus hobby and lifestyle blocks. \u201cYou spend all your life working in cities, doing the hard yards and then you get to come up here to retire, and they are putting that in our back yards?\u201d says the retired truck driver Matt Cosgriff. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing.\u201d \n \n Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \n \nThe proposed route would see the transmission lines erected about 500 metres from Gillian Stephens\u2019 home on her cattle property. Stephens says it has added an \u201cunimaginable stress\u201d to her and her husband\u2019s life. \u201cIt\u2019ll absolutely destroy the beauty of the place,\u201d she says. \nA local real estate agent, Stuart Hill, says there are mixed feelings on properties within the proposed corridor. In Queensland, landowners receive an average of $300,000 per kilometre of transmission lines that crosses their property. \n\u201cSome are outright against it, others are of the opinion that if we can\u2019t stop it, let the money roll in,\u201d he says. \n\u2018I\u2019m stuck here\u2019 \nAbout 70km away from Kilkivan, in the town of Kingaroy, the pensioner Karen Mansbridge is crying in her living room. \u201cI want to get out,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t, I\u2019m stuck here, it\u2019s keeping me here.\u201d \nFor eight months Mansbridge has been trying to sell her house to move closer to her children. \nRural lifestyle blocks like hers are in high demand and should sell within 30 days. \u201cBut once people realise it\u2019s next to a solar farm they aren\u2019t interested,\u201d her real estate agent says. \nThe project was opposed by the local South Burnett regional council, but eventually approved through the land and environment court. Mansbridge and her neighbours have not received meaningful compensation: when construction noise was bad she received a $110 voucher for a meal at the local RSL. \n\u201cThey took one look at us and thought, they don\u2019t have the money,\u201d a neighbour, who did not wish to be named, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe arrogance of that.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a genuine grievance, which has been plugged into a broader campaign filled with misinformation and disinformation. \nLast week the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and candidate for Nanango, Adam Maslen, who also attended the Kilcoy meeting, visited Mansbridge\u2019s property and encouraged her to speak at a One Nation event. \nOne Nation has already recruited McCallum, who has been preselected as its candidate for Gympie. This was not disclosed at the Kilcoy meeting. \nCommunity meetings, just like the online debate, are falling along partisan lines. \n\u2018Noisy minority\u2019 \nDistant storm clouds obscure the view of the Coopers Gap windfarm from the second storey of Kevin White\u2019s Kingaroy home. It is one of two windfarms west of town, with more proposed. \nWhite says online discourse about the proposed developments has been \u201cvicious\u201d.  \n\u201cI worry that the noisy minority is having a larger than warranted impact on local council decision-making,\u201d he says. \nCommunity Facebook groups have become \u201cmelting pots\u201d of misinformation and disinformation, says the director of Queensland University of Technology\u2019s Digital Media Research Centre, Prof Daniel Angus. Genuine concerns and questions are lumped in with conspiracy theories. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have quality news and information you leave space there for the taking for anyone who can fill it with whatever crap they like,\u201d he says. \nFacebook is a key recruiting ground for Nren. Willmott\u2019s community presentation includes a survey conducted by Nren and Property Rights Australia that was distributed through anti-renewable groups on the social media platform, and is an effective census on its members: just 13% of respondents were 44 years old or under and the most common occupation selected was retired. \n Interactive \n \nFurther down the Wide Bay Highway is Jo Schembri and Jim Mewburn\u2019s cattle property. Last year they accepted an offer from Ag Energy Australia to build a battery energy storage system on the property. \nThey now work part-time for that developer to engage with farmers interested in hosting a renewable energy project on their own land, and have spoken to more than 20 farmers from New South Wales and Queensland. The right development can be \u201clife-changing\u201d for farmers, Mewburn says, providing economic stability on otherwise marginal country \u2013 made more marginal by an increasingly unpredictable climate. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten why we are doing this in the first place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to take action as soon as possible to start to minimise the effect we\u2019re having on the planet.\u201d \nStuart Nicholson lives at an off-grid property north of Kingaroy, and works installing solar pumps on farms. He says the majority of farmers he speaks to are not against renewable energy projects, but are confused by the \u201cpolitical footballing\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re getting different messages from different political persuasions about the cost of electricity,\u201d he says. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nOne of the political footballs is 30km south of Kingaroy. The Tarong coal-fired power station has been named as one of seven potential sites for the Coalition\u2019s proposed nuclear reactors. The state LNP does not support the suggestion. \nBut on the streets of Kingaroy, locals tell Guardian Australia that if nuclear power is a substitute for the \u201creckless\u201d renewable rollout, then it\u2019s a great idea. \nAfraid to speak up \nGetting straight information about proposed developments is difficult. \nIn March, McCallum and Willmott delivered their presentation at Allora in Queensland\u2019s Southern Downs region, after some landowners were approached by a windfarm developer. They were invited by the landowner and local president of lobby group AgForce, Graham Park. \n \n  Related: First lockdown, then the voice, now renewables? Anti-government groups find new energy in environment battles   \n \nOther landowners, who were in favour of the proposal, also attended. They moved to the back of the room as the crowd rallied behind McCallum\u2019s rhetoric. \nDown the road from Allora, in Greymare, a fight is brewing between farmers who are interested in playing host to a windfarm \u2013 which would earn them about $40,000 per turbine a year \u2013 and the owners of small hobby farms which are too small to host a turbine. No project has been approved for the area, but that has not stopped the vitriol. \n\u201cThere\u2019s angry people out there, it\u2019s put us on opposing sides,\u201d says Lindy Bennett, the owner of a small hobby farm who organised a snap meeting in opposition to a prospective windfarm. \nCynthia McDonald, a farmer in talks with a wind developer, and also a local councillor, says farmers \u201cshouldn\u2019t be held to ransom\u201d by other landholders. \u201cOnce the turbines go on, they just become part of the landscape, you grow used to these things,\u201d she says. \nIn a small community near Ipswich there\u2019s another community meeting. A children\u2019s petting zoo and community barbecue provide the backdrop for opposition to a proposal to build the largest battery storage project in Australia. Grant Kahler, who hosted the meeting on his lifestyle block, says their local campaign became more active after it was addressed by McCallum and Willmott in February. \nThe proposed project would be built on Ross and Steve Blanch\u2019s dairy farm. \u201cI\u2019ve been working here since 1972, seven days a week, 365 days a year,\u201d Ross says. \u201cThe last thing we want to do, at our age, is go through another drought like the last one.\u201d \nBlanch says he has spoken to almost 100 people in the region about selling his farm to the project developer and the majority say: \u201cRoss, you gotta do what you gotta do\u201d. \n\u201cI bet you there\u2019s not one genuine, full-time farmer against what we are doing,\u201d he says. \n \n Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter \n Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community \n", "Feeding seaweed supplement to cattle halved methane emissions in Australian feedlot, study finds  [2024-08-17T20:00:08Z]": "It takes a tasty treat to lure a cow\u2019s head into the narrow channel of a solar-powered contraption mounted to the back of a trailer. Once inside, and munching away at the sweet pellet, sensors measure the potency of the animal\u2019s methane-laden burps. By the water trough, another device calculates the cow\u2019s weight, and over the fence tubs of feed on scales record how much it eats. Like the other 19,000 cattle at Kerwee Feedlot, 150km west of Brisbane, the 80 cows in this pen are fed a twice-daily ration of freshly milled wheat and barley. But in the mix there\u2019s an added supplement derived from Asparagopsis, a species of red seaweed shown in some studies to reduce the methane output of cows. This is one of the longest commercial trials of the additive to date.    Globally, methane released by burping livestock, namely cattle, accounts for an estimated 5.5%-5.7% of all human-induced global heating. It is also responsible for the majority of emissions in Australia\u2019s livestock sector.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  This feedlot, with the exception of the hi-tech monitoring equipment in one pen, is a standard set-up: cattle arrive from farms, spend a few hundred days fattening up for slaughter, and are then trucked to an abattoir. There are 57 feedlots just like it within a few hundred kilometres of Kerwee \u2013 almost half of Australia\u2019s feedlot capacity.   Related: \u2018There\u2019s 20% more methane than they thought\u2019: new data confirms Australia has been undercounting cattle    The trial at Kerwee involved feeding a commercial Asparagopsis supplement in the form of an infused canola oil over 200 days. The study involved 160 Angus steers in total, including a control group. The results, published in the journal of Translational Animal Science, found methane emissions in the cattle fed the supplement reduced by more than half (a 51.7% reduction in production and 50.5% reduction in yield) when taken on average over the length of the trial, with a peak in methane reduction at 91% on day 29.    The taste and quality of the meat was not affected and cattle fed the supplement gained 20kg more than those without. The results are a vast improvement on a net methane reduction of 19% in wagyu cattle observed in a 2023 study, and Associate prof Fran Cowley, who leads the University of New England\u2019s ruminant research group, says actual abatement may be higher than that recorded by the field instruments. The only catch is that the cattle were in a feedlot, which account for less than 1% of the industry\u2019s methane emissions. Cowley says reducing methane emitted from cattle grazing on farms will be far more difficult. \u201cFeedlots are the best case scenario for the efficacy of [methane] inhibition and ease of adoption for producers,\u201d Cowley says. \u201cWhen we get out into grazing systems, things get much, much harder.\u201d    The vast majority of Australia\u2019s 27.8 million beef cattle spend most of their lives grazing in often-far flung paddocks, where it\u2019s not possible to hand-feed daily supplements. Early results from a pen trial in March of a lick block infused with emissions inhibitors, which could be deployed in some paddocks, saw an on-average 12% abatement of methane. Other strategies to reduce on-farm methane emissions include a raft of nascent technology including releasing additives into drinking water, selective breeding and improving the efficiency of farms.   Related: Methane emissions: Australian cattle industry suggests shift from net zero target to \u2018climate neutral\u2019 approach    Cowley estimates a mix of interventions could yield a 15%-20% methane reduction in Australia\u2019s beef cattle herd by 2030. That would still fall short of the federal government\u2019s commitment to cut methane emissions by a third in the same period, in line with global targets. Climate scientists say methane emissions must be cut by 60% to limit the worst effects of global heating. The easiest way to do that, according to a global survey of 210 climate and food systems scientists, is to reduce rates of red meat consumption. \u2018Pretty serious costs\u2019 Even in feedlots, the commercial viability of additives such as Asparagopsis remains unclear. Marcus Doumany, the chief operating officer of Stockyard Beef, the owner of Kerwee Feedlot, says it is not currently viable to roll out the supplement across all its hundred pens. \u201cWe are looking at some pretty serious costs to industry to make this happen,\u201d Doumany says. \u201cIt\u2019s that classic early commercialisation phase, everyone is trying to work out when and what to do.\u201d Cowley says the feed additives are at \u201cresearch prices\u201d but will fall as adoption and production ramps up. Alex Baker, the chief executive of FutureFeed, the licence distributors of the red seaweed supplement, \u201cfirmly believes\u201d the productivity benefit \u2013 the slight weight gain, which Doumany described as \u201cmodest\u201d \u2013 will drive a strong economic case for adoption.    Government incentives may also make adoption more enticing. The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water is assessing a proposal to that would allow producers to be issued Australian carbon credit units in exchange for methane emissions abatement with feed additives. Baker says, if approved, the scheme would provide \u201cadditional confidence\u201d to producers but predicts it would take at least 18 months until its up and running. Global livestock methane emissions are projected to increase by 30% by 2050 under current policies.

He and his doctors fly out to remote patients in Normanton, Doomadgee, Karumba, Magnetic Island and many other towns. But in his advocacy work, Clements still comes up against the attitude that medical care should only happen where doctors want to provide it. \n \n Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads \n \n\u201cSome doctors say: \u2018I choose to live in the city and if people want good healthcare, they\u2019ve got to come to me\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they want to live in Woop Woop, then that\u2019s their fault. They just have to travel and deal with it. \n \n  Related: In rural Australia, everyone knows your business \u2013 so it\u2019s harder for victims of violence to get help | Gabrielle Chan  \n \n\u201cUrban narcissism is this concept that medical care only happens where they want to provide it and care is best in the city.\u201d \nThis is not a new view and it is worth pointing out that rural people can have prejudicial attitudes towards urban people too. (If I hear about latte sippers again, I may scream.) \nAnd there has long been a tension surrounding the level of services required in rural and remote communities, in a very large country with a relatively small population and an even smaller number of taxpayers. \nBut, increasingly, healthcare in rural areas is not working for either the population nor the healthcare workers who serve them, because care is getting more expensive and complex and patient expectations are rising. Added to the burden are the bureaucratic rules which determine how services operate along various regional boundaries and state borders \u2013 so much so that some injured people have called their neighbours rather than emergency services. \nFrankly, the dollars aren\u2019t there to pay for these complexities. A report commissioned by the National Rural Health Alliance from Nous consultancy dug into multiple government and academic datasets last year and found the annual spending gap between urban and rural citizens was $6.55bn, or close to $850 a person a year. \nBear in mind that equal spending per capita does not necessarily equate to the same level of services between cities and the regions, because it costs more to deliver healthcare the further you are from a capital city. That makes the real gap even larger. \n \n  \n  Without the most basic of services like adequate healthcare, it might be time for all of us in the regions to move to larger cities \n  \n \nIf you are thinking you have heard this sad song before, let me remind you of the statistics. \nAs recently as 2021, a woman living in a remote area was expected to die 16 years earlier than a woman in a city. Men in remote areas are expected to die 13 years earlier than their city counterparts, according to Rural Flying Doctor Service Best for the Bush 2023 report. \nThe NRHA report showed patients don\u2019t have access to, or are putting off, seeing health workers. In some places, that means medicating symptoms more because of lack of access to doctors. If you can\u2019t see a physiotherapist or pain specialist about a chronic back injury, you take a pill. If you have blurry vision and can\u2019t see a specialist, you continue to drive and use the $10 chemist glasses to read. \nRural people present with worse conditions and that drives increased hospital spending. Indeed, we are fronting up to emergency departments more, at a rate of 423 per 1,000 people compared with 309 in urban centres. \nSome don\u2019t get help unless a limb is dangling. The report found obvious geographical differences in leading causes of preventable deaths rates between major cities and very remote settings. Diabetes deaths are 3.8 times higher in remote areas, suicide rates are 2.3 times higher and coronary artery disease is 1.7 times higher. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nIt is not much better for allied health and disability services. NDIS patients in remote areas receive less than 70% of the funding for each person as their urban counterparts. You can\u2019t use the funds if you don\u2019t have the service providers. Rural and regional people access one-third less funding for dentistry work than urban areas, and that disparity increases as you get to more remote communities. \nYet, compared to our population share, rural industries such as farming, mining, and tourism make up a disproportionately large portion of Australia\u2019s economic output. If you can\u2019t get good healthcare (or education or childcare), who will be in those workforces? \nMany people discovered this during the regional migration boom, when new residents tried to access services in their new towns. Some suggested, it was tougher than they thought with \u201cno family, no friends and no backup\u201d. \nStill, you may continue to think that smaller and more spread out populations in rural and remote areas do not justify increased spending.  \nI don\u2019t think many rural people expect a teaching hospital in a town of 2,000. We just want a doctor. As Clements points out: \u201cWe need people out here [in remote Australia], because that\u2019s how we function and that\u2019s how we eat, and that\u2019s how we survive\u201d. \nWithout the most basic of services like adequate healthcare, it might be time for all of us in the regions to move to larger cities.

Nine per cent of mosquito traps in Queensland, most of which were located in the state\u2019s south-east, have tested positive for the virus, which causes swollen and painful joints, fever and rash. The virus is spread from mosquitoes to humans but can\u2019t be transmitted from person to person. People usually recover a few weeks after the initial infection but some can experience symptoms for months.   Related: \u2018The roadside version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\u2019: Queensland\u2019s trivia signs keeping drivers alert    Dr Stephen Conaty from New South Wales Health said warm and wet conditions meant \u201csignificant numbers\u201d of mosquitos were also expected in NSW over the next several weeks, particularly in the state\u2019s north. \u201cEaster can be a busy time with people travelling around NSW to visit family or friends, spending time outdoors and engaging in activities like camping,\u201d Conaty said. \u201cThere is no specific treatment for these viruses.

Victoria has recored eight cases between 1 January and 3 March.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said Ross River virus infections usually began to rise with the onset of rainy and warm weather in December and peaked in February and March. \u201cIt is also typical to see a significant number of Ross River virus cases every three to four years, so we are on track for a spike in cases,\u201d Gerrard said. There were more than 3,000 confirmed cases in the state in the last big surge in 2020.  A Queensland Health spokesperson said the state\u2019s infections may remain high during April and May but there was normally a reduction during cooler months. Health authorities have recommended that people in mosquito-prone areas regularly apply insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin or lemon eucalyptus oil; wear clothing to cover up their arms, legs and feet; and avoid going outside at dawn or dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Containers holding standing water around homes should also be emptied where possible. Assoc Prof Francesca Frentiu from the Queensland University of Technology said above average temperatures and rainfall had contributed to surges in mosquito-borne viruses but the risk of infection was highly dependent on local conditions.   Related: Queensland to become first state to introduce permanent pill-testing clinics    \u201cBecause of the complexity of how the virus is transmitted, it\u2019s not always clear what the primary driver of infections are,\u201d Frentiu said. \u201cGenerally if we\u2019ve got lots of virus transmission among hosts \u2013 usually marsupials, birds and livestock, which mosquitoes then bite and contract the virus themselves \u2013 then that tends to spill over into human transmission as well.\u201d Proximity to stagnant bodies of water where mosquitos breed also played a role, Frentiu said.

The Carbon Transport and Storage Corporation (CTSCo), a subsidiary of mining giant Glencore, is awaiting state government approval for a pilot scheme to inject Co2 emitted by a coal-fired power station in southern Queensland into underground water aquifers as part of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project trial. Farming and environmental groups say the project risks causing irreversible damage to the Great Artesian Basin, a vital freshwater source for farmers and one of the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest environmental assets\u201d.

Taking the matter to court was a last resort, he said. The federal environment department said projects that fell outside what could be currently assessed under the EPBC Act did not need to undergo federal environmental assessment. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, referred questions to the department. \u201cLegally, neither the minister nor the department can consider matters that fall outside national environment law,\u201d the department said in a statement to Guardian Australia. According to CTSCo modelling, the pilot project would create a 1.6km-wide \u201cplume area\u201d some 2.3km underground.  The ground water within the plume area would be unsuitable for livestock. But Glencore says there are no farmers currently extracting water at this depth within a 50km radius of the planned injection site. The Queensland environment department is currently reviewing the project\u2019s environmental impact statement, with a decision expected by May 2024. A state government spokesperson said there were \u201cstrict regulatory requirements\u201d in place to assess CCS projects. The director of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said he stood \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with AgForce and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation in opposing the project. He said the conservation group had been lobbying the federal government to include a requirement to assess the impact of CCS projects on underground aquifers in an impending overhaul of the EPBA Act. \u201cWe are calling for that expansion of nature laws to protect the Great Artesian Basin from the impacts of projects such as this,\u201d he said.

If found to have a disability or mental health condition, she would have been eligible to be diverted from a criminal penalty under the Mental Health Act; the underlying challenges she was facing supported and treated. \n  \n \nWithout access to this diversion, she faced a criminal penalty. Clifford describes what has happened to her in the two years since that first interaction with the court as like being stuck in \u201cquicksand\u201d. \n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been given the opportunity to address those underlying risk factors and so continues to come before the courts,\u201d he says, adding she continues to face criminal penalties. \u201cThat cycle just perpetuates itself.\u201d \n \n Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads \n \nDiversions have been proven to stem youth reoffending, while also providing the treatment that could help change the course of children\u2019s lives. But the specialist teams that aid this diversion do not operate the service in all courts across the state. There isn\u2019t one in many of the areas \u2013 including Orange, Tamworth, Walgett or Moree \u2013 which have been the centre of the recent youth crime crackdown. \nAdvocates say this is seeing magistrates faced with two choices for young people: custody or bail, with reoffenders facing the harsher bail conditions recently enacted by the government. \n\u201cIf the government is concerned about recidivism, we know from evidence that [diversion] is effective, yet it\u2019s almost wholly inaccessible in those locations,\u201d says Clifford. \n\u2018They\u2019re going to keep returning\u2019 \nThe most exhaustive survey examining the health of New South Wales children in custody was last carried out by the government in 2015, with a new one to be completed at the end of this year. The 2015 survey found 83% of young people in custody met the threshold for a psychological disorder. \nDespite this, a 2018 NSW inquiry into youth diversion found that only about 1.5% of young defendants in the local court are diverted from a criminal penalty via a treatment plan to help address their condition. The main reason for this low figure was because of a lack of the services needed in courts. \n \n  Related: NSW police say they will keep locking up young offenders but advocates say approach is \u2018draconian\u2019  \n \nThe inquiry recommended that the adolescent court and community teams, which are run by Justice Health that conducts the mental health assessments and treatment plans in courts, be available in every court dealing with young offenders. It also recommended increased funding for mental health support services to which courts can refer young offenders. \nThe courts in Bourke and Dubbo, which have also become the focus of the youth crime crackdown do have an adolescent court and community team. \nBut Prof John Kasinathan, a University of Sydney expert in adolescent forensic psychiatry, says the government is yet to provide the funding to see it scaled up. Kasinathan says this is a problem amid the youth crime crackdown in the regions. \nEarlier this year the Minns government introduced new laws to make it harder for reoffending 14- to 18-year-olds who commit serious break-and-enter or motor vehicle theft offences to get bail. \nKasinathan says the changes have seen more young people placed into custody, particularly in the regions, because the lack of mental health clinicians there means magistrates have no option to offer a diversionary program. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cIf they\u2019re putting money into a youth crime crackdown in the regions, what they should equally be doing is putting money into mental health diversion programs in the regions, because that\u2019s actually what\u2019s going to help people long term,\u201d Kasinathan says. \n\u201c[Having kids in custody] might reduce the crime because they\u2019re locked up, but then the moment they\u2019re out, if they\u2019ve got nothing better to do, and the conditions are not treated still, then they\u2019re going to keep returning.\u201d \nA report Kasinathan co-authored and released in 2022 found that mental health court diversion programs have the dual benefit of addressing the treatment needs of children and reducing reoffending. \nBut the report found from 2008 to 2015 fewer than half of young people deemed eligible for formal mental health diversion were granted such a diversion. Indigenous kids in particular were significantly less likely to be granted a diversion even though they were eligible. \nThis is despite Indigenous young people who face the justice system having higher rates of mental health challenges and cognitive impairments than non-Indigenous kids, according to the 2018 NSW inquiry into youth diversion. \nAnxiety and escalating violence \nMoree has become a focus in the youth crime crackdown as it faces a serious but now familiar problem across parts of regional NSW: young people breaking into houses and stealing keys to take cars on joy rides. \nIt does not have an adolescent court and community team in the local court. \n\u201cThere\u2019s just no Justice Health provisions here to be able to help diagnose mental health conditions or behavioural conditions that these young people have and put the diversionary programs in place,\u201d says Thomas Duncan, manager of community-led change in Moree for JustReinvest. \n \n  Related: What is FASD, and why do so many children with it end up in Australia\u2019s justice system?  \n \n\u201cThe impact of this is we have kids getting around with high anxiety levels and engaging in some pretty bad risk-taking behaviours that are becoming more and more violent and without the right support or right diagnosis.\u201d \nDuncan says he is optimistic that recent announcements by the government \u2013 which includes $8.75m for bail accommodation and support services to be co-designed with the community \u2013 will see more wraparound services for young people who offend. \nBut he says there are not enough resources to help young people before they come into contact with the justice system. \n\u201cWe have a six-month wait again to see a psychologist or a six-week wait to see a counsellor,\u201d he says. \nAn estimated 180,000 children in rural NSW are in need of childhood development services that are not available in their region, according to the healthcare charity Royal Far West. \nLawyers working for community legal services say they\u2019re doing what they can with the resources they have to get young people assessed. Bill Dickens, a solicitor for Legal Aid, says it sometimes arranges psychologists to assess young people facing court in remote areas, but it\u2019s a \u201cvery expensive undertaking\u201d. \n\u201cWe can really only justify paying for it if the child\u2019s charged with a sufficiently serious offence. If the child\u2019s charged with a minor offence, then we find it hard to justify paying for the psychologist to conduct the testing,\u201d he says. \nA spokesperson for the NSW government pointed to the more than $100m of additional funding it has committed towards youth justice, and said the adolescent court and community teams operates at all nine of the state\u2019s part-time and full-time children\u2019s courts across Sydney and other parts of the state. \n\u201cAdolescent court and community teams form part of suite of early intervention and diversion programs to help at-risk young people and improve community safety,\u201d said a NSW government spokesperson. \n\u201cWe are committed to helping at-risk young people onto a more positive path.

The peak body for producers of grass-fed cattle put forward the suggestion on Friday in a consultation paper outlining a proposed industry-led land management policy in response to growing global demands for deforestation-free products. The paper has already drawn strong criticism from Australia\u2019s leading environment groups, who say the cattle industry is trying to develop a watered-down definition of deforestation.   Related: Move to protect Australian beef industry from EU land clearing laws criticised by scientists    Greenpeace, the Wilderness Society and the Australian Conservation Foundation released their own policy guidance on deforestation for businesses in the beef supply chain, in response to the Cattle Australia position. Dr Don Butler, an ecologist at the Australian National University, said that based on the position outlined in the Cattle Australia land management information paper, \u201cit appears they are seeking to leave as broad an avenue as possible for their membership to continue to do what a lot of other people would see as deforestation in the management of their land\u201d. Cattle Australia has said it is attempting to develop an industry definition of deforestation that could allow farmers to gain a deforestation-free credential, which it hopes would be recognised by the supply chain.  The Australian government is seeking to protect the Australian beef industry from new laws in the European Union which will ban the import of goods produced in areas where land clearing occurs. Those laws are due to come into effect in January 2025. The consultation paper proposes a 1990 baseline be established, using old satellite imagery, to determine whether land is under agriculture use. This means regrowth forest that is more than 30 years old could be cleared without it being considered deforestation. \u201cIt\u2019s really an attempt to leave those areas of regrowth open to clearing,\u201d Butler said.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  International forest definitions used in supply chains do not include forests on land predominantly used by agriculture. When applied in an Australian context, Butler said those definitions could be used as \u201ca big loophole\u201d because 44% of Australia\u2019s forests lie within agriculture properties. \u201c[The paper] is an attempt to use the concept of agriculture as a big loophole. I would encourage Cattle Australia to avoid that outcome \u2026 it would be a mistake.\u201d The consultation paper said the \u201cunclear\u201d international definitions make it challenging to delineate between areas of primary forest and agricultural land. \u201cA key focus of this work is to provide clarity in a way that is internationally credible and fit-for-purpose in Australia,\u201d it said. Nathaniel Pelle, the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s business and nature lead, said the proposed definition of deforestation would be \u201clittle better than business as usual\u201d. \u201cContinuing to bulldoze native forests and woodlands and trying to label it \u2018deforestation-free\u2019 is nothing but greenwashing, plain and simple,\u201d he said. \u201cBanks and supermarkets should not buy into it.\u201d Gemma Plesman, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the proposal was a \u201ccomplete farce\u201d and \u201cnonsensical\u201d. \u201cThis is just yet another brazen attempt to deny deforestation is a problem.\u201d The World Wildlife Fund has identified Queensland, home to about 45% of Australian beef cattle, as the only global deforestation hotspot in the developed world, and says the beef industry is one of the major drivers.That claim is rejected by the beef industry.  The chief executive of Cattle Australia, Dr Chris Parker, said the consultation paper demonstrates a \u201ccommonsense approach\u201d to allow farmers access to deforestation-free markets in a way that is \u201ccognisant of our unique Australian landscape\u201d. He said the 1990 baseline was selected based on factors including data availability and historical vegetation management laws, and is open for consultation.   Related: Methane emissions: Australian cattle industry suggests shift from net zero target to \u2018climate neutral\u2019 approach    The paper takes a \u201cbalanced view\u201d of classifying land under agriculture and does not take advantage of agricultural land loopholes, Parker added. \u201cWe would much prefer to have a sensible dialogue \u2026 rather than waste time on the entirely unworkable ideologies purported by extreme groups,\u201d he said. Cattle Australia is also advocating the red meat industry drop its net zero by 2030 target in favour of a \u201cclimate neutral\u201d goal that would require far more modest reductions in methane emissions.

The last of its tiny kind \u2013 all but bullied to extinction by gambusia, an invasive fish that grows to twice the size and eight times the body mass \u2013 were a few years ago confined to a lone artesian spring in outback Queensland. \u201cIt got very, very dire,\u201d Bush Heritage Australia ecologist Dr Dean Gilligan says.      The species has since been reintroduced to 13 other shallow springs on Edgbaston reserve. The former cattle station, about 1,000km west of Brisbane, is home to 26 species that are found no where else in the world \u2013 including the red-finned blue-eye. The springs, desert safe-havens of artesian water, are protected by foot-high fences made of shade cloth which keep the gambusia out and native fish populations in. At least, that was the idea. But then a rehabilitating water table saw Edgbaston\u2019s springs more than doubled in size over the last few years, which in turn caused about a quarter of the fences to be breached by the invasive pest.    The culprit behind the burgeoning springs is a government bore capping scheme causing the Great Artesian Basin aquifers to re-emerge. Or, in other words: it was successful environmental management. \u201cIt\u2019s a poison chalice,\u201d Gilligan says. \u201cThe extra spring flow increases the size of springs that native fish and other spring fauna and flora can occupy, but it makes managing the threat much more difficult.\u201d Three years of flooding due to above average rainfall hasn\u2019t helped either, he adds.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  With water now seeping beyond the shade cloth fence lines, opportunistic crabs and yabbies have enough real estate to burrow under them. Sensing an inflow of springs, Gilligan theorises, gambusia have followed. \u201cIt\u2019s a prison escape, but they are trying to get into the prison, not out,\u201d he says.   Interactive   It\u2019s put conservation efforts on the reserve in \u201cuncharted territory\u201d, Gilligan says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much bigger those springs are going to grow.\u201d Once they infiltrate the fences, gambusia, also known as mosquitofish, cause havoc by nipping at the fins of native species and eating their eggs and larvae. The 4cm-long invaders were introduced to Australia from the US in 1929 in an effort to control mosquitoes and have since been declared a noxious pest. \u201cThey\u2019re bullies\u201d says Dr Renee Rossini, a Bush Heritage freshwater and wetlands ecologist. Without intervention, within 12 to 18 months of a breach the red-finned blue-eye will disappear. To save the compromised populations, ecologists catch and translocate surviving native fish to heated holding tanks back at camp, poison the gambusia with a few sprinkles of off-brand vegetable derris dust (a garden pesticide), reinforce the fence line, drain the spring, wait for it to refill and finally, reintroduce the native species. For a small spring that can take a few weeks. For larger interconnected pools of artesian water, it can take a year or longer.      However involved the process, Rossini says it\u2019s critical to saving a species that \u201chelps us understand how life functions, how diversity is created, how our world has changed\u201d. \u201cPlants, animals and country have all come together here to create something really, really special,\u201d she says.   Related: Rescuing a relic: battle to save the red-finned blue-eye from a modern invader    It\u2019s this value that saw Bush Heritage Australia, which bought Edgbaston in 2008, become caretakers of the fragile ecosystem to safeguard the survival of its endemic species. It\u2019s also the impetus behind a Queensland government decision on Saturday to recognise the land as special wildlife reserve. That affords it the same protections as a national park and will ban petroleum and mineral resource extraction on the reserve in perpetuity. It\u2019s the second property in the state to receive the status after legislation was introduced in 2020 to better protect private land of exceptional natural and cultural value. Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, says it\u2019s the only state in Australia to provide such a high level of protection to private property.

Less than 2km from the location of the nests is the Daisy Hill koala sanctuary and the area is popular with families, mountain bikers, horse riders and bushwalkers. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nNikki Liddell, 53, a finance manager from Alberton, discovered the nests when bushwalking. \n\u201cI never thought fire ants would have been in that area \u2013 I found them in the middle of the forest,\u201d she said. \u201cHow in the hell did they get into this area?\u201d  \nAccording to the national fire ant eradication program\u2019s map of fire ant detections, no Rifa have been detected within the Daisy Hill conservation park or the Neville Lawrie reserve in the last 12 months. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \n \nKoalas are particularly susceptible to fire ants because they move over ground and have thick fur. They were first identified as a species at threat from fire ants in a 2013 review, with the marsupials comprising one of 123 native species threatened by Rifa, Reece Pianta from the Invasive Species Council said. \nIn February koalas were for the first time identified at the federal level as being particularly vulnerable to the fire ants. In a submission by the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to the Senate inquiry into Rifa, the government warned koala, platypus and echidnas could be killed or injured by them. \nRifa were first detected in Queensland in 2001 and can kill people, native animals and livestock as well as damage infrastructure and ecosystems, and have infested more than 700,000 hectares in the Brisbane area. \nA queen ant could easily fly at least 2km to start a new nest, Pianta said, and the koala sanctuary is well within reach of the nests Liddell discovered. A possible Rifa detection inside the sanctuary was reported at the end of August but was later determined to be a coconut ant, according to the program. \nLiddell reported the nests to the fire ant suppression taskforce, which works alongside the program, but took the matter into her own hands when she had not received a response within a week. \n\u201cI got a bit cranky and said I\u2019d [bait them] myself. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if they didn\u2019t treat it for a month,\u201d she said from her Gold Coast home. \u201cThey need to be treated straight away so they don\u2019t spread more.\u201d  \nShe returned to the area a week later and treated a total of five nests with bait provided by the taskforce for use on her rural acreage. She is experienced with fire ants and is treating about 70 nests on her property. \nPianta said he found it encouraging the community wanted to help solve the problem. \n\u201cThe community are stepping up because they can see that this is an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an iconic location that was set up to keep koalas safe.\u201d \nThe purpose of the suppression zone was to keep fire ants under control, he said, and Liddell\u2019s experience suggested \u201csuppression needs to be ramped up significantly so that it works\u201d. \n\u201cPlaces that are supposed to be sanctuaries for threatened species will not be safe from fire ants unless we get them under control.\u201d \n \n  Related: What are fire ants, and what will happen if these tiny killers take hold across Australia?  \n \nBoth he and Liddell are calling for an extension of suppression efforts \u2013 including new self-baiting protocols \u2013 in the area, which will not be covered by the taskforce or the eradication program for two years from 2026. \n\u201cFor places like Daisy Hill, there is a two-year gap between the end of the suppression program and when eradication treatment will commence there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure self-baiting kits are still available over the next four years.\u201d \nA spokesperson from the program said Liddell\u2019s report had been referred to Logan city council for treatment and a decision on future funding of the taskforce had not been made. \nUnder Queensland\u2019s Biosecurity Act and pest management regulations, only authorised officers or approved persons were permitted to treat fire ants on public land, they said. \n\u201cWe do strongly encourage reporting any sightings of fire ants at a residence or on public land within 24 hours.

I can still summon the contours of my town\u2019s grief around historic road accidents, marked by an X on a rock or a telegraph pole. A time when counsellors were sent into little schools and the subsequent funerals slowed the main-street traffic to a crawl.   Related: \u2018A community like this is interlinked\u2019: how road deaths ripple through Australia\u2019s small towns    After graduation, Miller witnessed the \u201cdisturbing\u201d aftermath as an emergency doctor. Looking at that first Mad Max movie again, I was reminded of its setting on a mix of country roads much like the ones around most rural towns. There were even green paddocks in some 1970s scenes. But as the story developed, Max\u2019s world warped into a wilder dystopia. The latest instalments show Max and then the warrior woman Furiosa battling baddies out on red dirt. The cars are faster, the roads are mostly gone and the climate is hotter. We know global heating is a thing but is Furiosa also a prediction of road conditions? Regional Australians are five times more likely to die in road crashes than people in cities, according to analysis by the Australian Automobile Association. In the last few years, the road toll has surged and experts don\u2019t really know why. Last year was the worst road death toll in five years with 1,253 lives cut short in a car accident. More recent figures from the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics show 1,303 people died on Australian roads in the year to 31 May, up from 1,180 a year earlier. If you break it down state by state, you get a clearer picture of the numbers. NSW deaths are up by nearly one-third (32.9%) and road deaths in the Northern Territory are surging (72.4%), with increases in Victoria (5.1%), Queensland (5.1%), and South Australia (2.1%).   Related: Lethal highways: the Indigenous pedestrian deaths that haunt the Northern Territory    While states share the road toll figures, they do not share the crash investigation data. This has been the subject of a concerted campaign by the AAA, which has brought together safety advocates, doctors, engineers and freight operators to press governments to act. Transparent accident investigation data might show, for example, in a single car accident whether the driver fell asleep or simply hit a massive pothole and speared off into the scrub. Shared data would allow governments and the public to see the worst road toll blackspots. Did you know your local roads are given a safety rating out of five by road engineers under the Australian Road Assessment Program, funded by taxpayers? The public does not have this information across the country. Yet think back to any election when road funding promises are standard fare for rural and regional MPs. The ribbons are cut and the big cheques are handed out but our communities are still unable to see exactly why a decision to fix a road is made. Country roads are dodgy at the best of times, although all of us probably have some egregious examples of immaculate roads beautifully tarred all the way to the local power broker\u2019s driveway. Every community has a character like councillor Bill \u201cyou can\u2019t stop progress\u201d Heslop played by Bill Hunter in the film Muriel\u2019s Wedding. In the last road funding agreement, the commonwealth allocated $10bn to the states, which expired on 30 June this year. Just before the 2022 election, the transport minister, Catherine King, promised to extract better road safety data from the states and territories. Now the federal government has committed to make its road funding to states contingent on better safety data. But the deal still needs sign off from the states and while Queensland has committed, the other states are a little gun-shy. Such transparency would provide a clear picture of the dodgiest roads that might be causing ongoing carnage in our places large and small. If rising road deaths are not enough to open data vaults, states might want to think about their economies. Poor roads slow freight corridors to domestic and export markets. Regional Australia contributes about two-thirds of Australia\u2019s export earnings via industries like agriculture, tourism and resources and is home to one-third of the population. Friends recently pushed their motorbike into our driveway, having hit a big pothole on our road they did not see. So great was the jolt they lost the sump and the oil drained.

But first, they have to figure out how much of Brisbane\u2019s food is currently grown locally. The \u201cmoonshot\u201d goal will be discussed at the inaugural south-east Queensland food summit later this month. Emma-Kate Rose, the event organiser and director of the Food Connect Foundation, said the target is aimed at addressing a laundry list of systemic issues threatening the reliability of national food distribution system, including increasing extreme weather events which can cut off elongated supply lines.

Related: Antarctic blast brings damaging winds and alpine blizzards to Victoria and NSW and possible snow in Queensland    Like Sydney and Melbourne, Brisbane\u2019s peri-urban fringes contain highly productive agricultural land suitable for intensive cropping and horticulture. These regions historically produced much of the food consumed in the cities. But figuring out how much food they produce now \u2013 or where the produce ends up \u2013 is \u201cnear impossible\u201d, Rose said. \u201cThere\u2019s different numbers floating around depending on who you talk to, but we don\u2019t have that baseline,\u201d she said. Even if a baseline is determined, meeting the ambitious goal will be an uphill battle. A 2016 report by Foodprint Melbourne estimated that the Melbourne food bowl had the capacity to produce 41% of the city\u2019s total food needs. But that land is shrinking. By 2040, the report predicted, the fertile plains would produce just 18% of the city\u2019s food needs as prime agricultural land is consumed by the construction of sprawling housing estates. \u201cIt\u2019s very concerning, there\u2019s good reasons why we want to be growing food around cities in the future,\u201d the report\u2019s lead author, Dr Rachel Carey, said. Sydney is faring even worse. Another study found the farmland remaining around the city is only capable of meeting 20% of the city\u2019s overall food needs, with more losses expected if urban sprawl continues unabated. \u201cSydney is kind of where Melbourne could be heading if we don\u2019t change our policies,\u201d Carey said. Last year, a New South Wales inquiry into food production and supply found productive agricultural land in peri-urban areas was under increasing threat from development. A federal inquiry had similar findings, recommending the protection of agricultural land from urban sprawl. It recommended the government ascertain the optimal location of food distribution centres and develop a national food supply chain map to better understand the journey of food from paddock to plate.   Related: \u2018We call it our farm\u2019: meet the Australians swapping supermarket shopping for farm shares     Associate Prof Andrea Gaynor, an environmental historian from the University of Western Australia, said that while there are benefits to locally-grown food, it can still be vulnerable to supply chain shocks. \u201cI think the idea of bringing agriculture closer to the city is about making it smaller scale, adaptive and community focused agriculture,\u201d she said. \u201cThat gives children the chance to see how food can be grown, for urban wastes to be used, it can encourage circular economy type behaviours and reduce waste.\u201d Gaynor said colonial Australia had a long history of growing fruit and vegetable in or near cities, but after the second world war, those habits began to deteriorate as large-scale commercial horticulture operations were developed and cities expanded.

The report, released on Thursday, found that net greenhouse gas emissions from the red meat industry were equivalent to 31m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2021. But the emissions data was derived from the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which analysis suggests may be significantly underreporting land clearing in Queensland, making any claims based on that data \u201cnot reliable\u201d. The report said high rainfall in 2020-21 resulted in a large increase in carbon sequestration due to increased vegetation growth on land managed by the red meat sector, an area equivalent to about half of Australia\u2019s landmass.

Climate and agricultural scientists have said the target is unachievable. Julia Waite, the MLA\u2019s carbon neutral 2030 project manager, said lower rates of land clearing and greater volumes of regrowth had offset the sector\u2019s direct emissions, about 80% of which is methane released by cattle burps and manure.

One study found we may be undereporting the number of cattle by 10 million. Waite said the annual emissions report by MLA was informed by the best available science and nationally maintained data. Earlier, Waite told Guardian Australia that emissions reductions from carbon sequestration in vegetation \u201chas a shelf life\u201d because the rate of sequestration declines as forest regrowth reaches maturity. She also said net zero by 2030 \u201cisn\u2019t a static target\u201d. \u201cTo maintain an enduring net zero emissions position will require percentage reductions in direct emissions of raising livestock and energy, which will also reduce over-reliance on sequestration,\u201d Waite said.

Equipped with a \u201cgliding membrane\u201d \u2013 a loose fold of skin joining their elbows and ankles \u2013 the possum-like animal, spanning more than a metre head to tail, spends most nights gliding between trees eating gum leaves. The last confirmed sighting here, in the Deongwar state forest on the lands of the Dungibara people, was in the late 1990s. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to get confirmation that they are still here after the logging and fires,\u201d Revie says.   Interactive   Deongwar state forest contains 4,700 hectares of intact remnant native bushland and is a key wildlife corridor, connecting large tracts of nearby forest. But it\u2019s missing a \u201ckey attribute\u201d for greater glider habitat, Revie says: \u201cLarge old trees in good numbers \u2013 logging has taken all of those out.\u201d But in March the logging stopped. It was the long-planned outcome of an agreement struck in 1999 between the government, the timber industry and conservation groups. The south-east Queensland forest agreement stated that selective native timber harvesting, permitted in about 70,000 hectares of state forest in the south-east Queensland regional planning area, including Deongwar state forest, would cease at the end of 2024 \u201cby the latest\u201d.    It will take more than a century for the glider habitat to be restored. \u201cThese animals need trees at least 150 years old; when you log a forest you change it in pretty dramatic ways,\u201d says Prof David Lindenmayer from the Australian National University.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Extensive selective logging removes a large proportion of mature, hollow-bearing trees that dozens of species rely on for survival. Their absence also alters the forest\u2019s microclimate, increasing ambient temperatures and the risk of fire, Lindenmayer says. \u201cThat\u2019s bad news for greater gliders because they are very heat-sensitive animals,\u201d he says.    In the 90s greater gliders were common along Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard. Habitat fragmentation and encroachment by urban sprawl, the felling of mature hollow-bearing trees and global heating have caused their population to decline rapidly. They were listed as vulnerable in 2016 and endangered in 2022 after the 2019-20 bushfires, which burned up to 70% of their remaining habitat. \u201cWe probably lost about 50% of their population in 12 months,\u201d Revie says. Permanent protection still pending The Deongwar state forest has been recognised as potential greater glider habitat. That\u2019s the impetus behind a campaign to permanently protect the forest, led by the retired landscaper Max Fulham. Fulham visited logging sites in Deongwar when driving through the area on his way to and from his home on the Sunshine Coast. \u201cThey\u2019d cut out trees that were 110cm in diameter, I just thought, you can\u2019t walk past that,\u201d he says.    In 2022 Fulham became involved in a successful community campaign against proposed logging in Beerwah state forest. He then started his own campaign to save Deongwar.  As part of the 25-year-old forestry agreement, the Queensland government committed to transferring up to a quarter of all state forests in the region (about 20,000 hectares) to conservation areas by the end of 2024. A spokesperson from the Queensland environment department says 2,550 hectares have already been transferred and the handover of an additional 12,000 hectares will \u201csoon begin\u201d.   Related: Greater glider now endangered as logging, bushfires and global heating hit numbers    Fulham wants this transfer to include Deongwar state forest to guarantee its permanent protection and effective management. The department spokesperson told Guardian Australia the government was \u201cprogressing further additions to the conservation estate \u2026 including consideration of Deongwar state forest\u201d. The Queensland Conservation Council is advocating for the permanent protection of all 70,000 hectares of state forest in south-east Queensland. A Dungibara traditional owner, Peta May, says the logging of state forests such as Deongwar will \u201cleave a scar on the landscape for ever\u201d. \u201cWe now have the chance to move forward and begin the healing process in these protected areas,\u201d she says. Under the light of torches and red spotlights in Deongwar, Revie and Lovegrove-Walsh are still riding the high of spotting the greater glider, which they say means there are mature tree hollows in the area. \u201cThe greater speaks for many of our animals,\u201d Revie says.    But their density in the area \u2013 or rather lack of it \u2013 also speaks volumes. Walking the same distance in Nerang national park, a stronghold for the species, Lovegrove-Walsh would have seen at least half a dozen in the canopy. On Saturday night at Deongwar, they spotted one. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s only a handful left in this forest?\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few hollows here, so that\u2019s a real possibility. \u201cThese species are a key indicator of the [health of] ecosystems which we also depend on for life \u2026 for clean water and air,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the canary in the coalmine.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "\u2018We call it our farm\u2019: meet the Australians swapping supermarket shopping for farm shares  [2024-05-19T00:00:20Z]": "In a paddock by an old shed, a crowd of \u201cpassionate eaters\u201d and the odd farmer surround Randal Breen. This is Breen\u2019s farm, and crowds are part of the business model. \u201cBefore we do anything here, we ask ourselves: is it good for the animal, the land, the farmer and for the people that we feed?\u201d Breen says. He is speaking at an open day about the farm\u2019s community-supported agriculture (CSA) scheme, a model whereby farms distributes produce among their members in exchange for consistent financial support. It\u2019s this premise that has led Scott Trudgett, his family and much of the crowd on a two-hour drive west of Brisbane to visit Randal and Juanita Breen at their 263 hectare farm at Echo Valley on Queensland\u2019s Southern Downs.    Most of the food Trudgett\u2019s family of six used to eat was bought after work from a budget supermarket. Now, for a subscription and initial 12-month commitment, they receive a monthly box of meat and eggs direct from the Breen\u2019s farm. They are one of 80 families signed up to this CSA and make a few visits to the property each year. \u201cIt just made sense to get it direct from a farmer, we knew the quality, we can come and look at the farm for ourselves,\u201d Trudgett says.    It\u2019s about rebuilding that connection to the land which we\u2019ve lost  Vicky Mills, CSA member     Monthly fees range from $88 to $275, depending on the amount of produce members wish to receive. The commitment to a fixed monthly fee means the risks of farming are shared with CSA members. In the 2019 drought, just 12 cows remained on the property. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t going to feed many people,\u201d Randal says. \u201cWe were staring down the very real barrel of this all being over.\u201d But their members stepped in. At a meeting in Brisbane, they agreed to continue to pay the same monthly fee but for half the usual amount of produce. \u201cIt\u2019s a partnership,\u201d CSA member Vicky Mills says. \u201cIt\u2019s about rebuilding that connection to the land, which we\u2019ve lost.\u201d And on the farm, the land comes first. The Breens stock their chickens at a tenth of the rate required to be free-range certified and rotate their cattle herd between paddocks to allow the land enough time rest.

A vegan for more than a decade, Kim started buying meat from the farm (they sell any left-over produce after supplying their CSA members) to address a stubborn iron deficiency and mounting health issues. \u201cI loved the feeling of eating meat, and the way it improved my health, but hated the fact of what I was doing \u2013 it\u2019s a living thing and it doesn\u2019t want to die,\u201d she says. \u201cI still struggle in a way, it\u2019s a trade-off for my own health, but if this is what it takes, visiting the farm.\u201d      Dr Kiah Smith, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Policy Futures at the University of Queensland, says CSA models are providing a \u201cvalues transaction\u201d between farmers and consumers in a way commercial supply chains have failed to achieve. \u201cIt\u2019s reorganising the relationship between how food is grown, distributed and consumed, rather than seeing it as a pure market transaction,\u201d Smith says. CSA can also give small scale operations the ability to purse better environmental and animal welfare outcomes even if doing so may impact profits, she says. \u201cIt enables small farmers to grow food that they\u2019re passionate about and live in places that they care for.\u201d In Japan, where the model originated, its known as \u201cfood with the farmer\u2019s face on it\u201d. The model is slowly growing in popularity in Australia, but is largely restricted to farmers based close to large urban centres with enough demand to drum up a viable membership.   Related: Farmers skip the middlemen to get a \u2018better deal\u2019 for higher quality produce     Cost can be another barrier. Smith questions who \u201care [the] kinds of consumers that will continue to buy from alternative sources that are generally more expensive?\u201d Trudgett pays more for the 10kg of meat and 30 eggs supplied monthly by Breen\u2019s farm than he would spend at a large supermarket for comparable but lower quality produce. But Smith says the higher prices of food from alternative supply chains reflects the actual cost of producing sustainable produce that fairly compensates small-scale farmers. \u201cIts a bit like people buying electric vehicles now, they\u2019re still very expensive and not everyone can afford them, but as that kind of infrastructure improves they will become more mainstream,\u201d she says. For Trudgett, having a stake in the farm is worth the increased cost. \u201cIt\u2019s the best I could hope for living in the city, knowing exactly where our food comes from,\u201d he says. \u201cWe call it our farm.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Annastacia Palaszczuk appointed to $107,000 Australia Post board job by Labor government [2024-08-16T03:07:28Z]": "The former Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has taken a post-politics job on the board of Australia Post.

In 2022, an inquiry by the NSW parliament into the delivery of rural health services \u201crepeatedly\u201d heard of people being let down by the health system. In its report, released in May 2022, the inquiry chair, Labor MP Greg Donnelly, said the committee \u201cheard stories of emergency departments with no doctors; of patients being looked after by cooks and cleaners; of excessive wait times for treatment; and of misdiagnoses and medical errors\u201d.

The laws, which passed the European parliament in 2022 and come into effect in January 2025, will ban the import of goods produced in areas where land clearing occurs. Australian farmers have raised concerns that it could impact Australia\u2019s $143m European beef export market, which accounts for 1.3% of total beef exports. Speaking at a beef industry event in Queensland on Tuesday, the agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said he had requested the European Union commissioner delay the law\u2019s implementation.   Related: Land clearing: two million hectares of Queensland forest destroyed in five years, new analysis shows    \u201cI acknowledge that there is a lot of uncertainty and confusion within the industry about what this rule will mean for our producers going forward,\u201d he said. Other countries, including New Zealand and the US, have also raised concerns over the legislation. Later, a spokesperson for the minister said the government has requested any penalties from the law to be delayed by at least two years so its implications can be fully understood because its \u201cunclear in its meaning and application\u201d. The effect of the legislation would be most acute in Queensland, where 45% of Australia\u2019s cattle graze. The World Wildlife Fund has identified Queensland as a major part of the only global deforestation hotspot in the developed world, the majority of which is said to be driven by the beef industry. The University of Queensland adjunct senior lecturer Martin Taylor said the Australian government should be supportive of strong environmental legislation rather than attempt to delay it. A 2023 Australian Conservation Foundation report, authored by Taylor, found as few as 205 properties were responsible for half of all land-clearing that occurred in Queensland. Queensland government data found almost 350,000 hectares (865,000 acres) of woody vegetation was cleared in 2020-2021, which was a reduction on previous years. According to analysis by the Wilderness Society, about 65% of that land was cleared for livestock pastures, and, of that, more than half was regrowth vegetation more than 15 years old.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  But an official federal agricultural department briefing note to Watt in January last year, released under freedom of information laws, said \u201cthere is no risk Australian beef and leather products are connected to deforestation\u201d. Taylor described the claim as \u201cpatently false\u201d, saying \u201cbeef is the biggest single driver of deforestation in Australia\u201d. In a June 2023 letter to the European Commission, also released under FoI the federal agriculture department said it was seeking Australian exports to Europe to be assessed as \u201cdeforestation free\u201d. The spokesperson for Watt said the government was committed to stopping and reserving global forest loss and that \u201cAustralia\u2019s forest coverage is extensive and expanding\u201d. Taylor said this claim is \u201cecologically specious\u201d as it equates young regrowth saplings with the loss of mature trees. A spokesperson from Meat and Livestock Australia said the majority of land clearing is legal and occurs on a rotational basis. They said claims Australia is a deforestation hotspot are \u201cflawed\u201d. This week the MLA released an online platform developed with WWF Australia and the University of Queensland to allow producers to compile on-farm environmental data. Prof Lesley Hughes, of the Climate Council, said Australia has been \u201cone of the most prolific land clearers in the world\u201d. Hughes said the cattle industry has recognised that there is now an expectation \u201cfor farmers to be good stewards of their land, and many are, but there\u2019s still a fair way to go\u201d.   Related: Methane emissions: Australian cattle industry suggests shift from net zero target to \u2018climate neutral\u2019 approach    Dr Chris Parker, the chief executive of the peak body for grass-fed producers, Cattle Australia, said he supports the minister\u2019s request for a delay. Cattle Australia released seven draft principles for an industry standard definition of deforestation, at a presentation at Beef Week in Rockhampton on Thursday. \u201cThere is no clear definition on deforestation aligned to our Australian land management practices that supports our biodiversity,\u201d Parker said. Head of Nature at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Glenn Walker, described the move by Cattle Australia as \u201clike the fox guarding the henhouse\u201d. \u201cIt is simply not credible for the beef industry to cook up their own fantasy definition of deforestation and deny there is a problem,\u201d Walker said. Dr Megan Evans, senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales, said graziers can be \u201ccompatible with biodiversity\u201d and that a small number of producers clearing large amounts of land is negatively skewing data. \u201cRural communities will argue that it\u2019s not deforestation, it\u2019s land management, and there are grey areas,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the fact is the extent of land clearing in Queensland is still internationally significant.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Tuesday\u2019s rally for Australian farmers lists seven priorities \u2013 but the biggest two are nowhere to be seen | Gabrielle Chan [2024-09-09T15:00:19Z]": "In country circles, WhatsApp groups and emails have been pinging. As Tuesday dawns on the first rally endorsed by the National Farmers\u2019 Federation since 1985, there has been a bit of chat about its merits. The 1985 rally descended on the Hawke government. It numbered 40,000 to 45,000 people and was duplicated at some state parliaments. In Victoria, according to the journalist Martin Flanagan, 30,000 people protested, holding placards such as \u201cfarmer the new poor\u201d, \u201cAgricultural Income Deficiency Syndrome\u201d and, my personal favourite, \u201cwife home working\u201d. Like Anthony Albanese, Bob Hawke was two years into government \u2013 though Labor was already into its second term. The day the farmers marched, Hawke was holding a tax summit. He fronted the angry (but reportedly well disciplined) crowd and was met with jeers and hoots of derision. Back then, farmers were protesting against high interest rates, capital gains tax and fuel and fertiliser prices. Trade walls were tumbling, Australian businesses were increasingly exposed to competition, Medicare had begun a year earlier, and the Australian dollar had been floated in 1983, Hawke\u2019s first year of government. In 2024 the NFF has seven bones to pick with Labor. Priority issues include the 2028 phase-out of the live sheep trade, resuscitated water buybacks to meet the Murray-Darling Basin plan, increases in biosecurity charges, changes to superannuation, and community impacts from energy developments including renewable energy. Other items on the list are bogeymen: the federation opposes a call from the Greens, the Australia Institute and, interestingly, Andrew Forest to scrap the diesel fuel rebate, which Labor has already said it won\u2019t do. It also fears the 88-day visa extension, which incentivises backpackers to work in the farm industry, will be scrapped as a result of the review of regional migration settings, and \u201cunnecessary\u201d red tape from scope three emissions reporting.   Related: Farmers skip the middlemen to get a \u2018better deal\u2019 for higher quality produce     It is unclear how many people will turn up to Federation Mall but more than 1,000 people had registered to attend as of Friday, and a convoy of trucks is expected.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The NFF president, David Jochinke, told the Weekly Times it was an \u201cunusual step\u201d for the NFF to endorse the rally, which was sparked by a WA mob called Keep the Sheep.  \u201cWe just want a return to common sense. We want policies informed by farmers\u2019 lived experience and designed to grow the industry, not diminish it to appease activist agendas,\u201d Jochinke said. Back in 1985 the NFF president was Ian McLachlan, from a wealthy South Australian farming dynasty, who later went into politics proper as a minister in the Howard government. The Canberra Times journalist Jack Waterford reported it was \u201cno National party rally\u201d. In fact, the Queensland premier and National party fox, Joh Bjelke-Petersen \u2013 a man with unfulfilled federal ambitions \u2013 was begged not to speak, despite calls from the crowd. Waterford wrote: \u201c[Bjelke-Petersen] was told bluntly that the NFF would be unspeakably embarrassed: it was not a party political occasion.\u201d When McLachlan took the stage, he said the rural vote was for sale to the highest bidder, and not mortgaged to the conservative parties. \u201cAll political parties are out of touch with the rural electorate,\u201d McLachlan said. This year the Liberal and National parties have urged their conservative constituencies to get along and fly the flag. The National party has declared it is standing shoulder to shoulder with farmers. The WA Liberal senator Slade Brockman emailed supporters describing the rally as a \u201ccall to arms for Australia\u2019s agricultural industry\u201d. Brockman asks the country voter to \u201cdig deep and donate to my campaign to Defend Regional Australia\u201d with a link through to the WA Liberal party donation page.   Related: \u2018We call it our farm\u2019: meet the Australians swapping supermarket shopping for farm shares     That\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. Political parties leverage off issues of the day against their opponents and raise money off the back of it. It is about as surprising as a union campaign against the former Morrison government. These are rusted on political constituencies. But to use Jochinke\u2019s term, what is common sense in agricultural policies? This rally ostensibly began with Labor\u2019s long-held promise to phase out live export sheep by sea on 1 May 2028, a policy that largely only affects WA producers. It\u2019s a shift that is happening around the world in response to market expectations and a future Coalition government would find it hard to reintroduce live exports, particularly in their teal-leaning seats. A live export ban was signed off by the UK Conservative government earlier this year. The former Sunak government said it reinforced the country\u2019s position \u201cas a nation of animal lovers and a world leader on animal welfare\u201d. The Morrison government already limited the live sheep export trade in summer months after the Awassi Express disaster in 2017, after the then agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said footage of conditions on the ship left him \u201cshocked and gutted\u201d. Community impacts of renewable energy developments is another big issue to be raised at the rally. It is absolutely true that rural communities have had their fair share of dumb, speculative behaviour from developers and this is something Guardian Australia has covered extensively. But will rally leadership tell the crowd that energy sources are changing in the face of global heating, which remains the mother of all risks to farming? And are they really going to tell other farmers what they can and can\u2019t do on their own land, if some of them want to drought-proof their farms with solar or wind? Jochinke hosts his own wind turbines, so surely a more useful exercise when dealing with developers would be to negotiate cheap renewable power for rural communities. I understand farmers feel strongly about their industry. Hell, I wrote the book about why you should care about farming. But if I were to take to the streets, let me give you two issues that deserve more attention. First, farming is choked by some of the most anti-competitive practices in our economy, both upstream (for things such as fertiliser and other inputs) and downstream (by big processors and food retailers). That is affecting farmgate prices every day but that hasn\u2019t made the seven deadly sins. Second, the pandemic reminded us of supply chain threats to food growing. Fuel and fertiliser are mostly imported and there is no comprehensive risk assessment to agriculture. The work has been done in an excellent parliamentary report which recommends a food system plan and a minister for food. Nary a peep from Albanese\u2019s government and not a mention at the rally. Farming is a risky business made more complex by global heating. As someone who earns income from farming, \u201ccommon sense\u201d would be anticipating changing trends in the market and staying ahead of them \u2013 as many farmers are doing every day to stay in business.

It\u2019s not too hot, not too cold, and regional towns are basked in alluring shades of auburn, burgundy and orange. But to experience the season in all its glory, you have to know where to go. Autumn colours are more pronounced in cooler locations. Milder temperatures, cold nights and higher rainfall are the necessary conditions for the deciduous trees that make the most stunning displays: elms, poplars and maples are the most commonly seen in Australia\u2019s tree-lined avenues.

As the chlorophyll breaks down and the greens start to disappear, these trees become cloaked in bright, sunshine hues, attracting tourists from near and far. Here are five spots to catch a glimpse of the best autumn colours before winter proper sets in. Wentworth Falls, Blue Mountains, NSW    They may be called the Blue Mountains, but during autumn the trees glitter like gold. While there are many towns in the mountains putting on a display, the village of Wentworth Falls is particularly beautiful. Set your self up next to the Wentworth Falls Lake, which provides an idyllic backdrop for an afternoon picnic and some fresh mountain air, and enjoy the flaming-red maple trees and cascading leaves through the Sinclair Crescent tunnel of trees. Grant Crescent, Canberra, ACT    It\u2019s dubbed Canberra\u2019s prettiest street, and for good reason. While the capital city is renowned for its lush autumn streetscapes, Grant Crescent is top of the list for those seeking a decent spot for a quick snap for social media. Grab yourself a coffee and take a leisurely drive or stroll through the avenue of towering American elm trees as you admire the vivid display. Macedon, Macedon Ranges, Victoria    While Victoria is home to several towns boasting abundant autumn foliage, Macedon is often the first port of call for travellers from Melbourne. Located at the foot of Mount Macedon, just 50 minutes from the Melbourne CBD, the town\u2019s Avenue of Honour is lined with 154 pin oak trees with branches stretching across the road to make a leafy cathedral. Mount Macedon is also home to a number of open gardens, including Forest Glade, where maples, birches and beeches abound. Toowoomba, Queensland    Queensland may be the sunshine state, but the regional city of Toowoomba, two hours inland of Brisbane, has a cooler climate. Known as the Garden City, Toowoomba sits high on the edge of a plateau, creating the necessary conditions to put on a vivid show in autumn and even boasts its own autumn leaf trail. Toowoomba also has Japanese gardens, bushlands, forest walks and parklands. Walhalla, Gippsland, Victoria    Once one of Victoria\u2019s richest towns, the historic village of Walhalla is known for its heritage charm. Once home to 4,000 people seeking their fortune in the gold rush, there are now just 20 permanent residents. Just 2.5 hours from Melbourne, the village is heavily planted with deciduous trees which put on a display every autumn. For the best, visit the town\u2019s landmark rotunda, and revel in the natural surroundings and sweeping hills.

A few hundred metres after that is another. \u201cKeep playing trivia\u201d it reads. \u201cIt may save your life!\u201d That\u2019s the theory behind dozens of trivia signs found along five major highways in Queensland. It\u2019s hoped they will improve driver alertness on long journeys across the state, which is more than seven times the size of the UK. Queensland truck driver, David Thompson, has seen them all. \u201cIt\u2019s the roadside version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no prize money but it might keep you awake, and alive. That\u2019s worth more than a million dollars.\u201d    The signs can also teach Queenslanders a few things in the process, Thompson says. \u201cA lot of that stuff is missed in school nowadays. Any education is better than no education.\u201d Daryl Dickenson, a Brisbane truck driver, knows all the answers too. \u201cEven if we have seen the answers a hundred times they are something to look at and a tool to fight fatigue,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I wish they\u2019d change them a bit more often.\u201d Every question and answer is stuck to an aluminium panel and secured with a padlock. This means they can be swapped out for fresh questions.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Heading north on the New England Highway, about an hour after crossing the New South Wales and Queensland border, Woolley hits an area dubbed the \u201cfatigue zone\u201d. The trivia begins: \u201cWhen is rabbit breeding season?\u201d    A few years ago that sign asked passing drivers about which animal is the fastest on earth, Woolley says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a trick question because the peregrine falcon is only fastest when it dive bombs to catch prey,\u201d he says. In flight, the peregrine can reach speeds of more than 320km an hour. Prof Narelle Haworth from the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety Queensland says roadside trivia is a low-cost fatigue countermeasure designed to break up the monotony of driving long distances. She says this aim is \u201cin agreement\u201d with road safety research but no study has specifically analysed the impact of roadside trivia. \u201cDoing the same boring thing without much stimulation leads to losing alertness,\u201d she says. \u201cThe idea of roadside trivia is to make drivers more alert \u2026 maybe a passenger starts up a conversation who knows the answer.\u201d   Related: Regional Australians five times more likely to die in car accidents: report    It requires an analogue approach. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to think drivers are using their mobile phones to look up the answer as they drive along,\u201d Haworth says.  Queensland Transport and Main Roads (TMR) say trivia signs have been installed on the state\u2019s highways since 2012 to \u201chelp drivers remain alert by keeping their mind active\u201d with questions rotated at \u201cvarying intervals\u201d. Fatigue and distraction contributed to 10% of Queensland\u2019s 265 road deaths in 2023, a TMR report says. Dani Logan lives in Warwick, a town a few hours west of Brisbane. She says the trivia questions should be changed every few months, instead of waiting years for new material. \u201cFor locals it gets boring pretty quick,\u201d Logan says. \u201cI think electronic signs could be a good idea, easier to change the questions.\u201d Haworth says losing focus when driving for long periods is an internationally recognised problem. \u201cBut in Australia, we seem to be pretty well up there in boring stretches of roads,\u201d she says. \u201cTrivia signs seem to have got the public\u2019s attention, literally.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "If regional communities don\u2019t want a windfarm, why would they accept a nuclear power station? | Gabrielle Chan [2024-06-03T15:00:46Z]": "Here\u2019s the thing about the Coalition\u2019s latest nuclear policy. It tries to use one of the most contentious issues in rural areas, which is the rollout of renewables and the electricity transmission lines to carry energy around the country, to push an even more controversial energy transition. Because nuclear power stations would also be built in the regions. And if you\u2019re worried about renewables, hands up who wants a nuclear reactor next door? My generation grew up with the US-Russian cold war and the Doomsday Clock. While the conversation and the technology of nuclear energy has moved on, the cost, complexity and construction time has not, as the CSIRO found in a report released last month.   Related: CSIRO stands by nuclear power costings that contradict Coalition claims    Polling shows support has been steadily rising for the general concept of nuclear power. But I wouldn\u2019t be putting money there being less opposition to nuclear facilities than renewable facilities in regional places. If there is one thing that I have learned from calling a country town home, it is that people are very attached to their place and how it is identified. Not everyone opposes renewables but there is a significant portion of people who don\u2019t want them in their own back yard. Others are quietly making their fortunes, having struck the formula for drought-proofing their businesses for decades to come. If the Big Dry strikes, you will probably find them on a beach somewhere. That is because annual payments to host turbines start from $40,000 each though I know of agreements that are much higher, especially when communities collectively bargain. The New South Wales government pays landowners $200,000 to host transmission lines in annual instalments over 20 years, with Victoria paying the same over 25 years. Those payments have crept up because of ongoing regional protests. That action has been amplified by poor community consultation from some energy companies highlighted in the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner Andrew Dyer\u2019s report. He found the rollout had created \u201cmaterial distrust\u201d of developers in some communities.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Discontent is also being amplified for political purposes, including by David Littleproud, Barnaby Joyce and Matt Canavan, who spoke at a rally against renewables at parliament house. The politics is clear. For starters, the long lead time kicks the nuclear energy can down the road to 2040. The Liberals cannot walk naked into the next election without at least a fig leaf for a net zero policy. The Nationals, on the other hand, don\u2019t give a toss about net zero. They just want to extract the funding from the Liberals in compensation for hosting any technology that delivers on the net zero promise. Nuclear can be that fig leaf. It is also true the Nats and the country Liberals will have to wear any pushback on where nuclear facilities are placed. They won\u2019t be able to campaign against their own policy like some do on renewables. Peter Dutton has not, as yet, specifically named any potential sites for a nuclear power station but he has pointed to current coal production facilities that are due to close. His announcement is imminent, perhaps even after the party room meeting on Tuesday. Possible sites include the Hunter Valley in NSW; Anglesea and Latrobe Valley in Victoria; Port Augusta in South Australia; Collie in Western Australia; and perhaps Tarong in central Queensland \u2013 within Littleproud\u2019s Maranoa electorate. Since then the game has begun to get Coalition MPs to commit to host or rule out a reactor in their own back yard. This is a bit silly really, because apart from the ACT, which renewable-supporting metropolitan MPs could commit to hosting a wind turbine or a solar farm in their city seats?   Related: Voter views on animal welfare are changing \u2013 and taking the live sheep export trade with them | Gabrielle Chan    Littleproud and Joyce have both indicated their approval to host a reactor. But a dozen others would not commit when asked by Nine newspapers. Keith Pitt told Nine he supported lifting the moratorium on nuclear power but, alas, there were technical restrictions, including earthquakes in his electorate. But if Pitt is worried about his area, other MPs might be scurrying to the Geoscience Australia map of faultlines for their own get-out-of-jail-free card. Pitt\u2019s seat of Hinkler looks like a shoo-in compared to the faultlines under Darren Chester\u2019s Gippsland electorate, which covers the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, or the Liberal MP Rick Wilson\u2019s seat of O\u2019Connor, which covers Collie in WA. A Geoscience Australia geologist, Dr Tamarah King, said the earthquake hazard in Australia was generally low but damaging earthquakes were possible across the country and have occurred in the past. \u201cWhile most earthquakes in Australia are small in magnitude and don\u2019t cause significant damage, they tend to be shallow (less than 10km depth) and shaking is felt over very large distances,\u201d King said. \u201cSeismic hazards can be avoided and/or engineered for in both coal and nuclear power plant facilities.\u201d Down in Wannon, an electorate that stretches from Anglesea to the South Australian border, the Liberal MP Dan Tehan said Anglesea wouldn\u2019t be hosting nuclear, thanks very much. He said the \u201cEden project\u201d was designed to rehabilitate the mine site there, which according to its website will \u201ccelebrate the local ecology and tell you the story of sustainability\u201d. That development also tells you everything you need to know about how the demographic is changing in Tehan\u2019s electorate, flush with sea-changers escaping the cities. Those newcomers will continue to change voting patterns in a marginal seat, chipped away over three elections by the independent candidate and the former Triple J host Alex Dyson. And really, that is the point. The existing coal-fired power stations are close to populations and transmission lines but those communities are changing rapidly. And that\u2019s changing the voter base. We used to lament our kids leaving country towns. Now they are coming back and bringing their friends. Millennials, under 40, are leading the charge on the hunt for affordable places with better lifestyles. Regional demographic change is no longer a pandemic blip. The latest analysis from the Regional Movers Index, shows regional migration hit a 12-month high, as 24% more people moved from city to bush rather than the other way around. \u201cThis movement in population can no longer be seen as a quirky flow-on effect from the lockdown years,\u201d said the Regional Australia Institute chief executive, Liz Ritchie. \u201cA societal shift is under way,\u201d Once you combine the feelings of the existing populations with younger populations, does that add up to support for nuclear over renewables in these changing back yards?

He suspects the culprits must return from holidays to a broken fridge and bad smell. Instead of paying $12 to drop it off at the local tip, they dump the whole lot on the quiet backroad. Monaghan, who styles himself as the \u201cWarwick Rubbish Rambler\u201d, has gathered 104 tonnes of rubbish from roadsides around the rural town in the past 15 years. Other standout finds include dozens of mobile phones of which six were returned to their owners, a sex swing, a sealed 24-pack of deodorant cans and a plastic bag full of pornographic DVDs. \u201cSt Vincent\u2019s [charity shop] doesn\u2019t have an X-rated section, at least not that I know of, so the DVDs went in the bin,\u201d he says.

He targets this stretch of road, which is surrounded by long grass and scrub, one day a month. \u201cI guess you can say I\u2019m a bit obsessed,\u201d he says. \u201cObsession isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing I think, if it gives you a good purpose.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  His rubbish collecting began in 2007 as a daily morning walk, after years of illness. He was aiming to get fit and picked up rubbish along the way. A year later he\u2019d collected one tonne of rubbish. Early on he experimented with using a postie bike \u2013 the low-powered motorcycles favoured by Australia Post \u2013 to speed up rubbish collection. That \u201cfun but impractical and inherently dangerous\u201d approach lasted a few years, until he collided with a dead kangaroo.    He now favours a custom-built trolley, which rolls out of the back of a large navy-blue van. This setup has taken his rubbish rambling \u201cto a whole new level\u201d. His latest personal milestone, 104 tonnes of rubbish collected since 2008, passed on Saturday. By 2032 he hopes to crack 200 tonnes, which will mean collecting 30kg of trash a day for the next eight years.

It weighs in at just 13kg. \u201cWell below my target,\u201d he says. Cans and bottles are taken to drop-off points for the 10c refund and car batteries are sold to a local metal dealer for 50c/kg.

He received a citizen award in 2018. \u201cI think they wanted to give me another award so they had to make one up,\u201d Monaghan says. \u201cIn what way am I cultural? \u201cIt\u2019s good to be recognised, but it means more to me when people toot the horn on the way past, wave, or give out one of those \u2018Gooodoonnyaaas\u2019, especially when it\u2019s raining.\u201d    Southern Downs council has employed an illegal dumping officer since July. Nicole Collett, the council\u2019s manager of environmental services, says 574 wheelie bins worth of illegally dumped rubbish have been recorded in the past seven months. Dropping household rubbish at the tip is free, Collett says, but \u201ca lot of the time people leave a rental and then dump all their furniture on the side of the road\u201d.  Due to recycling costs, residents are charged a small fee to dispose of car tyres, fridges and mattresses. Monaghan doesn\u2019t bother collecting those items. He often walks past more than a dozen tyres a day, and says a refund system should apply to used car tyres like it does to bottles and cans. \u201cQueensland University [of Technology] is looking at turning them into diesel,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not economical I guess. There\u2019s no incentive.\u201d    He\u2019s also noticed an uptick in the number of mattresses dumped on roadsides since the tip introduced the $15 mattress disposal charge last year.

There are also options for people with disabilities to take part. \u201cThat makes it very, very welcoming for a lot of people,\u201dDeaman says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a really good sport to build a bond and strong line of communication with your horse.\u201d Robertson agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not cliquey or judgy,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a lot of horse sports you have to have the right gear and the right horse, where as in archery you can ride on any horse with any gear as long you\u2019re safe.\u201d The rise of medieval festivals and events in Australia and their growing popularity on social media is also contributing to greater interest. In September Deaman travelled to the world horse archery championships in Mongolia. \u201cWe did everything through social media, all of our fundraising, all of our publications and publicity \u2026 we had a really massive response,\u201d she says. But, as a small sport on a large continent, many competitors have to travel long distances to find their nearest event. Riders who can\u2019t bring their own horses are catch-riding, competing on a horse they\u2019ve never ridden before.  \u201cThe Queensland teams are probably travelling somewhere close to 20 hours all up,\u201d Deaman says. \u201cThat certainly can be stressful for the horses \u2013 it\u2019s a big commitment to make.\u201d As the competition approaches, Robertson is making preparations for the two-day journey so it\u2019s as comfortable as possible for Chiko, 15, while cramming in a bit more practice. \u201cI\u2019ll just let my horse do what I\u2019ve taught him to do and let off arrows as quick as I bloody can,\u201d she says.

So why don\u2019t we do it more?  [2024-06-12T15:00:07Z]": "As a flock of about 2,000 sheep graze between rows of solar panels, grazier Tony Inder wonders what all the fuss is about. \u201cI\u2019m not going to suggest it\u2019s everyone\u2019s cup of tea,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as far as sheep grazing goes, solar is really good.\u201d Inder is talking about concerns over the encroachment of prime agricultural land by ever-expanding solar and windfarms, a well-trodden talking point for the loudest opponents to Australia\u2019s energy transition. But on Inder\u2019s New South Wales property, a solar farm has increased wool production. It is a symbiotic relationship that the director of the National Renewables in Agriculture Conference, Karin Stark, wants to see replicated across as many solar farms as possible as Australia\u2019s energy grid transitions away from fossil fuels. \u201cIt\u2019s all about farm diversification,\u201d Stark says. \u201cAt the moment a lot of us farmers are reliant on when it\u2019s going to rain, having solar and wind provides this secondary income.\u201d    By keeping the grass trimmed, which can otherwise pose a fire risk during dry summer months, sheep save the developer the cost of slashing it themselves. In exchange, the panels provide shelter for the sheep, encourage healthier pasture growth under the shade of the panels and create \u201cdrip lines\u201d from condensation rolling off the face of the panels. \u201cWe had strips of green grass right through the drought,\u201d Dubbo sheep grazier Tom Warren says. Warren has seen a 15% rise in wool production due to a solar farm installed on his property more than seven years ago. Despite these success stories, a 2023 Agrivoltaic Resource Centre report authored by Stark found that solar grazing is under utilised in Australia because developers, despite saying they intend to host livestock, make few planning adjustments to ensure that happens. \u201cThe result is that many solar farms are poorly suited for sheep,\u201d Stark says. \u201cDevelopers need to be talking to landholders earlier than they currently are.\u201d  Prof Bernadette McCabe, the director of the Centre for Agricultural Engineering at the University of Southern Queensland, says farming and solar are \u201ctwo very different activities\u201d and there\u2019s \u201cminimal research and demonstrated success\u201d of running them in combination.   Related: First lockdown, then the voice, now renewables? Anti-government groups find new energy in environment battles     The expectation to retain farming land for primary production is driving greater interest in the coexistence of agriculture and renewable energy but McCabe says \u201cmisaligned incentives\u201d between the developers and farmers must be better managed.  It\u2019s these conflicting goals that are giving anti-renewable voices \u201cfodder to attack the renewable energy industry\u201d, according to former New South Wales solar developer Ben Wynn. He says energy developers often \u201ctalk up the possibility\u201d of coexisting with livestock production but don\u2019t have \u201cgenuine desire to do so\u201d. Wynn is now part of a community group opposing a large solar farm proposed south of Tamworth because it lies on productive cropping country. \u201cWe need this transition to speed up, but if we take up highly arable black soils we are giving oxygen to the naysayers,\u201d he says. Wynn also led the construction of a prototype solar farm outside Tamworth, raised high off the ground with steel posts to stay out of reach of a cattle herd below. \u201cCattle are massive, they will rub and scratch themselves up against anything,\u201d Wynn says.    The project was a success but Wynn says it is too expensive to be feasible on a large scale because the installation costs are three-to-four fold the cost of regular low-lying solar panels. The integration of sheep and solar is \u201chighly feasible\u201d, McCabe says, because they can graze under ordinary height panels. But she says it is \u201cstill early days\u201d to know if it will become economically viable for cattle. Dr Nicholas Aberle, the energy generation and storage policy director at the Clean Energy Council, says solar developers should explore dual land use options but warns it be may not be suitable for every project. He adds that \u201cthe abundance of land in Australia means it isn\u2019t always necessary\u201d.   Related: Gina Rinehart says renewable energy could use one-third of Australia\u2019s prime agricultural land. Is she right?    According to an analysis by the Clean Energy Council, less than 0.027% of land used for agriculture production would be needed to power the east coast states with solar projects \u2013 far less than the one-third of all prime agricultural land that the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs has claimed will be \u201ctaken over\u201d by renewables. That argument, which has been heavily refuted by experts, has been taken up by the National party, whose leader, David Littleproud, said regional Australia had reached saturation point with renewable energy developments.

The research, commissioned by Greenpeace and conducted by the University of Queensland academic Martin Taylor, found almost all land clearing that occurred in the state between 2016 and 2021 was in areas where threatened species habitat was \u201clikely to occur\u201d. Almost two-thirds of the cleared area, or 1.3m hectares, was marked by the Queensland government as \u201ccategory x\u201d, meaning it was exempt from state vegetation laws that regulate land clearing. Some 500,000 hectares of that land was koala habitat, the report said.   Related: New Australian environment laws would not stop widespread deforestation, organisations say    Taylor, an adjunct professor at the University of Queensland and former WWF-Australia conservation scientist, conducted the analysis by comparing state government land clearing data to federally mapped areas of environmental significance. The majority of recorded land clearing occurred in regrowth forest that was more than 15 years old, which Taylor said made it capable of providing rich habitat for native animals.

Gemma Plesman, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said the report documented deforestation on a \u201cfrightening\u201d scale. She said the state\u2019s annual statewide land cover and tree study (Slats) shows land clearing was driven by beef production. According to the beef industry, more than 10m cattle graze on Queensland pastures, making it the biggest beef producing state in the country. \u201cFast food chains and retailers should be aware that the beef they are selling could come from properties that have bulldozed koala habitat with no government oversight,\u201d Plesman said. Plesman said environmental law reforms being developed by the federal government needed to address concerns around deforestation in Queensland to be effective. \u201cThis shocking data should be a wake-up call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey must address what has made Australia a global hotspot for deforestation.\u201d The Wilderness Society Queensland campaign manager, Hannah Schuch, said deforestation in Queensland was driving biodiversity loss. \u201cIt\u2019s having an impact on iconic native species like the koala, the greater glider, the red goshawk, it\u2019s tearing down their homes and pushing them towards extinction,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that erosion and sediment runoff from deforestation is another threat to the already at-risk Great Barrier Reef,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the government was in the consultation process to develop new national environment laws. However, three organisations familiar with the draft laws say they would continue to allow widespread deforestation. Michael Guerin, the chief executive of Queensland farming body AgForce, questioned the accuracy of the Slats data which was used in Taylor\u2019s analysis.

Within a few months, there will be 162; within a decade, with another gigantic project proposed next door, about 350. \nAnd that\u2019s just to the north. In every other direction, Finlay says with a sweep of his hand, wind developers are knocking on farmers\u2019 doors. \n\u201cPeople either like wind turbines or they don\u2019t like them. It\u2019s quite polarising,\u201d says Finlay, once president of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation and now chair of the government\u2019s centrepiece drought policy, the Future Drought Fund. He says the view \u201cdoesn\u2019t really worry me\u201d. \nAt least 30 turbines are located on Finlay\u2019s land. For him and the nine other landowners hosting the MacIntyre windfarm, it is a financial lifeline. \nThe project is the largest onshore windfarm in the southern hemisphere and covers about 36,000 hectares of rocky grazing country south of the rural town of Karara, about 200km south-west of Brisbane. Five years ago it suffered its worst drought in living memory. \n\u201cIncome diversification is critical for long-term survival in Australian agriculture,\u201d Finlay says. \u201cWhat we hear in the predictions are larger droughts, longer droughts, deeper droughts into the future.\u201d \nGovernments may have their sights on renewable energy \u2013 critical for reducing reliance on fossil fuels in order to curb the worst of global heating \u2013 but for farmers, it\u2019s more about surviving it at all. \nThe deal struck by the group of landowners and the windfarm\u2019s developer, Spanish renewable energy giant Acciona, is confidential, but lobby group Farmers for Climate Action has said annual payments to farmers average $40,000 a turbine. \nThat estimate would put total compensation, shared between the 10 landowners, at $162m over the project\u2019s 25-year lease agreement. It is a potentially significant additional income alongside earnings from their wool and meat operations that can coexist with turbines humming overhead. \nFinlay calls himself a \u201crenewable energy farmer\u201d, but not everyone is convinced. \nWhat about the neighbours? \n\u201cEveryone over there has got turbines and I don\u2019t begrudge that,\u201d says grazier Scott Tait. \nTait runs cattle on a property at Karara but lives outside the area. \u201cIf we were offered the opportunity to host turbines I suppose we\u2019d take it too,\u201d he says. \nFrom a hill on his property, which Tait says he planned to build a house on, the blades of half a dozen MacIntyre turbines poke above a distant stand of eucalypts. Tait says Acciona representatives assured him the turbines wouldn\u2019t be visible from his house site. \nThe new development on Acciona\u2019s books, Herries Range, will see turbines built in the other direction. The rapidly expanding landscape of steel towers and fibreglass blades that stretch 285m into the sky has left Tait saying he feels powerless. And unlike his neighbours who host turbines, he had not received any compensation. \n \n Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \n \nIt is this group of people \u2013 neighbours, not hosts \u2013 who are showing a growing resentment toward the renewable energy boom. French energy company Engie this week announced a plan to offer a $1,000 rebate on energy bills to those who live near its solar and wind developments in an effort to build support. \n\u201cIf this is the way we have to go, if this is the future, there needs to be a better system of taking into account the impact on small rural communities,\u201d Tait says. \nIn a statement, an Acciona spokesperson said Tait\u2019s land is more than 5km from the nearest turbine and the company will continue to engage with him about his concerns while \u201cdiscussing potential impact and mitigation\u201d. \nMitigating the impact on rural communities is a concern in renewable energy developments across the country, says former national energy infrastructure commissioner Andrew Dyer. Neighbour agreements \u2013 compensation for landowners who don\u2019t host turbines themselves but are close to properties that do \u2013 can allay concerns. \n\u201cIt means neighbours can then be part of the winning team rather than the losing team,\u201d Dyer tells Guardian Australia. \nA review authored by Dyer found Australia\u2019s renewable energy rollout had created a \u201cmaterial distrust\u201d of energy developers due to a lack of community engagement. The government has committed $20.7m to implementing its recommendations. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s the fear of the unknown that often drives tension and concern, that\u2019s fair enough, we\u2019d all be concerned,\u201d Dyer says. Decreases in the land value of neighbouring properties is another major concern, but there is \u201climited to no evidence\u201d this eventuates, he says. \nDown the road from the windfarm, Elizabeth and Andrew Galeraith are renovating the Karara taven &amp; motel which they bought last month. The roadside pub\u2019s revenue has tripled since construction began. \n\u201cIf you want the area to grow and develop, then MacIntyre has been really positive,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cIf you want it to stay as a small rural community, then it\u2019s not. It depends on your values \u2026 we want it to thrive.\u201d \nA new battleground \nTwo weeks ago, about 50 people gathered into a community centre in Greymare, Queensland in opposition to a prospective windfarm in the area. Among the crowd were state Liberal MP James Lister, who took their concerns to parliament. \nUnlike the vast land holdings that host the MacIntyre windfarm, Greymare is dotted with retirees and tree-changers on small hobby farms.  \nThe meeting was organised by Rose Uwins and Lindy Bennett, who moved to the area from Melbourne. \u201cWe have not had one iota of consultation, we have not been able to have a say, we have not been able to have an opinion,\u201d Bennett says. \nIt\u2019s not the only community with concerns: last week the South Burnett regional council unanimously called for a moratorium on renewable energy projects until strict conditions are met. \nOpposition to renewable developments ranges from the lack of consultation and the visual impact to the localised environmental impacts, increases in traffic and increased pressure on an already stretched rental market. \nMacIntyre\u2019s construction workforce peaked at about 750 last year. The majority lived in an on-site workers\u2019 camp, but some lived in the nearby town of Warwick in the Southern Downs regional council. The mayor, Melissa Hamilton, says it has had an impact on housing availability. \n\u201cA lot of families who could afford rent before have found themselves homeless,\u201d she says. \nWind developers are required to pay rates to local councils of roughly $10,000 per turbine. According to Acciona, the MacIntyre project has so far poured $678m into Queensland businesses, will employ up to 40 people and distribute $250,000 in community grants annually once operational and is supported by 58% of locals. The company said they could \u201clearn from\u201d the housing issue.  \nAt Greymare, some locals who have watched the MacIntyre development are arguing in support of the economic benefit of hosting a windfarm in their community, too. \nFrom a ridge on David Lawler\u2019s Greymare property, the silhouettes of MacIntyre\u2019s wind turbines pierce the horizon like matchsticks. Lawler is one of about 25 farmers in early talks with a renewable energy developer. \nHosting turbines would make for a comfortable retirement for Lawler, a secure income for his two sons and potential local jobs. \n\u201cNot everyone wants their kids to have to go away and work,\u201d Lawler says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think of the benefit to the whole community.\u201d \n \n Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter \n Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community \n", "In rural Australia, everyone knows your business \u2013 so it's harder for victims of violence to get help | Gabrielle Chan [2024-05-06T15:00:42Z]": "People often dream of small town life. It\u2019s the idea of belonging, I think. My local supermarket, my post office, my bank and my chemist are in the same block. My newsagent is also my cafe. Every time I go to town, people can see where I go and who I meet. Life is conducted in a goldfish bowl. Yet for some people it is possible to drown in plain sight. Social networks are tight and, while gossip is rife, no one actually tells you what people are saying about you. People don\u2019t want to pry or cross personal boundaries. It\u2019s hard to access services without others finding out. Someone you know always works at the doctor\u2019s surgery or the hospital or the baby health clinic or the bank or with the lawyer or the accountant. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that living in such a community with an abusive partner could be a trap. So it was something of a relief to hear the Forbes mayor, Phyllis Miller, cut to the chase. As the hand-wringing continued in this latest national WTF moment in the war against women, Miller described the added problem for rural women.   Related: As regional Australia reels from several women\u2019s deaths, advocates seek both policing and prevention    \u201cIt is not safe for women to live in rural and regional New South Wales. We are not safe. We cannot hide like you can in the metropolitan areas. Everybody knows everyone and they know where everyone is. So we are not safe,\u201d she told ABC Breakfast. It is a fact that living rurally increases the risk of intimate partner violence for women. Services are more sparse. Distance from family and friends is greater. Economic capacity is often lower. All of the elements that create greater hurdles in other life services such as health, education, childcare, government support and transport in turn make domestic violence protection and support more challenging.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  And while nobody talks about it much, there are cultural differences that make rural incidents volatile, more deadly and in some ways more pervasive. Dr Freya McLachlan is a research fellow at the Centre of Excellence for The Elimination of Violence Against Women at Griffith University. She grew up in a small town in Queensland and has completed her PhD on intimate partner femicide, publishing some of the findings in The Rurality of Intimate Partner Femicide: Examining Risk Factors In Queensland. McLachlan examined finalised and closed cases of homicide perpetrated by a male offender towards a female victim, by a partner or ex-partner in Queensland rural areas between 2006 and 2019. There happened to be exactly 100 cases that fit that criteria, though she says the true rate is likely greater. She found a higher incidence in rural areas even though associated risk factors are similar between urban and rural cases. Those factors include previous violence against intimate partners, stalking, pending or actual separation, ownership of lethal weapons, substance use and mental illness. There are a number of common rural themes \u2013 isolation, male bush culture and greater access to guns \u2013 that point to the need for unique solutions for the regions.   Related: Molly Ticehurst: review ordered into bail laws and court decisions made before Forbes woman\u2019s alleged murder    The isolation provided by greater space and distance provides cover. In country towns, McLachlan found perpetrators were less likely to bother hiding their actions. It means violence can be more severe and continue for longer without intervention. Conversely, the goldfish bowl effect of small town living makes it easier to see if a woman is accessing domestic violence support services and that information can easily get back to the abuser. That increases the fear of seeking help. Another key factor is the very male culture of the bush, long celebrated and interrogated in Australian history, myth and legend. While metropolitan culture may have shifted somewhat under the weight of diversity, the bush remains a very male place. \u201cA common finding in this research is that those living in rural areas are more likely to be tolerant of [intimate partner violence] due to values based on patriarchal thinking, such as victim blaming and expectations of women adhering to traditional gender roles,\u201d McLachlan writes. Essentially, there is greater pressure to fulfil the roles of wife and mother \u201cover individual agency\u201d. In conjunction with cultural expectations, limited employment opportunities exacerbated by lack of childcare increase the economic dependence on partners, including abusive ones. McLachlan uses the example of farms being handed down along male lines. \u201cThat results in women being really reliant on male partners because they don\u2019t have financial independence, they might not even own their own land or they may be living on the partner\u2019s land so it\u2019s really difficult for them to separate,\u201d McLachlan says. While Australians are rightly proud of their gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre, McLachlan found a statistically significant increase in women who die from gunshot wounds in rural areas compared with cities. It was the second highest cause of death behind sharp object wounds. Even when guns are not used, McLachlan says the ownership of guns can amplify coercive control that may stop women from speaking up or leaving. Finally, while there has been a lot of research from rural areas in the US and elsewhere, McLachlan\u2019s Queensland review has not been replicated in other states. We simply don\u2019t know what is happening elsewhere in the country because, McLachlan says, the data is incomplete. \u201cWe do know there is more missing data in rural areas than urban areas,\u201d she says. In the lead-up to Mother\u2019s Day in 2015, I wrote about the case of another regional woman, Miss Hart, who died on Anzac Day. She had a three-year-old child. At that time too the women of Brewarrina were angry and marched past the pubs and laid a wreath for the victim. The same year, coroner Michael Barnes found farmer Geoffrey Francis Hunt shot his wife, Kim, and three children dead before taking his own life in the farm dam near Lockhart. Domestic violence is a national issue that crosses geographic, demographic, racial and class boundaries. But, as is often the case, rural communities need particular solutions to deal with the challenges McLachlan and others have raised. Frontline funding, access to training and stricter gun control for known violent perpetrators is a good start.

Back then, carrying on a working life meant making the 90-minute commute in the dark twice a day, while hoping not to meet a kangaroo on a similar path. When the second child arrived, after a short stint working part-time, I threw up my hands and stayed at home. The internet was barely a thing. Working from home was still considered deeply suspicious by employers. For me and many other rural mothers (and it is still mostly mothers), the combination of distance and lack of available childcare increased the difficulty of returning to work to such a degree that it was not worth it. We could afford to make the choice, though my superannuation has suffered. Jobs are more mobile now and childcare is better recognised in 2024 as an actual economic good, but I am not sure it is any easier.   Related: Australian farmland prices have doubled in the past decade. Is it time to put the \u2018poor farmer\u2019 narrative to bed? | Gabrielle Chan    Work by the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University in 2022 found nearly half (44.6%) of those in regional areas live in so-called childcare deserts and that nearly doubles (85.3%) for those in remote Australia. This year the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report into childcare services concluded that markets were not delivering on key policy objectives for all households and communities. Childcare is often not accessible or affordable. The thing about living in a small town is that the size and population strips back the white noise of the city. If a local nurse can\u2019t get childcare, you can see your one hospital missing out and directly link the two. If a teacher cannot get childcare, you see your one school missing out, and you know that school will probably have to wait until her own children have reached school age to get that teacher back.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  It is a truth universally acknowledged that rural services are harder and generally more expensive to provide. Like our hospitals, schools, aged care and allied health professional services, rural childcare suffers from lack of attention partly because the demand is simply not as high as in metropolitan centres. That means for-profit businesses are generally not interested. Or in the words of the ACCC interim report, \u201cfor-profit providers are less likely to operate in more disadvantaged areas, and more likely to operate in major cities which are also more advantaged. Accordingly, there is likely to be greater availability for children under the age of two in these areas\u201d. Sometimes small places don\u2019t know the qualifications hiding in their midst because people are not able to work. This will be amplified since the great regional migration from cities, particularly among under-40s, in the pandemic years. If you combine burgeoning regional skills with the big long-term workforce trends, things get even more interesting. Do you know what the biggest industries in regional Australia are? Not mining, not farming but healthcare and social services, retail, education services and construction. Apart from construction, all of those industries are dominated by women, even more so in country towns. We also know women are now more educated than men and female professionals replaced male tradesmen as the largest group of workers by occupation in 2015. Women dominate many of the service industries in country towns that are crying out for a workforce. Look through the government\u2019s workforce figures for rural and regional areas and you will see the dominance of women in our biggest service industries. Outback Queensland, for example, had 4,100 women employed in health and social services compared with 800 men in February this year. Women dominate professional and technical services (1,400 female workers to 500 male) in that region as well as retail trade (3,100 female workers to 900 male). Education and training is pretty much all women. You can pick any regional area and see similar trends. (Incidentally, Queensland has seen the largest growth in fees for centre-based childcare and family daycare since 2018, according to the ACCC report.) Skilled and unskilled women are the great sleeping giants of the regional economy. We have written about teachers who can\u2019t teach for lack of childcare options. Or nurses who cannot work in ICU for lack of childcare options and long distances. Keeping women out of the regional (and city) workforces by lack of childcare also sets up an early pattern where female earnings plummet. This has long-term effects on superannuation, career advancement and even housing. At the same time, local councils can tell you that workforce shortages could be alleviated by more childcare options. Paul Fernee, the director of community wellbeing at Gannawarra shire council, told Guardian Australia last year: \u201cGetting people to move here and find a house is almost as hard as getting childcare, but people who are already here can\u2019t get childcare and can\u2019t get back into work.\u201d So if you think childcare is a \u201csoft\u201d issue, or if you think your child rearing years are over and it doesn\u2019t concern you, please understand that childcare is an issue that has knock-on effects on every other part of your town, your state and your country\u2019s economy, not to mention its wellbeing. Childcare is as important, and connected, to all the other big issues in regional Australia such as worker shortages, lack of housing and health services and the ongoing teacher shortage.

The goats are a motley, multicoloured lot; some have beards, others sport mohawks or woolly mops, long hair or short. There are curved horns, tufty tails and soft eyes. But this motley crew \u2013 born wild then rounded up \u2013 has helped make Australia the largest exporter of goat meat in the world.   Related:Carp Diem: targeting the \u2018perfect invasive species\u2019 one fishing competition at a time    Deshon and his sons, Tom, Harry and Jack, work on their 24,000 hectare (59,300 acre) property between Cumborah and Lightning Ridge in northern New South Wales. They have been operating a goat depot since 2003, sourcing small numbers of feral goats from pastoralists from Moree to Gilgandra and collating them for transport to the abattoir in Bourke, where up to 3,500 can be processed daily.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  In the heady days of 2021, goat prices at the abattoir peaked at $10/kg carcass weight, before plummeting to $2.40 at the end of 2023. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no price, no one chases the goats,\u201d Deshon says. \u201cAt the end of 2023 there was not much coming in the gate, and we didn\u2019t have a lot of feed. \u201cThen it started raining and the price went up to $3.20 and people started chasing them again. Now we\u2019re back in the game, the feed is unreal, and the goats are pumping on weight.\u201d    Feral goats are found all over Australia, but western NSW is where they are most prevalent, with the last count, in 2020, estimating a population of 4.9 million. According to Meat and Livestock Australia 2,364,307 goats, worth $235m, were slaughtered in 2023. That\u2019s only 0.4% of global production, and domestically, the market is small. Just 9% of Australian goat meat is consumed onshore. The rest is exported: Australia produces 35% of all goat meat exports, and accounts for 44% of the global export value of goat meat. Most is exported as frozen whole carcasses.    The biggest market is the United States, accounting for an average 60% volume share over the past five years. Goat, an affordable meat that has a low fat content, high iron levels, and no religious restrictions, is popular in Hispanic and Muslim communities. Feral rangeland goats still make up the bulk of the market in Australia, through goat depots. Goat depots are collection points that allows operators like Deshon to bypass Australia\u2019s livestock tracing system and tagging requirements, provided the goat goes directly from the property of capture to a goat depot to an abattoir. But farmed production systems are on the rise, encouraged by the NSW government, which recently invested $1.2m into the industry through its Going Ahead with Goats project. \u201cOur goat producers in western NSW are at the forefront of the goat industry and the NSW government is supporting them with a number of resources so goat producers and stakeholders can take their goat business and the industry to the next level,\u201d the NSW agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, says.    But the Invasive Species Council has warned against increasing goat production, estimating that feral goats cause losses to livestock farming of $25m a year. \u201cGoats are one of the worst invasive species because they stop regeneration of bushland, they overgraze [vegetation], they outcompete native animals and they erode soils and stream banks,\u201d the Invasive Species Council\u2019s advocacy director, Jack Gough, says. \u201cThey have been recognised under federal environment law as a direct threat to species on the brink of extinction and one of the emerging threats is the reduction of carbon storage due to their eating of woody vegetation.\u201d   Related: Farmers who graze sheep under solar panels say it improves productivity. So why don\u2019t we do it more?     Kieran Smith is the goat adviser with NSW Local Land Services, the body responsible for the administration of the Going Ahead with Goats project. He says the damage caused by feral goats is not specific to goats \u2013 it would be a problem with any uncontrolled herbaceous animal. \u201cWe work with landholders to manage total grazing pressure, which considers the number of domestic, native and pest species, to produce positive outcomes for the landscape,\u201d Smith says. Goats are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments meaning farming requires little to no chemical inputs. \u201cThey can also control weeds in the landscape and their production has considerable economic value for western NSW communities, not just the landholders but flow on effects from truck drivers to abattoir workers,\u201d Smith says.    The main barriers to commercialisation of goats have been the lack of suitable infrastructure and the seasonal variation of the wild goat population. The Going Ahead with Goats program aims to upskill producers to improve productivity and profitability and research the development of sustainable genetic improvements, especially the introduction of Boer and Kalahari goats. But Deshon is happy to remain harvesting the feral population. \u201cFarmed goats need to be ear-tagged but if goats go straight to the abattoir you don\u2019t need to tag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a busy year I\u2019ve processed up to 10,000 goats and tagging all of them would be a nightmare, plus there are safety issues handling the big billies. Ours is a low-cost operation and you can still make a bob out of it when the prices are low.\u201d  Mandy McKeesick is a writer and former cattle farmer from central Queensland Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Protecting private land to save the plains-wanderer, a bird \u2018teetering on the edge of extinction\u2019 [2024-07-09T15:00:34Z]": "The wide, dry grasslands of north-west Victoria are home to one of Australia\u2019s rarest birds. Graziers who have lived alongside the elusive animal for generations have joined forces with conservationists to keep the species alive. Bill McGillivray\u2019s family has owned property on the Patho Plains in north-central Victoria for more than 70 years. \u201cMy father and partner bought the property in the late 40s just after the second world war and they had about 12,000 acres,\u201d the 80-year-old says. \u201cThey sold it off, but I\u2019ve still got the original block they started with.\u201d Of the 1,400 hectares (about 3,500 acres) that McGillivray owns, he says there are parts that have been grazed by sheep and cattle but have not otherwise been touched. That has left the native mix intact, which makes it an ideal habitat for the critically endangered plains-wanderer.    In 2016, McGillivray and his wife, Sandra, permanently protected 137 hectares of their grasslands through the conservation organisation Trust for Nature after the birds were recorded on the property through the use of song meters. Now, the couple plans on adding 236 hectares more to the covenant. The north-west area manager of Trust for Nature, David Dore, says an estimated 500 to 1,000 hectares of Murray Valley grasslands continue to be lost every year due to cropping and pasture improvement, so securing the remaining patches is critical to the long-term integrity of the endangered ecosystem.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cWe are very excited about it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is known prime habitat for the plains-wanderer, validated through song meter recordings over many years and regular nocturnal surveys.\u201d Conservation covenants result in a permanent, legally binding agreement to prevent activities that might damage native habitat such as intensive cropping or development. The covenant is registered on the property title and protects the plains-wanderer habitat even when the land changes ownership.      The plains-wanderer, Pedionomus torquatus, is a ground-dwelling bird that depends on native grasslands. They\u2019re notoriously difficult to spot and have to be startled by spotlights at night to make their presence known. Standing at about 12cm tall, the bird\u2019s fawn-coloured feathers blend in with Australia\u2019s arid plains. Their main populations are now in the New South Wales Riverina and northern Victoria with some recorded in outback South Australia and south-west Queensland. The population in Victoria has declined by 95%, according to a 2015 threatened species assessment by the federal environment department, which recommended the bird\u2019s conservation assessment be upgraded from vulnerable to critically endangered. Numbers also declined by 84% decline in the NSW Riverina region. The total estimated number of mature plains-wanderers in 2015 was less than 1,000. In 2020, that number was revised down to an estimated 250 mature birds left in the wild.   Related: Australian zoo breeds rare plains-wanderer by replacing absent father with feather duster    The biggest threat to the bird\u2019s survival is the loss of remnant grassland. Overgrazing, use of pesticides and predation by cats and foxes were also listed as concerns. BirdLife Australia\u2019s national public affairs manager, Sean Dooley, says the loss of native grassland has left the birds with very few options. Dooley says the 2020 population estimate, contained in the Action Plan for Australian Birds, was concerning. \u201cThe numbers can fluctuate according to the season, and there may be other small populations of this hard-to-detect species, but even if the population is double or triple that, it is still extremely precarious, teetering on the edge of extinction,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the last decade we have made some real strides in protecting plains-wanderers with several conservation reserves established to protect habitat, and the management of those remnants has gotten so much better to keep conditions favourable. \u201cMuch of the best remaining habitat is on private property and this is why covenanting schemes like Trust for Nature are so vital.\u201d    Another such privately owned grassland belongs to George Cullinan. The 98-year-old farmer, from Jil Jil in Victoria\u2019s north-west, has placed 91 hectares of his property into a conservation covenant with Trust for Nature to protect the \u201clittle birds\u201d. \u201cWhen we took the deed to the covenant out to [Cullinan], he said, \u2018well as long as the little birds are OK\u2019,\u201d Dore says. \u201cHe\u2019s very simple but heartfelt and takes a great deal of pleasure knowing they are thriving on his property.\u201d   Related: Tiny solar backpacks could help save the plains wanderer \u2013 one of Australia\u2019s most endangered birds    There are other hopeful developments. A breeding program carried out by Zoos Victoria at the Werribee open range zoo has successfully produced 48 plains-wanderer chicks since their threatened species program launched in 2017. The organisation has partnerships with Trust for Nature, Parks Victoria, and private landholders to select sites to release the captive-born chicks and protect their remaining habitat. Zoos Victoria\u2019s general manager of threatened species and wildlife conservation science, Garry Peterson, says landholders such as the McGillivrays and Cullinan are integral to conservation efforts and critical to the success of the breeding program. A number of plains-wanderers have already been released as part of a three-year trial in partnership with Taronga Western Plains Zoo and Monarto Safari Park, which is intended to allow researchers to collect data on dispersal, breeding and survivorship, and refine monitoring technology. Dore says the partnership between private landholders and Trust for Nature works for both parties and for the environment. \u201cAn enormous amount of really threatened habitat is on private land so this is a way of exercising some influence on the conservation values of that land but still not removing someone\u2019s property rights,\u201d he says. \u201cPart of our job is not to be critical of other farming systems, but to remind people there are other ways of doing it that are a bit more in harmony with Australia\u2019s ecosystem.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "My Climate View: online tool allows Australian farmers to project changes out to 2070 [2024-06-02T15:00:07Z]": "In 30 years, Vicki Mayne\u2019s Queensland beef property will receive 30 more days of heatwaves a year. \u201cThat pushes us to 163 days of the year,\u201d she said. The prediction comes from an online tool developed by the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, called My Climate View. The tool provides farmers with long-term climate projections out to 2070. Farmers such as Mayne can plug in their farm\u2019s location and the commodity they produce, and receive information that can help them better understand the impact of global heating on their livelihood.

One farmer surveyed was planning on expanding his avocado operations but, after using the software, Malakar said, he decided to consider changing his crop altogether. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it,\u201d he said. Another farmer from Tasmanian was fearful of cold snaps damaging their crop but said the software\u2019s projection of fewer and less intense frosts in the region as the planet warms had eased that concern. The financial implications of a changing climate are already being felt. A 2019 report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences found the annual profit of Australian farms had decreased by 22% on average in the past two decades due to global heating. The program was funded by the Future Drought Fund. This month the government announced an additional $519m for the fund and said it would be restructured to better reflect global heating\u2019s threat to Australian agriculture. Peter Holding, an outreach officer for Farmers for Climate Action who runs a mixed sheep and cropping farm outside Young, New South Wales, said farmers were aware becoming of the challenges caused by a warming climate. \u201cMany farmers are recognising climate change, they are concerned about the extremes that are happening \u2026 more intense storms, more floods, more fires,\u201d he said.

The president of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, David Jockhinke, said he welcomed any tool that would help farmers understand and adapt to a changing climate. \u201cIn recent years the climate pendulum has swung from one extreme to the other and this isn\u2019t expected to slow down,\u201d Jockhinke said. \u201cWe know the more farmers can prepare, the better they can mitigate the hit to food production and their bottom line.\u201d One cropping and livestock farmer surveyed in the study said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more we could do to plan for that increase in heat.

In some exaggerated versions of the story, Clermont is the \u201clittle town that played a huge role\u201d in the 2019 election result, after locals helped organise a counter-protest when the Stop Adani convoy rolled into town. More than four years later, the miner and the Queensland government have become embroiled in a legal dispute about whether Adani has the right to exclude Clermont locals from work at the Carmichael mine. Under Queensland law, companies are banned from having a 100% fly-in, fly out workforce if there is a \u201cnearby regional community\u201d within 125km.   Related: \u2018Abuse of process\u2019: activist Ben Pennings seeks to have Adani case thrown out of court    In September, the assistant coordinator general, Kerry Smeltzer, wrote to Adani advising the company the state had decided to expand the \u201cnearby regional community\u201d area for the Carmichael mine to include the town of Clermont, which is 159km from the coal pits. \u201cAccordingly, this means the 100% fly-in, fly-out prohibition and anti-discrimination in recruitment provisions [which prohibit discrimination against locals applying for jobs] now apply to the project,\u201d Smeltzer said.

On 14 March, the Queensland government rescinded its determination, citing an \u201cadministrative error\u201d. Accordingly, the case lodged by Adani was abandoned but it is unlikely to be the end of the dispute.

In a social impact assessment for the Carmichael mine, Adani noted that the Clermont community had said a \u201cdesired outcome\u201d would include a \u201cprovision for workers to reside locally\u201d but that driving or bussing workers to the mine site from the town would only be considered once road access had improved. The upgrade of a mine access road was a condition of Adani\u2019s Queensland government approvals. Adani says works have begun, but the road is not complete and is behind schedule. The Isaac regional council launched legal action last year, claiming the road was a \u201c\u201cvital connection for rural residents, as well as suppliers and workers\u201d and that Adani had failed to meet its obligations.

About 4m hectares (9.9m acres) of Cape York \u2013 roughly 35% of the region\u2019s land area \u2013 is designated as national parkland, and part of a \u201cprotected estate\u201d jointly managed by traditional owners and governments. These protected areas provide environmental and cultural safeguards.   Related: \u2018This is monumental\u2019: Australia takes first step to world heritage nomination for parts of Cape York    Land tenure is otherwise complicated in Cape York. Large parts are covered by pastoral properties. Traditional owners have native title rights over about 45% of the region, but that designation does not necessarily protect land from industry or development. In recent years mining speculation has increased, prompting concerns that authorities needed to hasten efforts to expand the protected estate, especially in areas with strong ecological or cultural value. What is \u201ctentative\u201d listing?  A \u201ctentative\u201d listing is a first step towards a full world heritage listing. Countries can place sites on the Unesco tentative list, and they must be listed for a year before a world heritage nomination can proceed. Australia\u2019s tentative list submission is meant as a signal to Unesco that the commonwealth and Queensland governments \u201care committed to doing the work necessary to progress a world heritage nomination\u201d. The submission includes evidence that Cape York meets some of the 10 criteria for listing. How much of the Cape does it cover?  Governments say the exact boundaries of any world heritage listing will take years to negotiate, and these will depend on whether there is agreement and \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d from relevant traditional owners. The area submitted for the tentative listing falls entirely within six national parks \u2013 Kulla, Ma\u2019alpiku, Olkola, Oyala Thumotang and Wuthathi \u2013 and Quinkan Country, an area where ancient rock art displays have been preserved. The listed area would probably comprise several disconnected parcels of land \u2013 a \u201cserial\u201d world heritage property.   What will it mean for land tenure in the region?  The Queensland government has gone to significant lengths to stress that a world heritage listing would not override Australian land tenure rules, particularly in relation to pastoral properties. Those leases could even be extended in circumstances where \u201cthe land is considered to be in good condition and is managed to protect the significant values\u201d. What will it mean for tourism? Will you still be able to go?  The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said encouraging more tourism is a key reason behind pursuing the nomination. \u201cWe want this to be on the bucket list of visitors from around the world because it is so special globally,\u201d she said. World heritage areas globally have become significant attractions for tourists, and the listing will not place any restrictions on visiting. But the Cape \u2013 despite its unique natural and cultural environment \u2013 remains difficult to access and does not currently attract tourist numbers to rival other areas like the wet tropics, K\u2019gari or other national parks.

What\u00a0happens now?  The Queensland government says the next steps include more engagement with traditional owner groups, landowners and other stakeholders to contribute to the nomination process. The application for world heritage listing is a very detailed process \u2013 applicants need to identify and document the values that meet Unesco\u2019s criteria.

Related: Boorowa: the small town near Australia\u2019s capital that has been without drinking water for 26 days    \u201cDiesel pumps solved some of these issues by putting the pumping mechanism at ground level \u2026 but exposed pulleys and belts claimed their fair share of fingers, arms and lives.\u201d With new solar pumps entering the market and dramatically reducing the upfront cost, Fennell says she\u2019s seen a shift away from windmills to safer and more effective pumps. \u201cIn remote areas where labour is in short supply and access to qualified technicians is almost nonexistent, producers are now almost completely self-sufficient in the installation and maintenance of their solar water pumping,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a revolution for those of us who live and work in the rangelands of Australia.\u201d Eugowra farmer and photographer Kim Storey says that, in the latter role, she loves seeing windmills.  \u201cBut as a farmer, I understand and I\u2019m impressed by the progression in technology that\u2019s bringing solar pumps as a replacement,\u201d she says. Storey says windmills have become a symbol of Australian agriculture.  \u201cThe windmill is an iconic image of rural Australia, and has enabled farming to progress right across the country in the early days,\u201d she says. \u201cIt brings a sense of nostalgia to rural images.\u201d With albums full of windmills photographed at all hours of the day and night, Storey says she\u2019ll still keep an eye out for the older pumps when she\u2019s on the road with her camera gear. \u201cWhen I\u2019m looking at big skies and big sunsets, I\u2019m always looking for something in the foreground to create a bit of interest. When you find a windmill, that fits the bill pretty quickly,\u201d she says.

He said he had no issue with Forrest personally, but objected to the \u201cswindle-factory so-called windfarms all over our area\u201d. \n\u201cI thought I\u2019ll make a statement so people will say, \u2018why are you doing that?\u2019\u201d he said. \nWell, mission accomplished. But I remain confused. Because in the place of the RMs at question time earlier this month was a pair of Ariat cowboy boots. Specifically, my image searching revealed, the Cowpuncher VentTEK in the dark brown/golden mustard colourway. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nAccording to the product description, the boots are designed to provide \u201ca soft landing when you jump off the feed truck or off your horse\u201d, while the vents in the scrolling \u201ckeeps you cool in the heat or in branding season\u201d. \nThis is fine. I\u2019ve got nothing against a good pair of Ariats, though as a horse rider in the English disciplines my Ariats are a pair of half chaps. (That also precisely ages me, for anyone who follows equestrian fashion trends.) \nThey\u2019re also more comfortable than RM Williams \u2013 Joyce said as much in that interview. They\u2019re a work boot, and he is at work, and as a person who wears farm boots literally everywhere I cannot begrudge him on an aesthetic level. \n \n Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \n \nBut what perplexes me is why he chose Ariats. Ariat is a quintessentially American brand \u2013 it\u2019s named for the racehorse Secretariat. This would be like an American politician trying to appeal to their patriotic base by wearing boots called Phar Lap. The main argument for Australian politicians wearing RM Williams is that they are an iconic Australian brand \u2013 although before Forrest bought it the brand was owned by LVMH, more commonly known as Louis Vuitton. \nThe Australiana is, in the theatre of parliament, the whole point. We don\u2019t give visiting dignitaries an Akubra and a Driza-Bone because they\u2019re appropriate bureaucratic attire. If this can be cancelled out by a mining magnate following the economic winds and investing in renewable energy, a decision that whatever other motives you might ascribe is clearly that of a billionaire making a business decision, then we may as well have been wearing lace-ups this whole time. \nAriat is also not necessarily a choice that signals disdain for renewable energy: the Fisher family, founders of the Gap, bought the equestrian apparel company in 2012. The Gap has an emissions reduction goal of 90% by 2030 and its chairman, Robert Fisher, is an environmentalist who sat for 20 years on the board of the National Resources Defense Council, an organisation which supports, among other things, federal tax incentives to boost the renewable economy and responsible construction of offshore windfarms. \nIt is particularly perplexing because another boot option is right there: Gina Rinehart, who very loudly does not support renewable energy, bought Rossi Boots through her company S Kidman &amp; Co in December. As the Australian Financial Review pointed out, this set the stage for the \u201cbattle of the billionaire boots\u201d. You can now signal your allegiance simply by the stitching on your boot tug. \nBlundstone, which is still Australian-owned although they are no longer manufactured in Tasmania, is another option. Or Baxters, also Australian-owned and manufactured overseas. \nAs an extremely dorky horse girl who was \u2013 and remains \u2013 incapable of tying shoelaces so they won\u2019t become unravelled within 20 minutes, I have owned all of these boots. \n \n  Related: How the wind blows in Walcha: a community divided over renewable energy  \n \nI have RMs for the office, Blundstones for walking through mud on the farm, and Dublin short boots (or Jodhpur or paddock boots or whatever you want to call them except for Chelsea boot) for riding. The key consideration, with the exception of the RMs, which my mum gave me for my 30th birthday when she realised I was turning up to the office in a pair of extremely beat-up 15-year-old Baxters, is cost of replacement. I wear my boots until my socks soak through and the average lifespan is about two years. \nJoyce\u2019s Ariat roper boots ($450) or the standard shoe of Australian politics or consulting, the RM Craftsman ($649), are too expensive for such use. The latter are sale day boots, fancy boots \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the National party started wearing them in the first place. You would never wear your work boots to a livestock sale or a dinner or a political meeting. The well-kept chestnut leather of a pair of RMs that spends the rest of the month sitting buffed clean in the wardrobe is a sign of respect. \nDespite the price tag, roper boots don\u2019t really have that cachet. It\u2019s one thing to pretend to be a working farmer, it\u2019s another to cosplay as Clinton Anderson. \nBut perhaps that\u2019s the point. The Australian right is increasingly importing tactics from rightwing groups in the US, it may as well copy the footwear. As Joyce took to the stage at an anti-renewables rally in Canberra earlier this year, a man shouted into the microphone: \u201cWe need someone like Donald Trump to save us.\u201d \nHe may be a shoo-in. \n \n Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter \n Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community \n", "How many cattle are there in Australia? We may be out by 10 million [2024-03-10T14:00:05Z]": "Australia has underestimated how many cattle it has by about 10 million, with significant implications for tracking greenhouse gas emissions, a Queensland researcher has said. Cows\u2019 methane-laden burps are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions emitted by the red meat sector, which has an aspirational goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Official estimates, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, state there are 26 million beef and dairy cattle in Australia in 2024.   Related: Australian red meat industry\u2019s net zero target based on land-clearing data that is \u2018not reliable\u2019     But a 2021 report by the University of Queensland, published in the CSIRO Publishing journal Animal Production Science, concluded the real number could be about 35 million \u2013 56-75% higher than the figures published by the ABS and widely accepted by government and the red meat industry. The ABS estimate is also what is used to calculate emissions from the red meat industry. Geoffry Fordyce is a former veterinary scientist from the University of Queensland and lead author of the report. He said the findings further challenges the assumption that there has been a 65% reduction in emissions from Australia\u2019s red meat industry on 2005 levels. That reduction was calculated in another report by the CSIRO, commissioned by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), and has already been called into question by scientists who say it is also based on unreliable land clearing data. \u201cThey\u2019re working with faulty data,\u201d Fordyce said. \u201cIf they admit there\u2019s 10 million more cattle than they originally thought, they\u2019ve got a real problem.\u201d The ABS figures are based on surveys completed by farmers, which are then extrapolated into national figures. Fordyce, who has spent more than 40 years working on cattle stations across Queensland and south-east Asia, said farmers \u201copenly admit they underreport what they\u2019ve got\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of sentiment associated with big brother, the taxation office and all the rest of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want anyone to know what they\u2019re really doing.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The ABS\u2019s head of agriculture statistics, Rob Walter, said while he had \u201ca lot of confidence\u201d in the farm surveys, they were never designed to measure Australia\u2019s total cattle population because they excluded small-scale producers. \u201cThey are clearly a lower estimate than the actual number of cattle,\u201d Walter said. Walter said there was \u201cprobably a level\u201d of underreporting in ABS surveys, particularly in Northern Australia. \u201cSome of those properties in Northern Australia are the size of small European countries,\u201d he said. \u201cFor them to know how many cattle they have [on reporting day] can be very difficult.\u201d The underreporting affects the total greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the Australian beef sector. Australia\u2019s beef cattle herd is estimated to have released the equivalent of 57 million tonnes of C02 annually in methane between 2015 and 2020. If Fordyce\u2019s estimates on total cattle numbers are used, that figure could be as high as 90 million tonnes.    \u2018There wouldn\u2019t be enough cattle\u2019 Farmers in Australia are required to register cattle, sheep and goats through the national livestock identification system (NLIS). Livestock must be fitted with an electronic ear tag before it is moved between properties or taken to a saleyard. But that requirement only kicks in when the animal leaves the property. Walter said because herd fertility rates and the portion of cattle that leave the farm are highly variable year on year, the number of cattle on farms can be hard to determine. Fordyce said his team arrived at the shortfall of 10 million cattle by working back from slaughter, export and mortality data, which is accurately tracked through the NLIS. \u201cWe figured out that, roughly speaking, there are about 10 million cattle exiting the industry each year.\u201d he said. \u201cIf you believe the industry\u2019s data, the herd would disappear in a few years. There wouldn\u2019t be enough cattle [on farms] to support that kind of output each year.\u201d The ABS discontinued its farm surveys in July 2023 due to declining response rates and to reduce reporting burden on farmers, Walter said. He said the ABS was working with government, industry groups and academics, including Fordyce, to produce new figures using a range of data sources that better reflect the actual number of cows in Australia. Walter expects the new data, to be released in May, to be higher than previous survey-based reporting. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a commitment to making things easier for farmers, as well as to increase the availability of quality data,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for MLA said the unaware of underreporting of cattle numbers, but that it can be difficult to estimate how many cattle there are on remote properties on reporting day. The association conducts its own online survey to gather data on the national herd. \u201cMLA will continue to support activities to ensure the most accurate data is available to inform the red meat industry\u2019s progress in terms of emissions,\u201d they said. \u201cIf improved datasets become available, these will be incorporated.\u201d The chief executive of the Northern Territory Cattle Association, Will Evans, said there was \u201cno advantage\u201d to producers in underreporting cattle but that \u201cwe don\u2019t currently have a tool \u2026 to accurately estimate the size of the national herd\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot less people working in the regions than we used to who are able to verify and accurately collect data,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou need people driving around in utes talking to people.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter   Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community  \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2024 because the study led by Geoffry Fordyce was conducted by the University of Queensland and published in a journal owned by CSIRO publishing, it was not a CSIRO study as an earlier version said.", "Holdout states given deadline to sign up to school funding agreement [2024-07-30T15:00:13Z]": "The federal government has ramped up pressure on NSW, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia to sign on to the next school funding agreement as it rushes out the blueprint for the next decade of primary and secondary education. The states, which have been holding out on reaching a deal amid calls for higher levels of commonwealth funding for public schools, will now have until September to agree to the proposed 2.5% federal increase, or keep the old agreement. The new agreement also ties school funding to targets \u2013 including Naplan results, attendance and graduation rates \u2013 but falls short of stating how or when all Australian schools will ever reach full funding levels.

But the federal education minister, Jason Clare, is still working with the remaining states to secure their agreement to his current offer of a 2.5% overall increase in commonwealth funding to public schools by 2029. State governments have maintained their opposition to the WA deal, banding together to demand a 5% commonwealth funding increase, citing budgetary pressures. Clare said there were no \u201cblank cheques\u201d on offer in the next agreement. \u201cI want to invest billions into our public schools and I want to make sure that money makes a difference to the kids who really need it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Northern Territory has signed up and Western Australia is expected to be the next to sign up. The remaining states and territories have until the end of September to confirm they will sign this agreement or continue with the current funding arrangements.\u201d The agreement offers $16bn to go to public schools over the next decade, addressing \u201cequity and excellence, wellbeing for learning and engagement and a strong and sustainable workforce\u201d. The Albanese government will also introduce legislation into parliament that will scrap the current funding cap that stops the commonwealth from providing extra funding to public schools. \u201cI have made clear that the additional $16bn of funding for public schools I have put on the table will be tied to reforms,\u201d Clare said.   Related: School funding reform to be tied to better outcomes for children with disability, Jason Clare says    They include early phonics and numeracy checks to identify students in need, catch-up tutoring, greater wellbeing support and rewarding teachers to work in schools that need them. The agreement also sets out targets to improve graduation and attendance rates and close the equity gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students; students living in regional, rural and remote locations; students with disability and students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. By 2030, the proportion of students leaving school with a year 12 certificate is targeted to reach a record rate of 83.8%, compared with 76.3% in 2022. The proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (aged 20-24) with a year 12 or equivalent qualification is targeted to reach 96% by 2031, aligned with Closing the Gap targets.

During the course of the past week, the death of Molly Ticehurst, a 28-year-old childcare worker in the New South Wales town of Forbes, sparked outrage just a day before the body of Emma Bates, 49, was found in Cobram, Victoria. The mayor of Forbes, Phyllis Miller, says Ticehurst was loved by many and that her death had left many families and the children she cared for reeling. \u201cMolly was a very beautiful young woman and very highly regarded in our community,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThe whole system has let her down badly.\u201d This year, 26 women in Australia have been killed \u2013 a rate of one death every four days \u2013 according to data compiled by advocacy group Destroy the Joint\u2019s project Counting Dead Women.

In Ballarat, Victoria\u2019s third-largest regional city, the rally on Friday marked the second time in a month residents had marched the city\u2019s streets demanding an end to the killing of women. An earlier protest came a week after the body of Hannah McGuire, from the nearby town of Clunes, was found dead in a burnt-out car in a state forest, and within 48 hours of police launching a new and unsuccessful search for the body of Samantha Murphy, allegedly murdered on 4 February after leaving her family home to go for a run.

Elise Phillips, the deputy chief executive of Domestic Violence NSW, says resourcing in regional and rural areas is a major issue. In particular, the lack of housing and crisis accommodation. \u201cWomen are having to choose between being homeless or between continuing to experience abuse,\u201d she says. Phillips points out that the Victorian government spends more than all of the other states and territories combined on DVF services. The NSW government spends less than half of what Victoria does, despite supporting a larger population. \u201cThis means that frontline services on the ground are struggling to meet demand and frontline workers are faced with having to turn vulnerable women and children away,\u201d says Phillips.

Antoinette Braybrook, the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal-community controlled family violence prevention and legal service Djirra, also says data on the number of murdered and missing First Nations women is poor. \u201cThe most recent national data suggests that Aboriginal women are 33 times more likely to be hospitalised and 11 times more likely to die from a violent assault than other women.

But it found that in more than a third of complaint investigations reviewed by the commission, police failed to investigate reports of DVF properly, and the bulk of the work is still carried out by general police officers. Though there is training related to responding to DVF, the training is not mandatory, and the lack of training was highlighted as an issue in the cases reviewed by the watchdog. The police agreed in principle to a recommendation from the report to make the training mandatory and increase the frequency. The watchdog recommended that NSW follow Victoria and Queensland and establish separate commands which deal with DVF.

Crisafulli categorically ruled out repealing abortion laws if he wins government in 2024, five years after he voted against its decriminalisation. Only three LNP members broke ranks to support the laws at the time, including Steve Minnikin, Jann Stuckey and Tim Nicholls.

It\u2019s an issue that divides the nation, pitting the bush against the city and states and territories against each other. \nNow, there are fresh calls from farmers to further fragment Australia\u2019s complicated array of timezones. \nOn Wednesday, delegates at the New South Wales Farmers Association conference voted that the organisation should campaign for daylight saving to be shortened in NSW. \nThe farmers argue the daylight saving period has gradually become longer in the state \u2013 expanding from four months in 1972 (November to February); to five months in 2002; to its current six-month window (the first weekend of October to the first weekend in April). \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nThe motion was not without controversy. Delegates were initially asked to back a motion that called for daylight saving to be shortened to four months again \u2013 but that was amended to be less specific. The motion that passed simply stated \u201cthat NSW Farmers seek the shortening of daylight saving\u201d. \nThe NSW Farmers Association president, Xavier Martin, said \u201cthe protracted daylight saving period \u2013 which seems to get a couple of weeks longer every few years \u2013 was debated with delegates pointing out the huge difference in sunrises and sunsets between Sydney and Broken Hill\u201d. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nA six-month daylight saving period remains popular in coastal cities where people can do outdoor activities and swim after work later into the year. But the farmers\u2019 motion claimed that in the first and last weeks of daylight saving, children are going to school on rural roads when it\u2019s dark. \nOne supporter of the motion said they left home at 7.15am to drive their child to catch the school bus. Having the \u201cwhole family up in the dark\u201d upset the sleep of everyone in the house, they said, adding that driving at that hour was dangerous due to the increased risk of fog and animals on the road. \nThey argued children were sleep-deprived and arrived at school having not eaten breakfast affecting their mood and attention. If there wasn\u2019t daylight saving, 7.15am would, of course, be 6.15am so people would be sleeping for longer while it was dark. \nThe farmers association motion mentioned studies that point to harms caused by disrupting the body\u2019s circadian rhythm and how Covid restrictions reset expectations of work hours and flexible arrangements. \n \n  Related: Should we abolish daylight saving time \u2013 or apply it across Australia?   \n \n\u201cThe debate should not be \u2018Why don\u2019t Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia have daylight savings?\u2019 but rather \u2018Why southern states still do\u2019?\u201d the motion stated. \nDaylight saving \u2013 not \u201csavings\u201d as per common misconception \u2013 creates a bizarre patchwork of time zones across the country. \nDaylight saving is in place in NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the ACT, but not Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia. \nGenerally, residents in northern and tropical parts of Australia \u2013 with particularly harsh summers \u2013 prefer sunset to occur earlier in the day. \nResidents in south-east Queensland and northern NSW can cross the border multiple times a day meaning they regularly switch time zones. \nThe health risks of changing time zones are amplified by critics, but daylight saving also boasts many benefits, beyond making a post-work swim a reality. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nIt can save energy, researchers claim, because natural light is favoured in the morning over the evening transition to darkness. Also, with more people staying out ahead of a later sunset, a traditional spike in post-work energy usage and pressure on the electricity grid is flattened. \nIn 2010 in the UK, there was a campaign to move the clocks forward one hour for the entire year, meaning there would effectively be two hours of daylight saving during summer and an hour extra of evening daylight during winter. \nIn terms of carbon emissions, British proponents cited modelling that suggested about 450,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide could be saved annually. \nDaylight saving has its roots in energy conservation. During the second world war, when facing an energy crisis brought on by a shortage of coalminers who had gone to fight, the UK temporarily set its clocks ahead an extra hour to save energy. Australia also adjusted its clocks during wartime. \nThe British campaign for extra daylight saving \u2013 which was ultimately torpedoed by a handful of MPs seeking amendments \u2013 also estimated that road deaths would be reduced by about 80 in the UK annually if \u201cdouble daylight time\u201d was adopted. \nStudies have also found economic benefits with daylight saving. People tend to stay out later and the increased foot traffic and retail activity boosts the economy.", "Australian red meat industry\u2019s net zero target based on land-clearing data that is \u2018not reliable\u2019  [2024-02-12T14:00:19Z]": "Greenhouse gas reduction figures celebrated by Australia\u2019s red meat industry are based on unreliable land-clearing data and could be erroneous, an independent analysis has found. In Queensland, where roughly 44% of the national cattle herd grazes and the majority of land clearing has occurred, the Statewide Landcover and Tree Study (Slats) has recorded deforestation at almost twice the rate of the national system used to calculate emissions on the red meat industry. In an analysis of both systems, Martin Taylor, a former conservation scientist with WWF Australia and now adjunct senior lecturer at the University of Queensland, found the national carbon accounting system (NCAS) may be significantly underreporting deforestation in the state.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cIt\u2019s good Meat and Livestock Australia is attempting to reduce their emissions but it has to be based on reliable data,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be building stories on data that analysis suggests is erroneous.\u201d MLA has widely publicised a 65% reduction in emissions compared with 2005 levels. Nearly 90% of the industry\u2019s emissions are associated with the production and processing of beef cattle.   Related: Australian red meat industry says it doesn\u2019t need to meet its self-imposed net zero target    Taylor\u2019s latest report, released in December, analysed satellite data from 2018-19 and 20219-20 and concluded deforestation in Queensland is 36-62% higher than NCAS reporting. These findings are yet to be peer reviewed. \u201cThe reported decline in red meat industry emissions is almost totally due to declining deforestation and rising regeneration reported in the national greenhouse accounts,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if those accounts are not reliable and under-report deforestation it throws the industry claim into doubt.\u201d According to the source of MLA\u2019s claim \u2013 a 2022 CSIRO report based on NCAS data \u2013 decreasing deforestation means land managed by the sector has become a net carbon sink. The report found that land cleared to make way for grazing pastures emitted 87 megatonnes of CO2 across Australia in 2005. But in 2020, increasing forest regrowth offset land-clearing emissions, and land managed by the industry \u2013 which equates to half Australia\u2019s land mass \u2013 sequestered one tonne of CO2 from atmosphere in total.   Interactive Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions measure the amount of CO2 emitted by deforestation or sequestered in soils and vegetation.   The author of the CSIRO report, Dr Brad Ridoutt, said the data used to produce the figure had \u201csignificant potential for uncertainty\u201d but is consistent and retrospectively updated as the NCAS becomes more accurate. \u201cThe national figures are not based on laboratory samples, they are based on models,\u201d he said. Dr Beverley Henry from the University of Technology Queensland said the industry\u2019s recorded decrease in emissions since 2005 was largely due to the introduction of stricter environmental laws and lessening economic incentives to clear increasingly marginal land, rather than any sector-led initiatives. \u201cWhen they publish their emission reductions land-use changes should be separated out,\u201d Henry said. If changes in land use were excluded from the sector\u2019s emissions accounting, greenhouse gases would have been just 11% lower in 2020 compared with 2005 levels; though Ridoutt\u2019s report found this was mostly due to a reduction in livestock numbers.    Since 2020, the size of the national beef cattle herd has increased by roughly 2 million, returning to similar levels seen in 2005. In the early 1990s, Henry assisted in building the land-use emissions component of the NCAS. Later she worked in the Queensland Slats team. She said that while the veracity of both systems has improved over time, Queensland\u2019s state system measures changes in tree cover more accurately. However, she added that the NCAS system is based on standardised accounting set by the United Nations and should be used. \u201cIf we are going to have credibility it is appropriate to use data consistent with these accounts,\u201d she said. \u201cBut its accuracy at any location is a different question.\u201d Separating land-clearing data in the industry\u2019s marketing material would provide a more accurate picture of their own sustainability efforts, she said. \u201cI think increasing the efficiency of production is very worthwhile for a whole lot of reasons and will lead to lower emissions per kilogram of meat,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe, based on what we know now, it is possible for the industry to become carbon neutral.\u201d Last week, MLA said their self-imposed target is \u201cnot necessarily something that needs to be met\u201d, although it has since reaffirmed its commitment to reaching the goal.   Interactive   The director of the Australian National University Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, Mark Howden, said the 2005 baseline is a convenient choice to demonstrate greenhouse gas reductions. \u201cGenerally speaking, that period around 2005-07 was peak emissions from land-use change [due to land clearing],\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at peak emissions, there is only one way to go, and that\u2019s down.\u201d   Related: Breeding the perfect Australian sheep: \u2018You recognise the elite ones right away\u2019    Howden said including land-use changes in emissions accounting is \u201clegitimate\u201d but it\u2019s a one-off reduction. \u201cIf you stop land clearing then clearly you can\u2019t use that on a continuing basis to push your emissions down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you\u2019ve then got to reduce your actual emissions.\u201d An MLA spokesperson said the NCAS data is appropriate given it is public, low cost and nationally consistent. \u201cMLA would welcome any improvements to national datasets that delivers improved accuracy at a macro scale,\u201d a spokesperson said. They said MLA is \u201cforthright about the contribution of [land-use change emissions] to deliver the majority of net emissions reduction to date\u201d.  And they said that since 2017 the red meat industry has spent more than $180m on research and development focused on reducing methane emissions from burping cattle, which accounts for almost 80% of the industry\u2019s annual emissions. But these technologies are yet to prove commercially viable. \u201cThe net emissions reduction delivered by sequestration does not diminish from the continued investment in solutions and technology for the industry to reduce methane [produced by cattle],\u201d a spokesperson said.

What happened? [2024-01-03T03:11:22Z]": "The famed and feared El Ni\u00f1o climate system is often linked to hotter and drier springs and summers for Australia, but the torrential and damaging storms and floods on the east coast in recent weeks have been anything but dry. So what\u2019s happened to the El Ni\u00f1o that experts warned earlier could mean warmer and drier weather and increased bushfire risk for much of the country? The Bureau of Meteorology declared the El Ni\u00f1o in September, three months after US weather agency NOAA and two months after the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Agency.   Related: Australia may face a summer of heatwaves, even without El Ni\u00f1o    One bureau climate expert noted that this El Ni\u00f1o was developing when global ocean surface temperatures had been at record high levels for months, and that the changing climate was making forecasting more challenging. What is El Ni\u00f1o? El Ni\u00f1o is the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (Enso) \u2013 the shifting of warm waters in the tropical Pacific \u2013 that usually delivers warmer and drier conditions for many parts of Australia. In the La Ni\u00f1a phase of Enso, the opposite is true. But Dr Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, says the link between Enso and how it influences rainfall is much stronger in La Ni\u00f1a cycles than it is during El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o events are typically a bit drier than average, mainly in spring,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you only need a few weather systems coming through and you can get wetter than usual. People are forgetting how dry early spring was.\u201d According to bureau data, the spring months of September, October and November were only slightly drier than average across most of New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia and particularly dry in South Australia and Tasmania. September and October were particularly dry. Those months coincided with a shift in the Indian Ocean that took warmer waters away from the north-west of the continent and that can also mean less rain. This phenomenon \u2013 known as the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole \u2013 is expected to fade in the coming weeks. But the first month of summer, December, was generally average or slightly wetter than usual in parts of NSW, QLD, SA and Victoria and drier than usual for the NT, Tasmania and WA. What about temperatures? Globally, 2023 was the warmest year on record. Experts say El Ni\u00f1os tend to have a greater influence on temperatures the year after they are declared. For Australia, the El Ni\u00f1o has coincided with above average temperatures almost everywhere in spring.    Overall, 2023 tied with 2016 as Australia\u2019s eighth warmest year on record, but spring of 2023 was the fifth warmest on record. Many areas were under heatwave conditions throughout December, including Sydney and parts of Queensland. The middle of December saw bushfires in New South Wales. For December, bureau data suggests almost all states were on average at least 1C warmer than usual, with South Australia only slightly warmer than normal. Why has it not been dry? Last year, a study led by the CSIRO of Enso cycles going back to 1950 suggested that El Ni\u00f1os don\u2019t necessarily guarantee dry periods. \u201cBut they do heavily slant your chances away from it being very wet,\u201d said Dr James Risbey, a climate scientist and co-author of the study. The study also suggested that in coastal areas east of the Great Dividing Range from south-east Queensland to Gippsland in Victoria, the link between drier periods and El Ni\u00f1os is quite weak. The link was stronger in inland areas, including the Murray-Darling Basin. Risbey says WA tended not to be influenced much by ENSO. Dr Andrea Taschetto, an expert on Enso at the University of New South Wales, says each El Ni\u00f1o is different and that they are just one of many factors that influence Australia\u2019s weather. She points to another important influence that is likely influencing rainfall right now: the position of the east-to-west winds to the south of Australia. If those winds are closer to Antarctica in summer \u2013 which they currently are in what\u2019s known as the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode \u2013 this tends to increase winds blowing from the Tasman Sea on to the eastern seaboard, translating to a higher chance of rain for large parts of south-east Australia, including south-east Queensland. Taschetto says the area of the Tasman Sea that supplies moisture to the east of the country has been unusually warm through December. She says: \u201cIf you combine [those warmer sea temperatures] with the positive SAM, then you have a perfect combination for increased rain over the eastern part of Australia.\u201d Before Christmas, the bureau had suggested the unusually warm waters in the Tasman Sea \u201cmay also be contributing to a chance of above median summer rainfall over parts of Australia\u201d. Extremes hard to predict In late November, the bureau\u2019s long-term forecast suggested the chances were about even of there being above or below average rainfall in December across much of the country. The bureau\u2019s model suggested northern parts would probably be dry.   Related: Cyclone Jasper: how did it cause so much rain and could global heating be to blame?    Cyclone Jasper dumped huge amounts of rain in far north Queensland last month, and the south-east of the state and northern NSW have been hit by violent storms and flash flooding since Christmas. Risbey says the weather systems that have delivered storms have been unusually \u201cwell organised\u201d and persistent over large areas in recent weeks, \u201cbut it\u2019s too early to say why\u201d. Andrew King says in any case, extreme events are much harder for forecasters to predict more than a few days in advance. The bureau\u2019s long-term weather outlooks that stretch out over three months can\u2019t account for storms and cyclones so far ahead. \u201cSeasonal outlooks will always struggle with those big systems,\u201d King says. \u201cIn summer the seasonal outlooks are less skilful because rain is mostly falling from storm systems.\u201d The Bureau of Meteorology declined to be interviewed. What is the role of climate change? According to the most recent State of the Climate report, there is evidence that storms in Australia are becoming more intense \u2013 that is, delivering more rain. This trend is expected to increase as the planet keeps heating up. Dr Jaci Brown, of CSIRO\u2019s Climate Science Centre, says one major concern from global heating was the effect of \u201ccompounding events\u201d on societies \u2013 the times when multiple extremes happen almost simultaneously. \u201cWe\u2019ve had heatwaves, bushfires and floods happening together [in recent weeks],\u201d she says. \u201cEven if these events are not due to climate change, it is a glimpse of what we should be preparing for in the future.\u201d", "\u2018This feels like home to me\u2019: how an Australian bush cricket competition is helping women find themselves [2024-03-12T14:00:46Z]": "As Camilla Doolin stands tapping her bat on the crease of one of Goondiwindi\u2019s prime cricket pitches, watchfully waiting for the bowler, a quiet but stinging heckle comes from behind the stumps.

The $75bn red meat industry, led by Meat and Livestock Australia, announced a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2030 seven years ago, in an attempt to maintain its social licence and drive investments in emissions reduction technology. But climate and agricultural scientists have said the target is unachievable and MLA itself said it was \u201cnot necessarily something that needs to be met\u201d.   Related: Australian red meat industry has recorded 78% reduction in emissions since 2005, industry report found    A report commissioned by the MLA, released on Thursday, found the sector had as of 2021 reduced its net emissions by 78% compared with 2005 levels. The reductions were due to recorded increases in forest regrowth that have offset the sector\u2019s methane emissions, which increased on the previous year and account for the majority of its annual impact on global heating. The report uses figures from the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which scientists suggest is underreporting land-clearing in Queensland and therefore may not be an accurate basis for calculating emissions reduction. The MLA has said the national carbon accounting system is the appropriate data source to use. Despite the on-paper progress toward net zero, Cattle Australia, the peak body for producers of grass-fed cattle, argues that the target should be abandoned in favour of a \u201cclimate neutral\u201d goal. That would theoretically be reached when the sector\u2019s heating impact on the climate stabilises and no longer contributes to additional global heating.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The push follows a report released last year by Dr Brad Ridoutt from the CSIRO, which found the industry would fall short of the net zero target and recommended it adopt a climate neutral goal instead. In a business-as-usual scenario, Ridoutt\u2019s report found the industry would almost reach climate neutrality by 2030. The Cattle Australia deputy chair, Adam Coffey, said producers were \u201cafter recognition that our [methane] emissions are inherently different from cumulative fossil (CO2) emissions\u201d. \u201cWhat we are calling for is a review and revaluation of greenhouse gas targets so we can determine the best way forward \u2026 we\u2019re just questioning the process,\u201d Coffey said. But the suggestion has been criticised by climate scientists. Prof Mark Howden, the director of the Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions at the Australian National University, said the model used to measure progress towards climate neutrality had no standing and the target \u201cmisses the point\u201d, which is to keep global temperatures below 1.5C. Climate neutral a \u2018misleading\u2019 concept In another study, Ridoutt concluded that Australia\u2019s sheep sector was already climate neutral and would contribute to \u201cclimate cooling\u201d in the future. That study was mentioned in a 2023 report published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, which found some claims about climate neutrality distorted the impact of livestock production on global heating. The report also criticised work by scientists with close links to the US cattle industry, which in 2021 adopted a goal of being climate neutral by 2040. The report\u2019s lead author, the University of California Davis environmental scientist Dr Caspar Donnison, told Guardian Australia that claims of being climate neutral were misleading. \u201cIf Australian sheep meat is climate negative, that would imply that the more you eat, the better it is for the planet, which is a completely distorted understanding of the science,\u201d Donnison told Guardian Australia. Another study, published in the same journal, found that climate neutral goals are inequitable and favoured developed countries with relatively stable herd sizes, such as Australia. The director of the University of Melbourne\u2019s Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre, Prof Richard Eckard, said a climate neutral target was a \u201cvery dangerous position for the industry\u201d. He said it would impede investment in methane reduction technologies and be disregarded by global supply chains which are trying to meet their own emissions reduction goals. The Cattle Australia chief executive, Dr Chris Parker, said: \u201cThere is a range of scientific viewpoints in this space and current systems are not set up to appropriately account for those industries where methane is the majority of their emissions, such as the grass-fed cattle industry.\u201d Ridoutt declined to comment to Guardian Australia but, in a statement, a CSIRO spokesperson said there were different methods for tracking greenhouse pollutants and it was \u201cup to industry to decide on the path to take to reduce emissions\u201d. Coffey said Cattle Australia fully supported efforts to reduce methane emissions and climate neutrality \u201cwill be another target along the way\u201d. The organisation plans to raise the issue at Beef Week in Rockhampton this week. Meanwhile, the red meat sector\u2019s net zero target is being marketed to consumers. MLA presented it at Cop28 in Dubai last month. Splitting the target Prof Myles Allen is the head of atmospheric, oceanic and planetary physics at the University of Oxford and chief architect of the methane model on which the climate neutral target is based. He said separately reporting cumulative and short-lived pollutants was \u201csomething the entire climate [science] community agrees on\u201d. Allen and other climate scientists who spoke to Guardian Australia said industries should adopt separate targets for each greenhouse gas emitted based on their varying impact on global heating. In practice, this would mean adopting a \u201csplit target\u201d, Howden said. CO2 emissions need to be reduced to net zero, methane by about two-thirds, and nitrous oxide by about 40% in the long term. \u201cThat\u2019s a really important difference,\u201d Howden said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the technologies to go net zero in agriculture but we do have the technologies and management to make a significant reduction.\u201d Julia Waite, the MLA\u2019s carbon neutral 2030 program manager, said adopting a split or net zero target ultimately would not change MLA\u2019s $152m co-investments in emissions reduction technologies. Coffey says split targets are \u201cpart of the conversation\u201d.

The industry body announced the goal in 2017 and has promoted it to both regulators and consumers, so far investing $180m towards research and development for ways to cut emissions associated with animal production to net zero. A 2022 CSIRO report commissioned by MLA found the industry emitted almost two-thirds the volume of greenhouse gases in 2020 compared with a 2005 baseline.   Related: Breeding the perfect Australian sheep: \u2018You recognise the elite ones right away\u2019    But it said the reported reductions have been driven by a decrease in land clearing and an increase in forest regrowth, as recorded by Australia\u2019s national carbon accounting system. An analysis by the University of Queensland said the NCAS may be grossly under-reporting land clearing rates. In Queensland, where more than 40% of the national cattle herd resides, the 2020-21 statewide landcover and trees study reported significantly higher rates of deforestation than the NCAS data. About 89% of land clearing was attributed to livestock operations.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  MLA\u2019s environmental sustainability manager, Margaret Jewell, said the 2030 target was encouraging the industry to consider and reduce their environmental impact. \u201cThe important thing about the target is that its aligning the industry on committing to continued improvement in sustainability and motivated investment,\u201d Jewell said. Jewell said MLA is confident in the baseline data, but added: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a pretty big level of error because you are trying to do an industry analysis.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the macro dataset that is enabling us to track the biophysical progress of our industry towards a target,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been extremely transparent with that methodology.\u201d The CSIRO report also noted that while emissions were 6.4% lower in 2020 compared with the year prior, this was due to a reduction in livestock numbers. It said if livestock numbers increase, emissions would too. In 2020 the national herd size \u2013 including roughly 2 million dairy cattle that are excluded from the red meat industry\u2019s emissions \u2013 was 24.6 million. By 2023 it had grown to 28.7 million. Investment in emissions reduction technologies have focused on finding ways of reducing the quantity of methane released by burping cattle, which is the largest source of the sector\u2019s emissions. This includes feeding cows seaweed based additives, but one of the longest commercial trials failed to meet hoped-for methane cuts and led to the animals eating less food. Jewell said the research was in its infancy and has had \u201cslightly inconsistent\u201d results. \u201cThe industry needs technology that almost makes sense to adopt regardless of whether they reduce methane or not, but because they have a productivity advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe commercial viability of those [food additives] means they are not something likely to be widely adopted by the industry.\u201d   Related: Australian trial of seaweed cow feed fails to achieve hoped-for methane cuts    Prof Mark Howden, the director of the Australian National University Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, said the sector\u2019s net zero target is \u201ceffectively not possible\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty well embedded in the public consciousness that red meat is high profile in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per serve,\u201d Howden said. \u201cI suspect the industry saw this as a fundamental threat to their future \u2026 A few years ago everybody was kind of jumping on the net zero bandwagon without actually thinking through what it actually meant,\u201d he said. The CSIRO found the industry would fall short of meeting its net zero target, and instead recommended the adoption of a \u201cclimate-neutral\u201d target that would require a reduction of methane emissions rather their complete elimination.

Last year, the standing committee on agriculture\u2019s final report into food security, chaired by Labor MP Meryl Swanson, recommended a National Food Plan. It also called for a strategy to address the decline in milk production because a strong dairy industry was required for the \u201cnutritional and food security\u201d of the nation. Dairy was one of only two industries, the other being seafood, that were singled out for special attention in the report. Milk is one of those staple products that most people assume Australia has covered. Well, yes and no. Dairying used to be a protected industry. Then came industry deregulation in 2000; the rise of dairy alternatives such as oat, soy and almond milk; and the milk price wars initiated by the supermarket duopoly in 2011 \u2013 those same supermarkets that have appeared before a Senate committee in the past week.    It would appear that the industry has decided this shrinking pool in Australia is the new normal    In the last few years, something more complex has been happening for the people who make your milk, yoghurt, cheese and butter. A mandatory code of conduct governing behaviour between processors and farmers has provided more certainty for farmers on price. The national dairy herd has been in decline. And dairy farmers received record high prices in 2023 for their milk because Australia\u2019s total milk production was falling. It follows then that Australia had record dairy imports in the past two years, as outlined in a Rabobank report in February. In 2023, Australia imported the equivalent of the annual milk production in NSW and Queensland combined. Meanwhile, dairy processors are shutting factories to readjust to the decline in milk and herd numbers. It is not hard to see where this story is going.   Related: Watchdog will \u2018regret\u2019 letting Coles buy milk processing plants, dairy industry representatives say    This month, the world\u2019s largest dairy company, the French company Lactalis, announced it would close its Echuca dairy factory while upgrading its Bendigo factory. Seventy jobs are at stake. In February, Bega announced the consolidation of its plants in Tasmania.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  It would appear that the industry has decided this shrinking pool in Australia is the new normal. Like New Zealand, Australia may have reached \u201cpeak milk\u201d. But it\u2019s complex. Australia sends 30% of its dairy products overseas at the same time as we shoppers rely more on imported dairy. Australian dairy manufacturers also rely on imports to produce other dairy products. Half of our imports come from New Zealand, followed by the EU and the United States. Industry analysts such as Rabobank\u2019s Michael Harvey, author of the report, predict imports will \u201cplay a more significant role in the domestic supply chain\u201d as we adjust to the shrinking milk pool. That means more imported dairy on our shelves. Rabobank data from Coles online in January this year shows the two cheapest retail butter products (Westgold and Coles Salted Butter) were both imported. For Australian shoppers with tight budgets, that makes them appealing products. For Australian dairy farmers though it also means \u2013 in the words of the Coles jingle \u2013 \u201cdown, down, prices are down\u201d. Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences forecasts by Alistair Read show farmgate milk prices will fall 6% in 2024-2025 and he expects total milk production to continue its decline as herd numbers drop, perhaps fuelled by higher farmland prices and diversification of former dairy-only farms. Dairy farming is hard work, harder than a number of other agricultural enterprises, and dairy farmers are starting to look for greener pastures. Of course this is just the market doing its thing. Indeed, that was the rationale for dairy deregulation in the first place. Nearly a generation after the deregulation began, the political context gets more interesting, for two reasons. Firstly, Anthony Albanese\u2019s re-election plan appears to hinge on a more interventionist manufacturing policy, one in which he uses \u201csharper elbows when it comes to marking out our national interest\u201d. His Future Made In Australia Act, if passed, appears to pull together existing initiatives and new ones, including on jobs, skills, wages, the net zero agenda, infrastructure and science capability. He says it will boost smart manufacturing capability and economic sovereignty. \u201cThis is not old-fashioned protectionism or isolationism \u2013 it is the new competition,\u201d he says. The context is that governments in other countries \u2013 he names the US, the EU, Japan and Korea \u2013 are doing the same because the global security environment has changed. Like spooky horses, voters are calmed by economic and national sovereignty agendas when global tensions arise. It is no surprise that, two years after the pandemic, governments are thinking about shorter supply chains and critical industries. Frankly, they would have rocks in their head if they were not. Secondly, we are watching the CEOs of the supermarket duopoly, Coles and Woolworths, answer questions about concentration in the market, price setting and profiteering. The duopoly provides a regular reminder that concentration in markets can make our systems weaker and leaves all those who deal with big players at their mercy. Companies naturally want to increase their market share. So where does food fit into Labor\u2019s sovereign capability agenda? If dairy herds keep declining and dairy farms continue to concentrate, our milk supply could be one example of a critical product in need of some attention.

[2024-01-03T14:00:05Z]": "Regional Australia\u2019s back yards and nature strips need more trees to combat extreme heat and make rural towns more livable, experts say. Increasing shade cover in cities and towns can dramatically reduce surface temperatures and encourage walking and cycling. But as many metropolitan councils set ambitious tree canopy targets, budget constraints, fewer incentives and social attitudes mean some regional areas are lagging behind. Dr Laurel Johnson from the University of Queensland says increasing tree canopy cover in regional towns is one of the few tools available to ameliorate extreme summer temperatures exacerbated by global heating. \u201cWhen there are more days over 40C, your tree canopy becomes really critical in cooling a township,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cWe are sort of in tune with that phenomenon in more urbanised areas but regional towns don\u2019t seem to be.\u201d Awnings and street trees provide shade and create a welcoming environment for pedestrians, Johnson says, but they are often confined to the high street. \u201cIf you then need to walk to another part of town, you\u2019ll find yourself quickly exposed to the elements,\u201d she says. Johnson says the prioritisation of cars over public transport and pathways for pedestrians in many regional towns mean the benefits of street trees have not been fully realised.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cRegional towns are much more concerned with the quality of the bitumen,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThat will trump tree planting every time.\u201d More space, more resistance Landscape restoration projects in regional areas can initially be met with strong community opposition, says Greening Australia Queensland program officer Freddy Herrera. \u201cYou have this fightback of people thinking that you\u2019re just going to make everything bush,\u201d Herrera says. \u201cHaving been part of a regional community you understand it \u2013 it\u2019s almost an attitude of: \u2018We have always done it this way, why change?\u2019\u201d Herrera says community consultation and a fire management plan were a vital part of getting approval for a project outside Gatton in Queensland\u2019s Lockyer Valley, where the not-for-profit planted native shrubs and trees along an eroded creek. But he says the town does not have a broader strategy to increase the urban canopy. \u201cIn rural areas you have more space [for trees] but you are fighting a bit of resistance,\u201d Herrera says. \u201cIn the cities you have mostly positive attitudes but you are constricted by space.\u201d   Related:How can cities help trees survive extreme heat?    West of Gatton, on the Darling Downs, tree planting efforts have been mixed. The Toowoomba regional council has planted tens of thousands of trees on council land and distributed thousands more free tree vouchers to residents, resulting in an estimated 2% to 5% increase in the urban canopy since 2011.  In the neighbouring Western Downs regional council, 8,000 trees have been planted on kerbs since 2017 as part of an \u201cadopt a tree\u201d program. But to the south, the Goondiwindi regional council said while it is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of its tree-lined streets, it doesn\u2019t have a plan to increase its urban canopy. In the Southern Downs regional council there had been no effort to increase the number of trees until December 2023, when the council announced it had secured a $100k federal government grant to plant trees. Prof Thomas Astell-Burt from the University of Wollongong says the percentage of tree canopy cover can vary widely between council areas. In the Sydney suburb of Ryde, tree canopy has decreased from 40% to 33% in seven years due in part to a large number of subdivisions in the area. In the regional city of Wollongong, the council has set an ambitious target to increase urban canopy cover to 34% by 2037. It\u2019s currently estimated at just 17%. Astell-Burt says tree preservation is just as important as planting new trees, to avoid an overall decrease in canopy growth overtime. And he says the benefits go beyond shade: \u201cTree-lined streets present opportunities for serendipitous conversations with neighbours that in turn builds social capital, improves mental health and reduces loneliness.\u201d    \u2018Easily a null issue\u2019 Dr Jennifer Kent from the University of Sydney says many of the arguments for increasing urban tree canopy cover \u2013 namely the health benefits of regularly interacting with nature and parkland \u2013 are less persuasive in regional areas than in large cities because there is easier access to natural bushland.   Related: Purple people pleasers: jacarandas burst into bloom after record-breaking rains     \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be a good thing to plant trees,\u201d Kent says. \u201cBut regional areas are quite often really well endowed with public open spaces \u2013 I can see how from a policy perspective it\u2019s slipped off the radar a bit.\u201d The layout of regional towns, with fewer buildings spaced further apart, also lessens the impact of urban heat islands, which have been a major driver of ambitious urban tree planting programs, Kent says.  It is also harder to persuade people to switch from cars to walking or cycling in regional towns, despite the shorter distances traversed, because the lack of traffic and availability of parking makes them the \u201cperfect environment\u201d for car dependency. Ian Plowman, a former psychologist and social researcher, said land ballots conducted throughout the 20th century \u2013 where crown land was handed out to prospective farmers on the condition it was clearcut and productive \u2013 may also have shaped the perception of large-scale tree-planting projects in regional Australia. \u201cIn regional areas, do people find trees appealing, or do they signal a loss of productivity?\u201d he says.

A University of Adelaide study, published in the journal Nature Food, modelled the impact an average temperature increase of 1C and 3C would have on Australia\u2019s $4.3bn sheep industry. An estimated 2.1 million potential lambs are currently lost annually due to heat stress, the study said. If temperatures were to rise by 3C, that number would rise to 3.3 million.

Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  In two previous Australian studies referenced in the report, heat stress reduced the lambing rate (the number of lambs born per one hundred ewes mated) by 3.5% for each additional day over 32.2C. Extreme heat also decreased a ram\u2019s sperm quality and impaired foetal development. \u201cWhen it\u2019s hotter ewes have fewer lambs,\u201d Van Wettere said. \u201cThen there is the effect of heat during pregnancy that results in smaller lambs which are less likely to survive.\u201d Notably, the report did not model a decrease in the availability and quality of livestock feed and water due to global heating, which would likely exacerbate adverse effects of heat stress. Australia has the second-highest sheep population in the world, with a national flock of 72 million in 2024, according to estimates by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences. However, like the size of the country\u2019s cattle herd, these figures are based on survey data which some experts say is inaccurate. The director of the South Australian Drought Hub, Stephen Lee, said feed supplements, selective breeding and more shade cover would allow sheep to adapt to a warming climate. \u201cHeat stress on sheep production is very significant and predicted to increase,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also something we have the agency to address.\u201d The chief executive of Farmers for Climate Action, Natalie Collard, said the report was a \u201cpowerful example\u201d of how global heating is affecting Australian agriculture. \u201cAll of us in the farming sector need to reduce our carbon footprint so we can protect our food supply and the viability of our businesses in the long term,\u201d Collard said.

A team from the National Fire Ant Eradication Program was at the site by Wednesday morning, with emergency measures put in place by Thursday. \nAccording to the program\u2019s fire ant map, the ants were found on an army aviation base about 4km from Oakey Creek, a tributary of the Condamine River. The program has not confirmed the number of nests at the site and is conducting genetic testing on the population. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThose results will reveal whether the ants are linked to the ongoing and extensive south-east Queensland outbreak or had newly arrived in the country, possibly by plane. \n\u201cWe are prioritising eradication activities in Oakey,\u201d a program spokesperson said. \u201cOur dedicated teams were on the ground over the weekend and the intensive surveillance and treatment will continue this week.\u201d \nRed imported fire ants were first detected in Queensland in 2001 and can kill people, native animals and livestock as well as damage infrastructure and ecosystems and have infested more than 700,000 hectares in the Brisbane area. \nThey have the ability to form rafts, joining together to float and survive flood waters. Farmers have long feared that a fire ant incursion to the Murray Darling catchment area could, because of the pest\u2019s river rafting capabilities, speed up their spread. \nThe chair of NSW Farmers\u2019 biosecurity committee, Ian McColl, said the new detection \u201cis the first time that we\u2019re aware that it has been found in areas where it has the potential to get into the Murray Darling river system\u201d. \n \n  Related: Fire ants detected south of Byron Bay after gardener raises alarm  \n \n\u201cThat takes the whole level of risk to another level.\u201d \nAs well Queensland, the detection had the potential to affect New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, he said. \nAbout 40% of Australia\u2019s farms are located in the Murray Darling Basin.

That\u2019s really the question,\u201d McColl said. \nAdvocacy manager for the Invasive Species Council, Reece Pianta, said fire ants were unlikely to be able to raft from the Oakey site, but that the detection was significant. \n\u201cThis new detection outside the fire ant eradication zone and within the Murray Darling Basin catchment should mean alarm bells are ringing loudly in the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d he said. \n \n  Related: Australian $1.2bn program to eradicate red fire ants is a \u2018shambles\u2019, Senate inquiry told  \n \n\u201cIt is a significant infestation \u2026 The question it raises is how many undetected fire ants nests are out there,\u201d he said. \nBoth the council and the program are urging residents in Queensland and NSW to look for and report fire ants. \n\u201cWorking together is key to eradicating fire ants from Australia for good, once and for all,\u201d the program spokesperson said. \nThe detection was confirmed the day before the Senate\u2019s Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee released its report into red imported fire ants in Australia. \nA month after the conclusion of three days of public hearings, the committee made 10 recommendations, including a funding review, public awareness campaign, the establishment of a cooperative research centre and an independent review of the current response to fire ants. \nIt warned Australia could face annual losses of $2bn if fire ants were to become widespread. \n\u201cThe report makes it clear that the government needs to do more to repair the damage done by past fire ant failures,\u201d said Pianta. \n\u201cThe government that lets fire ants spread will be judged harshly by future Australians.\u201d", "Steven Miles to set more ambitious emissions reduction targets on day one as Queensland premier [2023-12-14T14:00:03Z]": "The incoming Queensland premier, Steven Miles, is expected to announce on Friday that the state will lift its lagging emissions reductions targets, among a number of \u201cday one\u201d initiatives to be unveiled by the new state leadership.

It\u2019s the Hazards Near Me app notification on my mobile phone, and it\u2019s ringing in a new national approach to disaster warnings. It has been four years since the 2019-20 bushfires and the Australian landscape is almost as tinder-dry as it was then. There are fires burning across the east coast, including in the northern New South Wales region of New England where I live. I can\u2019t decide whether this new software sounds like the chime of a dull bell or an electronic water droplet from a 1980s video game. But it\u2019s a welcome addition to the soundscape. My phone has been chiming multiple times a day this past week, informing me of fires within a 50km radius of my home at Deepwater, between Glen Innes and Tenterfield. I\u2019ve configured the settings that way, because when I smell or see smoke I want to know everything.   Related: Almost 2,000 fire trucks in NSW don\u2019t meet safety standards, as state faces daunting bushfire season    Sometimes the chimes come in a row, most often in the morning before I turn on the news. They echo on my husband\u2019s phone but we\u2019re learning to accept this daily cacophony as a timely update direct from our emergency services. Very often this tuneless electronica means a series of fires have been downgraded, according to the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System. Other times, a lone chime signals that a blaze in our warning zone has escalated. Discordant trills might cut through work and other plans we\u2019ve made for the day but this new system already feels like a vast improvement on the sense of powerlessness that black summer delivered \u2013 especially, as happened this week, it tells us an out-of-control fire has ignited just a few kilometres from our home.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  During similar circumstances in the 2019-20 summer, I trawled through multiple online sources trying to piece together a picture of the three major fires that encircled our town. That season the NSW Rural Fire Service app, then called just Fires Near Me, took a long time to update. It was hard to see how fast a fire was spreading, and in which direction or how far. More often than not I stood on our front deck and looked to the smoke-filled skies because, ironically, they delivered a clearer picture. But this week, with several fires encircling Deepwater since Friday, the upgraded Hazards Near Me app appears to be delivering enough detail to keep the community well informed. Of course it\u2019s only as good as mobile signal allows, which is not always great in the bush. It\u2019s part of a new emergency messaging system for fires, floods and public safety crises announced in May by the federal emergency services minister, Murray Watt. It\u2019s too early to know how well the system worked when, with incredible speed and ferocity, bushfires burned vast chunks of the region directly to our north this week around the border towns of Jennings-Wallangarra between NSW and Queensland, and beyond to Warwick. Four years ago, such interstate blazes didn\u2019t show on the NSW app but the new version is covering the entire cross-border situation. Border communities have a love/hate relationship with the invisible lines that separate us. Very often we have family on both sides and regularly cross to do business and travel for medical appointments, so when bushfires happen on either side of our state border they impact communities up and down the New England Highway that links us. In February 2019, while driving south from a work meeting west of Toowoomba, a large fire was burning along the border in the ridges above Wallangarra-Jennings. As I arrived at the crossing \u2013 marked by little more than a bend in the road and a sign for the first pub in NSW \u2013 residents were pouring out of homes into their yards and on to the streets, watching a vast cloud of smoke up in the bush.   Related: Queensland experiencing \u2018one or two\u2019 out-of-control bushfires every day, firefighters say    In the wake of that devastating blaze, word went around the community that firefighters and administrators of the NSW RFS and the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services had struggled to work together. It was barely reported beyond the local newspaper but the principle formed part of the 67th recommendation of the report released in July 2020 after the NSW bushfire inquiry, which stated that the RFS should incorporate information on fires in neighbouring states and territories into its app. That recommendation also suggested a national emergency app be developed as part of the new national warning system. It was reassuring this week to hear the premiers of NSW and Queensland pay tribute to the fire services of both states for their work fighting the Wallangarra-Jennings fire.  Annastacia Palaszczuk was specific about the collaboration. \u201cI also want to thank the NSW government because we utilised their large tanker, their large plane, and that has been of tremendous service,\u201d she told the media on Tuesday. The QFES deputy commissioner, Mike Wassing, also spoke of \u201cgreat joint operations with NSW\u201d. That I was able to watch the results unfold on my phone, not quite in real time but close enough, was a great comfort under smoky skies. I imagine it\u2019s similar for the loved ones and friends of firefighting volunteers and employees working on the fire grounds. Now that fire services have responded to some of the recommendations that emerged from the multiple inquiries after black summer, I\u2019d like to see current (and a few former) politicians receive regular tuneless trills on their mobile phones about the warning signs of climate change. An app for that might knock down some of the ideological borders that are blocking meaningful action.

Climate Energy Finance director, Tim Buckley, said the industry requires bipartisan support for long-term planning and security. \u201cThat means it\u2019s got longevity and credibility and therefore it provides the investor certainty that is needed to really underpin the literally hundreds of billions of dollars of investments that are required to make this work,\u201d Buckley said. Advisors won\u2019t have \u2018vested interests\u2019 If legislated, the bill would set a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels, and 75% by 2035. It would then require the minister to set a series of interim targets every five years after 2035 until net zero 2050, a decade in advance. It would also require the government to establish a clean economy expert panel to guide policy development. The panel would develop a series of emissions reduction plans for specific sectors \u2013 for example, energy, transport, agriculture and industry \u2013 by 2025. The minister would have to annually update parliament on progress.  The panel will be required to have at least two but no more than five members appointed by the minister. The state Chief Scientist would automatically be a member. Under the proposed law, those people must have experience or qualifications in the science or economics of climate change or the development of low-emission industries, rural regional development or \u201canother area the minister considered relevant\u201d. Energy minister Mick de Brenni said the government would not appoint representatives of fossil fuel companies or other vested interests to the board. \u201cThey are real experts that will work with us with real strategies, an expert panel that is not made up of vested interests. It won\u2019t be an expert panel that relies on technology that doesn\u2019t exist. It won\u2019t be an expert panel that makes recommendations around over-reliance on offsets,\u201d de Brenni said.    The longer we deny the science, the longer we delay investment in industries of the future.    The premier said the plan would have \u201c an expert panel to guide us on that pathway and a series of sectoral plans so that we are identifying the best, most rational places to do those reductions\u201d. The legislation is officially called the Clean Economy Jobs bill and much of the pitch for the plan is about its purported positive impact on the economy. Introducing the bill on Wednesday, the premier told parliament it would secure \u201cblue collar jobs in our regions in both existing industries and new ones\u201d. \u201cThe targets we\u2019re setting to reduce emissions by 75% by 2035 are based on science and meeting internationally agreed targets,\u201d Miles said. \u201cBut more importantly, they will provide industry with the certainty to invest in converting existing industry to renewables and attracting new industries here. These targets are crucial to lock in the investment needed for our economic future.\u201d The state has already almost achieved its 2030 goal, with current emissions 29% below 2005 levels, he said. The bill will now go to parliament\u2019s Clean Economy Jobs, Resources and Transport Committee for scrutiny.

Seven hundred Angus breeding cows and heifers, reared through a \u201ccarbon-neutral farming system\u201d, went under the hammer at the saleyards in Gloucester, a small town three hours\u2019 drive from Sydney, on Thursday.

The cattle were bred by fourth-generation farmer Robert MacKenzie. \u201cI\u2019m doing it for my family and to show farmers this is achievable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two sons that will eventually take on the business \u2026 they are part of a generation where sustainability matters.\u201d For Australia\u2019s red meat industry, which has set a sector-wide net zero emissions goal by 2030, the sale is an important proof of concept: is producing net zero cattle worth the cost?    How can a live cow be carbon neutral? Well, the individual animal is still making its natural emissions. But it can, theoretically, be embedded within a supply chain that achieves carbon neutrality.

Australian farmers are \u2018flying blind in a low-carbon world\u2019 | Gabrielle Chan    The farm then implemented new management practices including intensive stock rotation, planting a more diverse mix of grass species and targeted organic fertiliser use, which is intended to improve landscape health, boost productivity and increase soil carbon. In 2023, another 1,400 soil samples were taken, showing a 40% average increase in soil carbon, at 540kg Co2 sequestered per hectare. The 2024 results are pending. According to Agricore, this meant the farm had stored more carbon in the ground than the total emissions released by the farm over the same year. This carbon accounting approach is known as \u201cinsetting\u201d, where on-farm carbon sequestration is counted against the farm\u2019s operational emissions to reach net zero. How do you get a farm to net zero? The director of Agricore, Hayden Hollis, said annual soil carbon tests across Mackenzie\u2019s farm were conducted in accordance with Clean Energy Regulator (CER) guidelines. While the regulator\u2019s methodology is widely used by the industry, a consortium of Australian soil scientists have called for flaws in the scheme to be \u201caddressed as a matter of urgency\u201d. Agricore\u2019s data is proprietary and could not be viewed by Guardian Australia. One of those scientists is Dr Elaine Mitchell from the Queensland University of Technology. She says intervals of at least five years are usually required to detect statistically significant soil carbon changes. Prof Richard Eckard, an agricultural economist from the University of Melbourne, said soil carbon should be measured on a 10-year running mean to account for seasonal fluctuations, 70% of which is driven by rainfall patterns.    He said success could not be determined until \u201cyou have ironed out the rainfall variability and reflect what is truly management\u201d. The margin of error in sampling was about 20%, Eckard said, with another 10% variation in laboratory analysis. \u201cAnnual changes in soil carbon are just buried in the noise of error in our ability to measure soil carbon.\u201d Can soil carbon sequestration mitigate livestock emissions? Pastures have the potential to store huge amounts of carbon, but these gains are by no means permanent and slow overtime. Like Macka\u2019s Pastoral, Jigsaw Farms in western Victoria inset its livestock emissions to achieve carbon neutrality, but this was only possible for about seven years. Hollis said Mackenzie\u2019s soil carbon project was in its infancy and would continue to see soil carbon gains. \u201cBut like any landscape, there comes a point where we hit capacity,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s just the reality of it.\u201d Once that occurs, Hollis said, the farm would have to find other ways of insetting or reducing its livestock emissions, such as tree plantings and breeding for faster-growing cattle.  A global study led by Wageningen University in the Netherlands found that under right conditions \u2013 like the high rainfall area where Macka\u2019s Pastoral is based \u2013 short-term data suggests carbon sequestration can be used to mitigate the grazing system emissions.   Related: Saturation point: Australia\u2019s best known carbon-neutral farm can no longer offset its emissions    But it found that over the long term, it is \u201coverly optimistic and could be misleading\u201d and \u201chas a limited role to mitigate climate warming\u201d. Farmers also have the option of using carbon gains to obtain Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) through the CER with the help of a \u201ccarbon developer\u201d. These credits can then be sold and bought by large polluters as offsets to their own Co2 emissions, or used to inset on-farm emissions and become certified carbon neutral by the government\u2019s Climate Active program. There are now 528 soil carbon projects registered under the ACCU scheme, which has received criticism from scientists. So far seven have been issued credits. What\u2019s the market for carbon-neutral cattle? Coles supermarket stocks a small range of carbon-neutral beef and pork bought directly from producers including Jigsaw Farms, which receive a premium price for their cattle. But the sale at Gloucester is the first public cattle auction marketed by a vendor as carbon neutral. Wynand Snyman, the chief executive of Auctions Plus, the online livestock marketplace that hosted the sale, said livestock emissions reporting was in its infancy. The average price across the sale was $1,753 and the highest price, for heifers pregnancy tested in calf, was $4,300. But buyers were largely attracted to the cattle\u2019s genetics, not their carbon footprint. Farmer Bill McDonald bought 13 of Mckenzie\u2019s cows. \u201cThey were good cattle with good genetics at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m working towards being carbon neutral too, so that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Women in power: the push to get more diverse female candidates in Australian elections [2023-11-17T02:01:17Z]": "Almost every council in Australia has a gallery of \u201cdead men\u201d, says Licia Heath.

Scanlon and his wife, Karen, manage the stud on a 970-hectare property called Kenmay near Miriam Vale in central Queensland. It burned on 29 October in the Mount Tom fires. \n\u201cThere were planes, helicopters, red fire trucks and yellow fire trucks, bulldozers, friends and neighbours all helping,\u201d Scanlon says. \u201cThe noise was incredible \u2013 sirens of the helicopters, the roar of the fire \u2013 and the smoke was dense.\u201d \n \n  Related: Heavy rainfalls in Queensland bring cattle prices back up to \u2018expected\u2019 levels  \n \nWhen the smoke cleared, they had lost 92% of their 610 hectares of pasture.

For many graziers the best way to save country, sanity and finances is to de-stock completely. But for seed-stock producers, those whose livelihoods depends on generations of breeding and the development of specialised genetics, the options are more complicated. \n \n Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter \n \nScanlon\u2019s initial reaction to the fire was to partially de-stock, hence the message that made its way across social media and into national headlines.

In Caboolture, a large peri-urban centre on Brisbane\u2019s northern fringe, quarter-acre blocks are connected with a sprawling network of black bitumen roads to ferry families to work, school, the shops and back. It\u2019s a hostile environment for pedestrians and cyclists. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few near misses now,\u201d says Laura Sheather, a mother who lives in Caboolture. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a child dying because we pushed our luck a bit far trying to ride bikes to school.\u201d Sheather\u2019s home is just 1km from her children\u2019s school.

He says that bus services should perform two distinct functions \u2013 assist in mass transit and allow people to explore. \u201cIn the suburbs it\u2019s very expensive to do both, so you find governments try to do both [in one service],\u201d he says. \u201cThe risk is you don\u2019t satisfy anyone.\u201d The result, he says, is transport poverty. \u201cPeople buy a second car because there\u2019s no other way of getting around, but they can\u2019t really afford it so something else has to give.\u201d      Fifty-nine per cent of households in Caboolture have two or more cars \u2013 a higher rate of car ownership than the national average. In Brisbane\u2019s inner-city just 38.4% of households have two cars. The Moreton Bay council, which covers Caboolture, has lobbied for improved bus services but the mayor, Peter Flannery, says it\u2019s a chicken and egg argument. \u201c[They] won\u2019t provide the services unless the demand is there and the demand might not be there unless the services are there,\u201d he says. About 30,000 new homes will be built west of Caboolture over the next 40 years, according to the suburb\u2019s planning scheme. That will require dedicated investment in non-car transport options, Flannery says. \u201cIn the past, active transport was like an added-on extra that you were lucky to get,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s a must in new developments.\u201d Wendy Nash, a Caboolture resident, has been campaigning for greater investment in \u201cactive\u201d transport options, including better cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. \u201cPeople who can afford a car and can drive don\u2019t see the problem, and the people who can\u2019t drive don\u2019t feel like they have a voice,\u201d Nash says. \u201cIf you can build a big road why can\u2019t you build a footpath alongside it?\u201d Dr Laurel Johnson from the University of Queensland says the rising cost of living, growing environmental awareness and rapid population growth are creating a need for alternatives to private cars as the only transport option, which does not fit within car-centric suburban planning. \u201cThere was an assumption that people in an outer suburb will drive and be able to afford vehicles,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cBut a whole lot of externalities have come to bear on us that have changed that.\u201d    She says the historical underinvestment in public infrastructure on city fringes is failing young people. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young person growing up in Caboolture you simply don\u2019t have the same opportunities that you do if you lived in inner-suburban areas,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t get a casual job because you\u2019d have no way to get back from Kmart if you finish at 9 o\u2019clock on a Thursday night. There\u2019s no way to get home.\u201d Kirk Lambie and his wife bought their first home south of Caboolture six years ago. They\u2019ve since had two kids. His first job in the area as a support worker involved a lot of driving, so as the cost of keeping his car on the road rose he began to look for other options. \u201cI just kept looking at the price of fuel \u2026 I was pretty much driving all the time and the reimbursement rate wasn\u2019t catching up,\u201d Lambie says. He now works as a cleaner at a local aged care facility. The commute is 10 minutes by bicycle. It has allowed him to spend more time with his kids at home and he\u2019s considering selling the family\u2019s second car.  \u201cIt\u2019s also the interactions you make riding a push-bike,\u201d he says. \u201cI see people out walking now and say G\u2019day.

There are obvious power structures, such as the council and its councillors or the local member and their political party. In the bush, it is usually a Liberal or a National MP. That power comes with a lick of government funding and a foot in an influential door. Then there are the cliques that wield power by dint of influence or relationships with the public office holders. These might include the hospital board, the progress association or even the footy club. These bush influencers work in sync with the obvious power figures. This is human nature. You scratch my back and I will bark, as my grandmother used to say.   Related: Climate crisis could contribute to a global food shortage by 2050, US special envoy on food security warns     Those power structures are hard to crack or subvert. And when you have lived somewhere for many decades, as I have, it can be hard to see how power could be exerted any differently. But halfway through this 47th parliamentary term, I got a reminder that changes can be so subtle that it\u2019s easy to miss them. Two weeks ago, we covered a meeting of Darling Downs farmers who are fighting against coal seam gas expansion by Arrow Energy. Those farmers came to hear speakers ranging from independent ACT senator David Pocock to environmental lawyers, agricultural scientists and ecosystem specialists. It mimicked a similar event on the Liverpool Plains earlier this year, which saw teal independents invited up from Sydney to try to garner their support against Santos\u2019 gas exploration project. The Darling Downs meeting was organised by Suzie Holt, a former independent candidate for the federal seat of Groom. She worked with Cecil Plains farmer Liza Balmain, whose property is affected by the gas expansion. Back in 2022, Holt shocked everyone at the federal election by coming second, largely off the back of preferences, to the LNP member, Garth Hamilton, in a crowded field. Hamilton is on the right of the party but on the morning after the surprising result he wrote in a statement to the local paper: \u201cIt is important now that my party acknowledges the result and sets about restoring our credibility as the home of sensible, centre-right policy. We\u2019ve much work to do.\u201d Holt is a former social worker, but leans progressive in a conservative country kind of way. Since the election she has called herself a regional community advocate. She has used the increased profile of her strong result at the polls to connect people and open doors. Hence the meeting on the black soil paddocks at the Cecil Plains west of Toowoomba.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Among the invitations were politicians of all stripes. She named the politicians who had showed interest (Condamine LNP state MP Pat Weir attended). She named those who had sent apologies (Queensland agriculture minister Mark Furner and Warrego LNP state MP Ann Leahy) and those who had not responded (federal Nationals leader David Littleproud). The Cecil Plains farm neighbours Littleproud\u2019s seat of Maranoa, the safest federal conservative seat, held on 22% even after the Labor landslide. Holt told me afterwards that she had not stopped this sort of work, since the election, though she has yet to decide whether to run again. \u201cThe fact that we did so well has enabled me to have that opportunity and those doors open,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was happy to use that to see if we can create change. That soft power, whatever you want to call it, that ability to open those doors for the better of our community.\u201d Her profile is such that someone walked up to her recently and told her how disappointed they were that she had not done more since being in government. Holt had to inform the voter that she was not the local representative.   Related: Livestock prices plummet as Australian farmers prepare for drought     The whole event made me wonder whether there might be a new movement happening that does not require one to hold office to have influence. Independent MPs in rural areas have been far less numerous than the teal city independents who crowded into the crossbench after the 2022 election. That is despite the origins of the \u201cVoices For\u201d model as the lead-up to Cathy McGowan\u2019s 2013 election to the Victorian federal rural seat of Indi, where the baton has since passed to fellow independent Helen Haines. A rural independent candidate who came close to toppling a Nationals-endorsed candidate was Rob Priestly in the seat of Nicholls, which borders Indi and is centred around the northern Victorian town of Shepparton. He said after his tilt at federal politics he has discovered a freedom to create change in a way that is harder for a public figure. His efforts have so far focused on water reform and  the Indigenous voice to parliament, among other things. \u201cI am not accountable to everyone, I can just go out and do what\u2019s right \u2013 which is really about your own core beliefs for your community,\u201d Priestly said. But while parliament and local government may not come with ultimate freedom it does come with clear lines of power. On that score, Priestly has made it clear he is not running at the next federal election. Holt, at this stage, is not prepared to say. But they are interesting case studies on the rural political landscape, in this lull between the tumult and shouting of election times. And, as they show, losing the battle may not always mean losing the influence.", "Lightning Ridge residents push to rename road after fallen firefighter Leo Fransen  [2024-01-17T14:00:31Z]": "Opal mining communities in north-western New South Wales are petitioning to rename one of the region\u2019s main roads after a volunteer firefighter who died trying to save homes from bushfires. Leo Fransen, the captain of the Diamond Beach rural fire service, almost 700km south-east of the opal mining town, died in the Hudson fire which burned through 22,000 hectares and destroyed 12 homes in the area around Lightning Ridge in November last year. The 75-year-old was struck by a falling tree on the fire ground on 16 November. He was part of a strike team sent to the area to tackle the fire, which was then threatening the Glengarry opal fields, about 70km from Lightning Ridge.

Flags flew at half-mast at the local war memorial and his funeral was livestreamed at the Glengarry Hilton, an open-air pub in the mining town. A petition has been launched for the Walgett Shire Council to rename Grawin Road, the main road leading into the fields, to Capt. Leo Fransen Way, and a plaque will be set among the war memorial grounds as a permanent commemoration.    Residents of the remote Grawin, Glengarry and Sheepyard opal fields, west of Lightning Ridge, are an independent lot. Miners are used to hard work and to solving whatever problem presents itself.

Supermarkets donated bottled water, opal buyers auctioned black opal and donated the proceeds, and the butcher shop, opened only three weeks prior, provided meat. Part-time opal miners offered emergency accommodation to those who had lost their homes.

The plane is part of an international aerial firefighting support arrangement, on secondment from British Columbia with Conair Canada.

He was met by a packed crowd at the Glengarry Hilton, all of whom wanted to shake his hand or buy him a beer. \u201cI saw all the damage and my heart sank to see how close [the fire] had come to homes,\u201d he says. \u201cOne lady told me how all she could see were flames and smoke around her house and then she saw my plane come over [to save it].

MacLeod, newspaper publisher turned soil carbon entrepreneur, is talking about soil carbon sequestration, which he is pitching as a solution to both decarbonising the agriculture industry and aiding in keeping global heating below 1.5C. The problem is the science does not currently support its long-term use.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  To livestock producers, MacLeod says, soil carbon represents \u201ca market opportunity\u201d which can be seized \u201calongside a profitable, efficient, farming business\u201d. It\u2019s that proposition \u2013 and the promise of significant profits \u2013 which has brought beef producers, industry groups and a few environmentalists to the sixth annual field day of Wilmot farm, McLeod\u2019s flagship property 600km north of Sydney. It\u2019s the perfect setting for the pitch. In 2021, Microsoft brought about US$1m in carbon credits from the 8,000ha rolling cattle pastures and three other properties owned by MacLeod.    \u201cWe blazed the trail for on-farm carbon sequestration,\u201d MacLeod says. Microsoft bought from one other soil carbon offset project in the same year, as part of its commitment to be carbon negative by 2030. In a review of both of purchases it said the soil carbon market is relatively immature and removal estimates are dependent on suitable measurement methodologies. Wilmot said all contracts and agreements associated with the deal remain in place. However, a group of Australian scientists found the recorded soil carbon rise at Wilmot, which was measured by a voluntary international scheme, to be \u201cfar too optimistic\u201d. Carbon Plan, the US based non-for-profit which was contracted by Microsoft to audit the scheme, also found it lacked integrity. Later, MacLeod tells Guardian Australia the Microsoft deal was struck in the infancy of carbon markets, and acknowledges that the methodology used can be improved. He says Wilmot remains \u201ccompletely comfortable\u201d with the deal.    \u2018Carbon developers\u2019 At last year\u2019s field day, MacLeod launched Atlas Carbon, a \u201ccarbon developer\u201d which advises farmers through the lengthy and complex process of obtaining carbon credits. Farmers can sign up to a 25-year carbon project and have soil carbon analysed and measured, for a fee. If they receive credits, the developers take a cut. MacLeod says it allows farmers to capitalise on the window of opportunity to receive large payouts on the carbon credit market, while also encouraging better land management. The aim is to secure Australian Carbon Credit Units through Australia\u2019s Clean Energy Regulator, which have received some criticism but have a better reputation than those used in the Microsoft deal.  As of February 2024 there are 528 soil carbon projects regulated with CER, of which seven have been issued credits currently worth almost $10m. But a consortium of Australian soil scientists, including Dr Elaine Mitchell, an independent consultant who presented at Wilmot open day this week, has called for the regulator to urgently address flaws in scheme. Between 70 and 80% of fluctuations in soil carbon are driven by rainfall, and Mitchell says \u201ca lot of recent issuances [of credits\u2019] were the product of good climatic conditions\u201d. \u201cLand management was a factor, but rainfall overrides that,\u201d she says. Mitchell says there is some evidence that soil carbon can be sequestered in Australia in the long term, but more data is needed. One of the longest running soil carbon study in Australia conducted by the NSW Department of Primary Industry found a significant increase in soil carbon five years after new grazing techniques were implemented. But after 10 years, at four of six sites that recorded increases, nearly all soil carbon that had been gained was lost back into the atmosphere. Greg Ward, a cattle producer has been to all six Wilmot open days and is in the early stages of soil project with a carbon developer. \u201cIt just feels good. You see the soil and biodiversity improvements on the farm,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we happen to make money out of it that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d Emeritus Prof Robert White, of University of Melbourne has worked in soil science for over 50 years. He says global heating is making it more difficult to sequester soil carbon in the long term, as many Australian landscapes become hotter and drier. But he says increasing soil carbon improves soil fertility and ecology, resilience to extreme weather, and water holding capacity \u2013 all of which increase productivity. Instead of selling carbon credits, he says farmers should focus on \u201cinsetting\u201d \u2013 counting carbon sequestration against their farm\u2019s emissions. That will reduce the emissions intensity of their products which can be sold to retailers like Woolworths, which are increasingly demanding lower emissions product to meet their own net zero emissions targets. \u201c[Carbon developers] are not selling farmers the idea of offsetting their own operations because that doesn\u2019t bring them any money,\u201d he says. \u201cFarmers can do that themselves.\u201d    \u2018Ahead of the science\u2019 At Wilmot, the demonstration continues. In a paddock of Angus cattle, Wilmot Farms general manager, Stuart Austin, holds a shovelful of the soil to the sun. \u201cWe\u2019re ahead of the science,\u201d he says. \u201cThe soil science community is behind, they are hindering progress.\u201d He says he\u2019s confident Wilmot\u2019s soils sequester enough carbon to offset livestock emissions and sell carbon credits. White says this scenario is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d. A 2017 global review that drew on 300 studies concluded soil carbon sequestration can offset just 20-60% of the greenhouse gases released by the animals on the land, making a \u201cnegligible dent\u201d in overall livestock emissions. More recently, a study by Australia\u2019s leading soil scientists found that soil carbon is \u201cunlikely to be a cornerstone strategy\u201d in offsetting livestock emissions because of factors including slowing rates of sequestration over time, its vulnerability to seasonal fluctuations and monitoring difficulty. Tom Archer, who attended the open day, last year became the first Australian farmer to receive carbon credits from the CER after his Queensland property recorded a large increase in soil carbon over five years. He says there is now a far greater incentive for farmers to start carbon credit projects than sell low emissions beef into supply chains. \u201cWhat are we going to do with an inset on our product?\u201d he says. \u201cAll that\u2019s doing is costing us money unless we can find a premium for the product.\u201d He says there is some uncertainty as to what will happen over the course of the project if the property\u2019s soil carbon levels decrease. \u201cIt has a 25-year timeline, so it probably won\u2019t be my problem by then, but definitely, it\u2019s a risk.\u201d    \u2018Incomparable timelines\u2019 Danny Cullenward, a University of Pennsylvania climate economist, was part of the Carbon Plan team that audited the soil carbon measurement methodology used at Wilmot. \u201cCarbon needs to stay put for hundreds of thousands of years if you are trying to match the timeframe of the consequences of burning C02, not just the length of a few decades-long carbon project\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something fundamentally incomparable about those two timeframes.\u201d The chief executive of Atlas Carbon, Ashley Silver, says carbon credits provide incentives for farmers to adopt more sustainable practices with the added benefit of carbon sequestration. The start-up has strict requirements to ensure the properties it works with have the right soil types and at least about 500mm in annual rainfall to ensure carbon storage is long term. \u201cThe next 10 years is probably the big window of soil carbon projects coming to fruition,\u201d Silver says. \u201cIn the future \u2026 it could just become a standard expectation versus something you have to incentivise for.\u201d Cullenward says the agricultural sector has been one the most resistant to direct emissions reduction regulation, and that incentive schemes like the one being pushed by Atlas Carbon can delay climate action. \u201cThere is no world in which we stabilise temperatures by selling others the right to pollute,\u201d he says.

It comes amid speculation that Asia-based private equity firm PAG, which funded Rex\u2019s $150m expansion to jet operations, was considering becoming the airline\u2019s new owner out of administration. Hours after Ernst &amp; Young announced that all Rex Boeing 737 flights between capital cities were grounded, employees at the nation\u2019s third-largest airline were told those flights would cease to operate, according to the Transport Workers Union (TWU).   Related: Rex has entered voluntary administration. What happens next to the embattled regional airline?    Employees were also told that winding up Rex\u2019s jet operations between cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane had resulted in 360 immediate redundancies, the TWU said. As many as 250 further jobs could be axed from across the airline company \u2013 which employed about 2,000 people \u2013 with administrators hoping to confirm final job loss figures within 24-48 hours. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, called it \u201canother dark day for aviation, with over 600 families faced with sudden joblessness in an industry that has taken hit after hit\u201d. Kaine said the union had been working to secure job opportunities at other airlines and aviation companies for ground crew, cabin crew and pilots and \u201chad positive conversations with Virgin Australia and ground handler Dnata\u201d. The United Services Union (USU), whose members include customer service staff at Rex, claimed administrators had told some workers they would miss out on legal entitlements \u2013 like their latest paycheque \u2013 despite the airline continuing to trade. Graeme Kelly, USU general secretary, said: \u201cAs late as the weekend, workers were working overtime and on RDOs when Rex bosses must have known they fully intended to sack them, and would try and get out of paying [them], it\u2019s absolutely outrageous.\u201d Samuel Freeman, one of the Rex administrators, did not respond directly to the USU\u2019s claim, but told Guardian Australia some workers\u2019 entitlements may only be paid if a buyer was found. \u201cIf there\u2019s a deed of company arrangement that eventuates from administration then I anticipate entitlements will be dealt with through that process, and if not, there\u2019s the government\u2019s fair entitlements guarantee,\u201d Freeman said, referencing the scheme in which Bonza\u2019s employees claimed unpaid wages after the carrier\u2019s liquidation.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Fallout from the turmoil at Rex continued on Wednesday morning, with politicians around the country pleading with the Albanese government to ensure the airline\u2019s key regional routes operated by its fleet of 36-seater Saab 340 turboprop aircraft \u2013 which the administrator has insisted would continue to operate \u2013 do not close. Virgin Australia offered some Rex customers the opportunity to rebook on their own flights, free of charge. Qantas and Jetstar have since echoed these offers. All three airlines have also discussed taking on axed Rex staff. Virgin is also understood to be taking over the leases of three Rex 737 jets, and has said it will also explore selling tickets to Rex\u2019s regional services through codeshare agreements. The government has indicated it will ensure the airline\u2019s regional operations continue to exist in some capacity. The government hinted it could look to take a stake in the airline, something the TWU and the Greens have called for. The transport minister, Catherine King, said her department had been in discussions with the administrators about supporting Rex overnight and into Wednesday. \u201cRex is an important airline for regional and remote communities and Rex\u2019s continuation is in the best interests of regional Australians, the travelling public, its workers and the aviation sector,\u201d King said. Freeman said the grounding of Rex\u2019s jet operations was a \u201cpermanent decision\u201d and that he was hopeful of finding a buyer for what would be a restructured airline returning to its legacy form of just regional routes. Freeman said administrators would examine a range of issues, including Rex\u2019s leadership \u2013 where boardroom tensions intensified in the lead-up to entering administration \u2013 as well as problems with its ageing Saab 340 fleet, pilot shortages, and load factors on its jet operations between major cities. Bridget McKenzie, the opposition transport spokesperson, criticised Labor for failing to implement reforms that smaller airlines such as the now defunct Bonza, Rex and competition advocates had called for, including changes to the legislation that governs access to Sydney airport, after allegations Qantas and Virgin were deliberately blocking new entrants from launching rival services at peak times.   Related: Why aren\u2019t the likes of Rex and Bonza flying high in Australian skies? Ask the politicians  | John Quiggin    McKenzie also hit back against suggestions from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, that Rex\u2019s issues stemmed from its expansion into offering jet services on the lucrative \u201cgolden triangle\u201d between Sydney-Melbourne-Brisbane and its push to compete with Qantas and Virgin since 2020. \u201cWhen Rex launched into those routes to compete against Qantas, Virgin was grounded, prices were sky high, and service was appalling. They raised private equity of around $150m to enter that market and provided much-needed competition for Qantas,\u201d McKenzie told ABC Radio National. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got the prime minister saying, \u2018Well, Rex, this is what happens when you go up against the behemoth and my best mate Qantas.\u2019\u201d \u201cThere is a problem with competition in this country.\u201d McKenzie said the fact Bonza had also recently collapsed suggested broader issues. \u201cTwo airlines in just four months have been beaten into submission under Anthony Albanese.\u201d Sydney airport\u2019s leadership, a longtime critic of the federal legislation governing access to its slots, expressed its disappointment at Rex entering voluntary administration. \u201cWhat this situation demonstrates is that we need to change some things in the Australian aviation market for competition to thrive, because recent history suggests the barriers are too high,\u201d Sydney airport\u2019s CEO, Scott Charlton, said on Wednesday. A government-ordered review into Sydney airport\u2019s slot access delivered recommendations for competition reforms that Labor has indicated it will address in its upcoming aviation white paper, due imminently. Meanwhile, the premiers of Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland spoke about the need for government intervention to ensure Rex\u2019s regional services continue in operating as a link between rural communities and cities, including for health services.", "\u2018When they stick their heads out they get a bullet\u2019: the trials of managing Australia\u2019s feral pigs [2023-12-09T19:00:27Z]": "The video is taken down the barrel of a rifle. In the frame is a dog wearing chest and neck protection, harrying a wild boar. The tall dry grass, among straggly bush and scattered termite mounds typical of far north Queensland, obscures the action. The dog barks and circles then leaps from lethal tusks as the cornered beast charges. \u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d says a voice. The dog stands off. A single shot sounds and the boar falls. The voice belongs to a woman named Natasha, who asked that her surname not be used. Natasha and her husband, Daniel, supplement their income through Boaring Australia, a YouTube channel that documents their pig hunting across the country. Despite the grisly public perception, Natasha says it\u2019s \u201cnot a blood sport\u201d.    \u201cWe promote pig hunting as something you can do recreationally as a family,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the kids (Donnie, 4, and Aleah, 7) it is like exploring every time we go hunting. They are so aware of their surroundings and are always fossicking and looking for bush tucker. They probably know more about the bush than most men.\u201d There is no shortage of their chosen game. Feral pigs cover 45% of the Australian landmass, and the Invasive Species Council estimates their numbers fall between two and four million, depending on the season. They cause $106.5m worth of damage to the agricultural sector each year \u2013 not including environmental damage, which leads to biodiversity loss \u2013 and they play a role in spreading deadly diseases such as melioidosis.    Feral pigs have a devastating impact on the landscape, threatening the habitat of 149 threatened species by digging up soil and vegetation, fouling waterways and preying on smaller animals such as reptiles, frogs and eggs, including turtle eggs. They are also, the council says, \u201cvectors for diseases\u201d including leptospirosis, brucellosis and foot-and-mouth disease. If a foot-and-mouth outbreak were to hit Australia, spread by feral pigs, the economic losses are predicted to be as much as $50bn. And unlike some other invasive species, there is no publicity campaign against shooting them. All this means is that the recreational hunting of feral pigs is common. But the Invasive Species Council says that funding such hunters \u201cas a primary method of control is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d. The National Feral Pig Action Plan, endorsed in October 2021, suggests using a range of methods to control pig numbers, including shooting, baiting, trapping and fencing. At least 70% of the feral pig population must be culled every year \u201cjust to keep a lid on population growth\u201d, says Dr Heather Channon, the management coordinator at the National Feral Pig Action Plan.    \u201cOur aim is to get populations of feral pigs down as low as possible, and to keep them there over the long term, because we know that if we don\u2019t \u2013 if we start and then stop \u2013 they will recover very quickly,\u201d Channon says.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Channon believes the most effective way to control large numbers of pigs is with aerial shooting, followed by baiting and trapping, but she sees a role for the recreational hunter. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only got a small number of pigs in an area then ground shooting becomes a very feasible and practical method.\u201d  \u2018We practice ethical hunting\u2019 In northern New South Wales, farmers Scott Stewart and Stewart Walker are harvesting on Coolootai Station, north of Warialda. Stewart is on the header and begins on the paddock perimeters, leaving isolated stands of tall, yellowed wheat that quiver with unseen menace. \u201cPigs get into the crop, they live in the crop and make nests,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get on top of them they can wipe out acres, just flatten them.\u201d   Related: From wild herbs to feral pigs: should Australia manage invasive species by eating them?    As the refuge of unharvested wheat becomes smaller with each passing run of the header, the trembling intensifies until a mob of 30 feral pigs breaks from cover. Waiting is Walker, standing on the roof of a truck with rifle in hand. \u201cWhen they stick their heads out they get a bullet,\u201d Stewart says. Stewart and Walker employ all tools in the feral pig management toolbox. When crops are small they bait and trap pigs but as the crops come into grain, meaning well-fed pigs, they resort to aerial shooting, which can cost them $4,000 per half-day with helicopter hire, fuel and ammunition. They do this twice a year. \u201cWe did a chopper shoot here six weeks ago and shot 431 pigs in five hours over 8,000 acres,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cBut we also have blokes that come out with dogs who might get a dozen pigs a night. These days they have thermal scopes and can see pigs across the other side of the paddock and with no light the pigs don\u2019t seem to worry as much. Recreational hunters can be effective.\u201d Pig hunting is sometimes portrayed as one of the last bastions of the rural redneck, but the Game Hunters Association of Australia (GHAA), which has been in operation for 25 years and has more than 500 members, promotes a different image.   Related: When the farm burns or the grass runs out, it\u2019s a battle to keep valuable livestock alive    \u201cWe don\u2019t go out there and blast everything that moves. We practice ethical hunting,\u201d says Leigh Bernhardt, the GHAA president. \u201cWe work with the property owner to target pest species. For example, he may have pigs on a crop and we will go in and clear them. \u201cWe like to hunt [at distances of] between 50 to 150 metres because that involves hunting and stalking, and whenever you pull that trigger you have to know where that bullet is going to go. If an animal is wounded our policy says you must track it down and finish it.\u201d Members of GHAA must hold a current gun licence and undergo mandatory training that covers hunter ethics, safety, policy, insurance and first aid. \u201cThe property owner is assured they [the shooters] are people we have vetted, trained and are competent and capable,\u201d Bernhardt says.    The GHAA does not disallow the use of dogs in pig hunting but it also does not endorse it. It says it prefers cutting-edge technologies such as thermal scopes that allow hunters to \u201csee\u201d animals that the human eye misses, giving an edge to the predator over their prey. Yet for all the training and technology, Bernhardt acknowledges the role of recreational hunters in controlling feral pigs is \u201ca contentious issue\u201d, but adds, \u201cif you ask the farmers they couldn\u2019t do without us\u201d. \u201cPigs spread brucellosis, they destroy crops and pasture, they spread disease, they ruin native habitat, they degrade soil and water, they eat the native species,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last thing the farmer wants is a bunch of pigs coming through doing all that.\u201d  Mandy McKeesick is a writer from central Queensland ", "Queensland introduces Australian-first law to allow midwives and nurses to prescribe abortion pills  [2023-11-30T03:02:56Z]": "Queensland will become Australia\u2019s first jurisdiction to introduce a law to allow nurses and midwives to dispense pregnancy termination medication in a move expected to improve access in the state\u2019s \u201chuge abortion deserts\u201d. In August the Therapeutic Goods Administration scrapped restrictions on the prescription of medical abortion pills, known as MS-2 Step, to be used in the early stages of pregnancy. But it is up to individual jurisdictions to determine the specific healthcare practitioner and the appropriate qualifications for prescribing. In Queensland \u2013 where abortion access has been described as \u201ca postcode lottery\u201d \u2013 legislation must be introduced to allow the changes to take place.

Katrice Bulgarelli, the senior counsellor at Children By Choice, said she had spoken to one Queensland woman who had to drive two-and-a-half-hours each way to see a prescribing doctor. \u201cIf you have to see the doctor \u2026 for appropriate follow-up care that\u2019s a two-and-a-half-hour drive six times,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely unnecessary step for women, in my opinion. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t be accessible for someone [who has experienced domestic violence] who might be trying to access care discreetly and safely.\u201d Bulgarelli said transport costs could make termination services unaffordable, while telehealth services were not always appropriate for those who lacked trust in the medical system. \u201cIt will be such a welcome change for nurses and midwives to be able to support women and pregnant persons with this choice,\u201d she said.  \u201cThe Queensland government\u2019s not only made the commitment to the legislation but to also operationalising it and making sure that in practice, it does actually open up more health practitioners to be able to provide this care. \u201cSo \u2026 Queensland will be the first state in Australia that will actually allow nurses and midwives to prescribe MS-2 Step.\u201d MSI Australia\u2019s director of clinical excellence, Catriona Melville, said she was \u201cdelighted\u201d to see the laws introduced. \u201cWe support this progressive move, and we believe it will contribute to better health outcomes for Queenslanders and set a positive example for the rest of the country,\u201d she said. The state\u2019s health minister, Shannon Fentiman, said the law would bolster equitable access to terminations across the state. \u201cAccess to safe termination of pregnancy care is a basic human right that remains a significant health issue for Queenslanders,\u201d she said. \u201cNurses and midwives have the necessary skills, experience, qualifications and training to be able to undertake this important role and provide greater access to reproductive healthcare, particularly in rural and remote communities.\u201d Under the proposed changes, doctors will remain the only health practitioners allowed to perform surgical abortions, as well as medical terminations for gestations nine weeks and above. The amendments will also change references from \u201cwoman\u201d to \u201cperson\u201d to ensure all pregnant people can access medical terminations \u2013 including those who are transgender or gender-diverse. The new laws come as the government announced on Thursday it would also introduce midwife-to-patient ratios in Queensland\u2019s public hospitals.

That fact makes more recent polling very grim reading for Labor supporters. RedBridge group\u2019s polling from August and September shows Labor trailing 53-47 among women across the state.

Some commentary bemoaned the beginning of a year-long campaign. Mercifully for the Queensland public, the promotional video is actually clear evidence that Labor is not ready to campaign. Its vulnerabilities are writ large in the way Palaszczuk speaks mostly to the sorts of concerns of traditional Labor voters: health and hospitals, education, housing and social reforms. There seems to be a particular focus on measures targeted at women. The video also contained another clear message: Palaszczuk would be leading Labor to the next election. Labor MPs would have moved on Palaszczuk a few months ago, but party rules requiring a drawn-out leadership contest have fortified her position. In August, a scenario was being discussed that suggested Palaszczuk might be convinced to resign before the end of the year. It involved party elders approaching her and suggesting it was in the party\u2019s interests for her to stand down. She could leave a Labor hero. But a bad election loss \u2013 or a hospital pass to a new leader in an election year \u2013 would threaten her legacy. Labor MPs suggested Palaszczuk could be offered a few months to let leadership speculation die down and resign on her own terms. Daniel Andrews has, in the meantime, gone out on top. Palaszczuk fights on. Political attack lines    While the past week might not have signalled the start of a year-long election campaign, it has given us an insight into what the next year will look like. The LNP holds only four seats in Brisbane and has previously run conflicted, ineffective campaigns against Palaszczuk. In the process it has lost regional voters to rightwing fringe parties and lost any semblance of a foothold in the city. Conventional wisdom has said the LNP would need to win relatively progressive inner-city seats and socially conservative regional ones to win a majority. But withdrawing support from Queensland\u2019s treaty process seems to show the LNP all-in on the outer suburbs and the regions, even if it might mean potentially losing blue-ribbon city seats such as Clayfield to Labor or the Greens.   Related: Queensland LNP abandons support for treaty with First Nations people    Expect the LNP to look more like a party led by Tony Abbott \u2013 ruthlessly exploiting every possible political advantage, determined to win by any means possible after losing 11 of the past 12 state elections \u2013 than one too worried about collateral damage from its attacks. Labor is yearning for the comfort of its winning strategies from elections gone by. And it has begun by laying traps for Crisafulli. One is pressure over whether the LNP would keep Labor\u2019s increased royalties when coal companies are making super profits. By refusing to rule out royalty changes next term, Crisafulli walks into an ambush. The attacks lines are already written: what is he going to cut from the budget to compensate? Will he do a Campbell Newman and sell off assets? Another political landmine was prepared this week when Labor moved to enshrine its energy plans in law. Legislating renewable energy targets is the bait. The kicker is the laws would also mandate public ownership of the energy sector. Any wavering by the LNP and the ghost of Campbell Newman returns to haunt another campaign. All of this might help Labor. Or it might do the opposite. If voters think Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s eight-year-old government is tired, wheeling out the same old attack lines might just help that notion take root.", "Australia\u2019s most advantaged and disadvantaged areas: how does your suburb compare?  [2023-04-27T20:53:23Z]": "Australia\u2019s most advantaged suburbs tend to be on or next to water and are clustered around Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs and north shore, while regional areas dominate the list of the nation\u2019s most disadvantaged areas, new government data reveals. Updated socioeconomic indexes based on 2021 census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday reveal that Woollahra in Sydney\u2019s inner-east is the nation\u2019s most advantaged local government area (LGA), and six of the top 10 most advantaged LGAs suburbs are in close proximity of Sydney\u2019s CBD.

Interactive   The socioeconomic index takes into account census data on income, education, occupation, housing, employment and family structure, among other factors, to rank an area\u2019s advantage and disadvantage. The factors are combined to create a score with an average of about 1,000. Lower scores indicate areas of relative disadvantage. You can search the rankings and scores for all LGAs in the table below:   Interactive   In a broad trend, the ABS noted that \u201cdisadvantaged areas tend to be in regional and remote communities, while advantaged areas tend to be in major cities\u201d. This in part reflects that city-based jobs, including those of office workers, commonly require a university degree, while agriculture and resource jobs are traditionally located in regional areas. However the ABS data revealed how discrepancies can emerge between neighbouring LGAs. \u201cNoosa and Gympie in Queensland are an interesting example of this rank applied in practice,\u201d the ABS said. \u201cNoosa ranked in the highest 20% of LGAs, while neighbouring Gympie ranked in the lowest 15%.

To enrol more students, institutions would be required to establish additional purpose-built student accommodation. \nIn submissions to the bill, published on Wednesday, regional and smaller universities were pointing the finger at elite capital city institutions, including the University of Sydney, alleging they should be targeted due to having a larger impact on the rental crisis. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe Regional Universities Network (Run) said its institutions should explicitly be exempt from the cap, noting just 3.5% of onshore international students attended a regional campus. \n\u201cInternational education is a national interest whose immense benefits ought to be more equitably distributed, rather than continue to become increasingly concentrated to a limited number of providers,\u201d its submission read. \n \n  Related: Australia\u2019s international student cap has been called \u2018chaotic\u2019 and \u2018populist\u2019 \u2013 so how would it work?  \n \nCharles Sturt University (CSU) went further, placing the blame squarely with universities in major urban centres, noting 50% of all international students in 2022 were enrolled at just five elite Group of Eight institutions. \nMore than 30% of the market share was spread across three \u2013 the University of Sydney (16.4%), the University of Melbourne (10.2%) and Monash (10%). \n\u201cThe universities with lower international student enrolments must be given the same opportunities to grow international enrolments as universities that currently have high enrolments,\u201d its submission read. \n\u201cExpecting regional universities to fund the construction of student accommodation to support metropolitan campuses would require the reduction of the already-limited capital funding.\u201d \nSimilarly, the University of South Australia and the University of Adelaide said limiting enrolments for any one institution was only an appropriate response to \u201chighly concentrated student numbers in some capital cities\u201d. \n\u201cOther parts of Australia are actively pursuing population growth to support workforce needs and have the capacity and capability to increase international student numbers.\u201d \nThe IHEA (Independent Higher Education Australia) said the federal government\u2019s key objective should be to \u201ccurtail the significant growth that has occurred in some public universities\u201d. \n\u201cThis has occurred while many providers in the sector, including independent higher education providers, have been subjected to blanket student visa refusals. \n \n  Related: International students should make up no more than a third of university cohort, RMIT vice-chancellor says  \n \n\u201cRather than reduce international student numbers equitably and transparently, the government appears to be protecting only a small number of elite universities, such as the University of Sydney where it has been reported that 32,800 international students are enrolled this semester \u2026 47% of their student body.\u201d \nAccording to the Department of Home Affairs, the number of student visa applications granted in the year to 31 March was 34% lower than the previous year as stricter migration rules came into effect. \nThere were 671,359 student visa holders in March \u2013 the third highest monthly figure.

At first, Holmes and her husband used the car to plug in their fridges and those of their neighbours in the adjoining units but when the power did not come back on quickly, she started to wonder whether the BYD Atto 3 the couple bought in February could also handle the life-saving dialysis machine. \u201cWe ran it off the car,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe only needed to use it for the one night.

It was also the only job he could see himself doing. After high school, Bailey left his family farm at Croppa Creek in north-west New South Wales to work as a jackaroo in big stations in northern Australia. Then the vehicle he was travelling in rolled on the Barkly Highway, and \u201cin a heartbeat my whole life was shot down another road\u201d. Bailey returned home a quadriplegic. It was 1987 and the then 19-year-old did not know what to do.   Related: Doubt and flooding rains: how an unusual El Ni\u00f1o has affected Australian farmers    \u201cFarming is in my blood and I\u2019ve had dirt under the fingernails since day one, but I never imagined I\u2019d arrive home in a wheelchair,\u201d he says. Bailey was advised by medical staff to consider an office job in town. \u201cBut I just couldn\u2019t come at that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, against their advice Mum and Dad picked me up and we went home to the farm at Croppa Creek.\u201d With no connection to others in similar circumstances and no internet to research their predicament, Bailey and his family were forced to work out how to make wheelchair adaptations on their farm by themselves.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Freedom and mobility for Bailey returned first with a four-wheel bike. Then came a hand-controlled car and modified farm machinery. To access tractors and headers the family, with help from a bush mechanic in Warialda, devised a motorised hoist fitted with a plastic kitchen chair and mounted on the back of a HiLux. Bailey, now retired to an 80-acre (32-hectare) property near Tamworth, says technology such as drones, which can be used to check stock and water, and autonomous agriculture make life easier for those in wheelchairs. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s kind of sad if you just want to farm from your phone inside your house,\u201d he says. \u201cHalf the pleasure is going out and seeing the echidna cross the road and the birds flying.\u201d    Changing the industry Glen Clarke became a paraplegic after a truck accident in 2003 and, like Bailey, had been advised not to return to his previous life on the family farm at Kempsey, on the NSW mid-north coast. \u201cWe were advised to sell the farm and get a job in town but we struggled through with family and changed our operation from cows and calves to steers to make it less labour-intensive,\u201d he says. Like Bailey, Clarke found himself isolated in his new life. There was no network for those with a disability in agriculture. Even off-farm, there were accessibility issues. \u201cI had to use the grains storage ramp to get into the produce store,\u201d Clarke says. Clarke was already married with four children aged between five and 13 at the time of the accident. \u201cThe biggest challenge in the early stages was learning acceptance and patience, but I\u2019ve always said you can either lay down or get up and do something about it,\u201d he says. His youngest daughter, Josie, is now undertaking a PhD in agriculture. After one particularly wet season, when Clarke\u2019s wheelchair bogged in the sodden black soil, the pair had a long conversation about support and accessibility issues in agriculture. In 2021 Josie Clarke launched Ability Agriculture, a not-for-profit organisation aimed at providing support for people with disabilities in agriculture.    \u201cI wanted to share stories of people with disabilities in agriculture to challenge traditional views, raise awareness, create opportunity and provide a supportive community,\u201d she says. A 2023 survey commissioned by the organisation found that 81% of respondents were not aware there were rehabilitation programs for agricultural workers who were injured in an accident and 61% did not think there were transparent career pathways for agricultural workers with a disability. It also found that 72% of employers said they would modify or adapt their workplaces to make them more accessible \u2013 and that number rose to 80% if there were grants or subsidies available. The federal government administers the employment assistance fund to aid workplaces make modifications but Clarke says a lack of clear information about the grant criteria leads to 80% of people with disabilities funding adaptations themselves.

Self-funding adaptations \u201ccan lead to people leaving agriculture because of financial restraints\u201d. Ability Agriculture publishes an accessibility checklist for agricultural events and businesses. It also sponsors young people with disabilities to take part in agricultural shows and hosted a seminar with SafeWork NSW in Wagga Wagga in October on adapting in agriculture, which provided an opportunity for people with disabilities to talk about their experiences in the industry. \u201cIt creates a space for businesses to come and ask questions and that\u2019s really important in building disability confidence in the industry,\u201d Clarke says. She says technological improvements and a more inclusive approach from industry could make agriculture a more welcoming place to those with disabilities. \u201cOne thing I learned from Dad being in a wheelchair was that it was OK to be vulnerable and it\u2019s OK to be frustrated when you can\u2019t do certain things,\u201d she says. \u201cTogether we can figure out a different way to do them.\u201d  Mandy McKeesick is a writer from central Queensland Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Monet, Kusama and very good dog art: regional Australia\u2019s big summer exhibitions [2023-12-09T19:00:29Z]": "Big summer art shows are no longer confined to big cities.

An official assessment from fire authorities and the Bureau of Meteorology, co-ordinated by the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities (AFAC) and released on Wednesday morning, points to a likely early start to the fire season in Victoria. The BoM forecasts an increased chance of higher than average temperatures across many parts of the country from August to October, which raises the risk of bushfires.   Related:  It\u2019s time to give up on \u2018normal\u2019 weather: Australia\u2019s climate is entering a different phase | David Bowman for the Conversation     Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email  Fire authorities warned people to prepare for the coming fire season and have survival plans in place. Rob Webb, the chief executive of AFAC, said the areas showing an increased risk of fire were liable to either see more fire activity or fires that were harder to extinguish because of the high amount of fuel such as dried grass, leaves, twigs and dead branches. He said: \u201cThat increased risk comes from there being more fuel available that can hold a fire that, if it starts under the right conditions, are harder to control.\u201d   Interactive The parts of Australia facing a raised bushfire risk this spring   The report said the potential for fires through spring in New South Wales was normal, but the grass fuel loads were high in many areas which, if it dried out, could pose a risk. Total fire bans were in place in Illawarra and greater Sydney on Monday, and a grassfire near Newcastle this week burnt through more than 200 hectares of bushland before coming under control.    In Queensland, central and southern parts had experienced a \u201csignificant curing event\u201d in late winter where frosts and winds had dried out grasslands and open forested areas, the bushfire outlook report said. Expected higher than average temperatures across the state, combined with high fuel loads, were increasing the fire risk. This winter drying could see grassland fires spread into exposed forested areas. The Rural Fire Service Queensland chief officer, Ben Millington, said a relatively wet summer followed by a warm and dry winter had seen grass growth accelerate, and unseasonably warm temperatures of recent weeks had already seen fires in parts of the state. Some 420 hazard reduction burns had been carried out in the last couple of months to reduce fuel loads, he said. He said whether people were inside or outside \u201cthose red areas on our map\u201d they should be preparing for fires by clearing gutters and yards, removing overhanging branches and and making sure the household had a bushfire survival plan. \u201cThat is: plan where to go, what to do and what to take. People need to heed these warnings and prepare now,\u201d he said. In south-west Victoria and south-east South Australia, a very dry autumn and winter had seen an increase in dead and dry plant material. Warmer temperatures expected in spring would see this drying continue, increasing the fire risk. In the NT, a combination of high vegetation growth and then dry conditions, with forecasts of above-average temperatures, was pushing fire risk up for spring. Fire risk was considered at normal levels for Western Australia. No complacency Even in areas where fire activity was expected to be normal, \u201cdestructive and deadly fires can still occur during normal bushfire seasons\u201d, the outlook said. The federal emergency management minister, Senator Jenny McAllister, said \u201cit\u2019s important that all communities prepare for the fire season\u201d, even though increased risk has been flagged for the NT, Queensland and Victoria. \u201cThe outlook predicts an increased likelihood of unusually high maximum temperatures across Australia this Spring. I encourage Australians to be aware of the current fire risk in their own areas and make sure their bushfire plans are up to date.\u201d Webb said \u201cthe message is not one of complacency\u201d. People living in fire-prone areas should be making plans now and using times without fire to prepare, he said. The BoM said in the outlook report that since the 1950s, there had been an increase in extreme fire weather and the fire season had lengthened across large parts of the country. \u201cSeasons are starting earlier and the intensity [of fires] are in the stronger end,\u201d Webb added.", "Morning Mail: Coalition reignites climate wars, security council endorses Gaza ceasefire plan, Titmus sends Paris warning [2024-06-10T20:59:07Z]": "Morning, everyone.

It follows two of the state\u2019s top scientific bodies publishing test results from water samples taken near Menindee in far western New South Wales which contained inconsistent results. Testing conducted on behalf of the NSW chief scientist, on samples collected in August 2023 as part of an independent review into the deadly fish kill event in March in which 30m fish died, found low levels of some pesticides. Separate testing led by the NSW Environment Protection Authority did not detect any pesticides, despite collecting samples at similar locations and during the same month as the chief scientist\u2019s testing.   Related: Menindee mass fish deaths symptomatic of degradation of river ecosystem, NSW chief scientist says    The testing for the chief scientist was conducted by Charles Sturt University. It detected several herbicides including atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, tebuthiuron, metolachlor, clopyralid and fluroxypyr. Atrazine, simazine, tebuthiuron and metolachlor are no longer approved for use in the European Union and have been classified by the European Chemicals Agency as being \u201cvery toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects\u201d, but they are still approved for use in Australia. The NSW deputy chief scientist and engineer, Dr Darren Saunders, said the CSU testing was commissioned due to requests from the community and the independent review\u2019s need for further data.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The CSU report said the herbicide levels were \u201cconsistent with agricultural land-use in the area\u201d and recommended ongoing monitoring. Two pesticides, tebuthiuron and metolachlor, were found to have exceeded the 99% species protection level in Australian and New Zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality, which signifies a concentration estimated to be toxic to 1% of organisms in that aquatic environment. Both were below the 95% value, which the EPA tests for. In contrast, the NSW EPA said it had not detected any pesticides of a reportable level in any routine testing of the river which had been conducted since the fish kill in March. This included its results from August, when the CSU samples were also collected. \u2018A cocktail of pesticides\u2019 Dr Matt Landos, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Queensland and director of Future Fisheries Veterinary Service, said the results showed \u201cseriously concerning\u201d levels of herbicides, which could produce \u201can elevated risk of ecological harm occurring\u201d. Landos said the guidelines did not consider the cumulative impact of \u201ca cocktail of multiple pesticides\u201d on the aquatic ecosystem. He said that while the mass fish deaths at Menindee were attributed to low oxygen levels, the potential contribution of pesticides should also be investigated, alongside other issues like excessive nutrients from agricultural run-off. \u201cPesticides were likely one of several contributors harming the ecosystem, particularly upstream, making the water that flowed to Menindee vulnerable to produce near-zero oxygen conditions,\u201d he said. Landos said pesticides, even at low levels, could modify the aquatic food web by \u201cselectively harming sensitive organisms\u201d such as algae and allowing more tolerant species to predominate. \u201cThis is what\u2019s happening in the Murray-Darling,\u201d Landos said. \u201cAnd the most tolerant organisms, as it turns out, are cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae.\u201d He said blue-green algae blooms could impair the ecological function of the river by creating volatile dissolved oxygen conditions, where oxygen levels rapidly rise during the day \u201cdue to extreme photosynthetic activity\u201d and then plummet overnight. \u201cThe bigger the biomass of algae, the more oxygen they\u2019re going to require in that water body to keep everything alive,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the bloom is too dense, it will suck the oxygen level down far too low and it can in fact cause mortality even to the algae.\u201d Landos said it was concerning that the EPA testing and CSU testing had produced such different results, and called for a review into the \u201csensitivity\u201d of the testing methods. The EPA told Guardian Australia its results were valid and its testing did not show any concentrations which exceeded the reporting limits. It said those limits were \u201cwell below the 95% guideline values\u201d and consistent with best practice under the laboratory standard used by the Department of Climate Change, Environment, Energy and Water. In April, the EPA announced its testing had \u201cruled out a pesticide pollution event\u201d after the results came back negative for more than 600 pesticides. It has since reduced the frequency of pesticide sampling \u201cfollowing consistent zero results\u201d from multiple testing rounds, including its results from August.   Related: Fears of \u2018weed highways\u2019 as summer rains spread invasive plants through rural Australia    A spokesperson for NSW EPA said the organisation\u2019s testing methods \u201care sensitive enough to detect concentrations of ecological significance\u201d. They added that results below that limit \u201chave a high uncertainty, are not meaningful and reporting them is not appropriate nor consistent with analytical best practice\u201d. They also suggested the CSU results were inconsistent, as the published report was amended in December. \u201cThe reporting limit is the lowest concentration that can be reliably measured,\u201d the EPA said. They also said that exceeding the 99% or 95% default guideline values \u201cdoes not indicate an actual impact, rather that further investigations are warranted\u201d. Vincent Pettigrove, a professor of aquatic pollution at RMIT, said while the guideline values provided an indication of whether the chemicals of interest were at concentrations which may cause environmental harm, there were no national guidelines for \u201cthe majority of pesticides registered for use in Australia\u201d. He added that the ecotoxicological tests used to derive the guideline values for pesticides \u201care often short-term acute tests and do not account well for chronic long-term exposures\u201d. \u201cI believe that the impact of pesticides on fish is more likely to be more subtle from chronic exposure that may reduce the viability of populations.\u201d Pettigrove said the guideline values were for one chemical and therefore \u201cunable to consider the total effects of a mixture of chemicals\u201d. For example, the triazine herbicides detected in the CSU study had a similar mode of toxicity, \u201cso their combined effect should be considered\u201d, he said.

While there, she decided the most rewarding path would be to pursue rural and remote medicine. \u201cI completed a rotation in tropical medicine organised by the School of Medicine and Dentistry in partnership with Rural Medical Education Australia [RMEA],\u201d she says.     Mikaela Seymour  Then, in 2020, she was embedded with the newly established Sustainable Development Program aerial health patrols based in Balimo, in Western Province, Papua New Guinea. \u201cThis is an area that had been wholly neglected, without a doctor for 20 years,\u201d Seymour says. She recalls focusing on preventative healthcare rather than reactive \u2013 prioritising what would have the biggest impact on the community in the long term \u2013 despite the challenges presented by the remoteness of some of the region.    This is an area that had been wholly neglected, without a doctor for 20 years.  Mikaela Seymour     \u201cThere was no phone connection, no electricity, no running water \u2013 we had to collect our water from the river and boil it. That made infection prevention and control [difficult]. So [we were] using a lot of innovation to try and get the best outcomes for patients, with very limited resources.\u201d Making an impact through medicine Since that first visit Seymour has returned to work in Papua New Guinea every year. \u201cI have served on hospital ships sailing to some of the remotest islands of Milne Bay, and volunteered back at Kiunga Hospital to support Griffith\u2019s rural medical and midwifery students program,\u201d she says. \u201cMore recently, I joined Australian Doctors International as the doctor on the ground for a new program serving Middle Fly, an area of PNG that has been neglected for too long. I had the absolute privilege to fly on small Caravan eight-seater planes, landing on grass air strips, and be hosted by communities.\u201d Seymour says Griffith\u2019s rural program, in partnership with RMEA, made her adaptable. \u201cI am now completing my advanced training in public health medicine and spent a year studying at the PNG Institute of Medical Research in Goroka,\u201d she says. \u201cDuring my time there I was able to work with the WHO office in the quantification of the effect of Covid-19 on health systems, work for the chief public health officer of Eastern Highlands, and be supervised by Dr [Pamela] Toliman, one of the lead scientists in the validation of Covid-19 rapid diagnostic tests in the Pacific.\u201d \u201c[Griffith\u2019s] emphasis on multidisciplinary and cross-cultural training made it easy for me to assimilate into these diverse teams.\u201d Tech innovations for good Raymond Siems studied a Bachelor of Engineering at Griffith and has founded multiple innovative tech businesses that have had a positive impact. \u201cWhen we start a new company we look for something that is good for people or society and also good business,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is influenced by the systems thinking I was taught at uni \u2013 an approach to problem solving that takes into account the overall system and connections between elements, rather than each part in isolation.\u201d    While at university, Siems met the co-founders of his first enterprise, Ventoura, a team with which he still works with nearly 10 years on. \u201cWe were passionate about travel and wanted to create a platform for peer-to-peer experiences so that travellers could get off the beaten track and see the locals\u2019 side of their destination,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were lucky enough to start working with investors from Helsinki.

In the UK he has founded startups including Catalyst AI, which uses data science and machine learning to help fashion companies reduce waste by optimising supply chains, and created a crowdfunding platform to support National Health Service workers. \u201cDuring the pandemic our team helped to build a fundraising and distribution platform that was able to transform gifts in kind and donations from the public into support for about 100,000 healthcare workers,\u201d he says. His latest business, Ravio, aims to bring data-driven decision-making to team management, to enable companies to pay people fairly and build more diverse teams. \u201cWhat you get paid at work is opaque and filled with bias. And yet it [has] such a big influence on our lives. It determines the lives we can lead and many of the opportunities we have. \u201cWe help companies improve their compensation practices, analysing their gender pay gap, and evaluating whether they are paying their employees fairly and competitively with the market with our benchmarking platform.\u201d Siems says starting out at Griffith gave him the drive to keep innovating and founding new projects. \u201cThe technical skills I learned through my degree gave me foundational skills I was able to rapidly build on once I started my career,\u201d he says. \u201cLearning the theory and quickly turning it into practice.

This week\u2019s Sydney council book ban shows how far we have to go | Shannon Molloy [2024-05-09T02:54:18Z]": "Fourteen, the stage adaptation of my memoir of the same name, captures a moment in history and in my life that feels so far away now. It\u2019s been 25 years since 1999, when a lonely and terrified teenage boy found himself suffocating in a repressive regional Queensland town and trapped in an all-boys, NRL-mad Catholic school, where he was a \u201cfaggot\u201d, \u201cpoofter\u201d, \u201cpillow-biter\u201d and \u201cfudge-packer\u201d, but never called by his name. There was a daily backdrop of extreme violence and relentless taunting \u2013 in the playground, on the street, in the shopping centre. Just two years earlier, Tasmania had become the final state in Australia to decriminalise homosexuality; all many of us knew about it was gleaned from news about the Aids crisis, true crime documentaries about the murders of dozens of gay men in Sydney, and lazy comedy caricatures about promiscuous flight attendants and hairdressers.   Related: Western Sydney councillor doubles down on same-sex parent book ban as residents express outrage over move    That boy spent most waking moments loathing the inevitable fact that he was going to wind up gay \u2013 just about the worst thing you could be in that place and that time \u2013 and wondering how he would ever be happy, safe or loved. I made it out alive thanks to caring friends, protective siblings, a ferocious mother and an extensive catalogue of cheesy, upbeat pop songs. Not everybody was so lucky. After one of our recent Sydney shows, a woman in her 50s approached me in the foyer, her eyes red and cheeks damp. \u201cThank God things aren\u2019t like that any more,\u201d she sighed, gripping me tightly. But really, how much has changed since I was a kid? This week, a council in western Sydney voted to strip its local libraries of books about or referring to same-sex parent families. The motivation was to \u201cprotect\u201d innocent children from \u201csexualisation\u201d. That part of the city is devoutly religious and family-friendly, the council declared; the implication was that anyone queer must be perverted, sinful, committed to the destruction of the family unit, and somehow preying on children. Feels a lot like the bad old days to me. If that\u2019s what we\u2019re contending with in 2024, in one of the world\u2019s most queer-friendly cities, what\u2019s life like beyond the big smoke?  Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  Fourteen is visiting 20 stops across Australia over the next five months, the majority of them in the regions. That was so important to me because it\u2019s where my story began and where, in some of those towns, being gay is still fraught with danger. The show will travel to Bathurst, about 200km west of Sydney, and Orange, in the state\u2019s central west. Plans for Pride events in both towns recently attracted vile threats that almost derailed festivities. A young man from Dubbo, a few hours\u2019 drive north of Orange, wrote to me to apologise for being unable to come to our production there. He\u2019s too scared to be seen going to a \u201cgay show\u201d. We programmed some matinee sessions for this tour, hoping high school teachers could take their class in during school hours \u2013 but we\u2019re hearing there\u2019s a strong fear of backlash from parents if they even suggest it. We\u2019ll be in Wyong on the NSW Central Coast soon, where a vetted and endorsed political candidate for the Liberal party was eventually dumped after a series of historical comments on social media \u2013 comparing homosexuality to incest and necrophilia, and labelling it a \u201cperversion\u201d under a post about conversion practices \u2013 came to light. I\u2019m anxious about our visit to Maryborough in Queensland, where a brutal killing in 2008 sparked a campaign to end the so-called \u201cgay panic\u201d defence, which essentially meant a \u201chomosexual advance\u201d could justify murder. It took nine years for the state parliament to scrap the barbaric provision. We\u2019re also off to Rockhampton in central Queensland, about 45 minutes from my childhood home town, where some bookshops initially refused to stock Fourteen due to its content. Of course, as we\u2019ve learned this week, these attitudes aren\u2019t confined to regional and rural Australia. Take Canberra, for instance, where the show travels this week \u2013 and where some of our elected officials are now lobbying for a so-called religious freedom bill. If legislated, it could allow schools to sack queer teachers, nursing homes to boot out queer residents, and devout pharmacists to refuse medications to queer customers, on the basis of religious belief.

Isn\u2019t everything hard enough already? | First Dog on the Moon    We return to Brisbane in June, where we first staged Fourteen, and where a dear friend\u2019s son faced relentless bullying for his identity at his school in an affluent middle ring suburb, and received little support. He took his own life in January. He was 14. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the big leaps forward we\u2019ve made as a society, as a country, over many painful decades. That progress was hard-fought, and those who benefited \u2013 like myself \u2013 did so at the expense and thanks to the sacrifices of countless advocates. I\u2019m married, I have a daughter, and I\u2019ve built a wonderful career in an industry where being gay is such a non-issue that I sometimes forget I am. But if I hadn\u2019t escaped that town \u2013 heck, if I lived 40 minutes further west \u2013 who knows where I would be? For all the Passion Pop and S Club 7 choreography you\u2019ll see in Fourteen, not all of the story is ancient history.

As regulators prepare for new uncrewed traffic, technology companies are exploring ways around connection black spots, to prevent drones dropping out of the sky. And, while the thought of skies filled with drones whizzing past may seem a world away, momentum is building rapidly. Already, the number of drones licensed to operate in Australia is greater than the number of existing airspace users combined, according to government figures. When you run out of milk Amazon already offers drone deliveries in a handful of towns in the US, and was announced as part of a trial in the UK this month, but Australians in certain trial areas have been able to order food and parcels by drone for more than four years. Wing Aviation, a startup owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is among just two operators to gain approval from Australia\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Association (Casa) to conduct beyond visual line of sight piloting \u2013 where the pilot controls aircraft from a computer screen. While the trial approval is thorough in Australia, and requires additional permission from local councils, Wing\u2019s Jesse Suskin describes Casa as among the national regulators more open to exploring early drone use. There are now about 1.5m drone flights a year in Australia, according to Airservices Australia, the federal agency responsible for managing airspace across the country. And operations continue to expand. Last month Wing launched drone delivery in the Maroondah council area in Melbourne\u2019s east, the first trial in Victoria but Wing\u2019s third in Australia. The company operates in parts of south-east Queensland, where more than 60 drones are stationed, after its first attempt in the Australian Capital Territory in 2019. Wing bases its fleets of drones on the rooftop of shopping centres in each of its trial areas.   Related: Australian kestrels may hold the key to helping drones hover    Customers can order via the DoorDash app from stores inside. Workers from shops or restaurants then take orders to the roof, where a Wing employee loads specially designed foldable parcels into the styrofoam drones before they are flown to an address\u2019s driveway or back yard. All that\u2019s required is a space 2m in circumference at the destination to lower the package. \u201cThe slowest part is generally the preparation [and loading],\u201d Suskin says. \u201cOnce it\u2019s on the drone it\u2019s usually there in minutes. We don\u2019t stop for red lights.\u201d Medications and freshly prepared food such as coffee, smoothies and burgers are popular on the service, which can still only support a 1.2kg payload \u2013 better suited to individual and smaller items than a weekly grocery shop. \u201cUp to 10km and back in urban and suburban areas is what we focus on,\u201d Suskin says. \u201cWhen you run out of milk, when you need children\u2019s Panadol: it\u2019s the convenience of being able to send those things by drone instead of having to drive back to the shops through peak hour.\u201d Not like a video game Whereas traditional aviation operations require at least one pilot in each aircraft and air traffic controllers to manage airspace, operators such as Wing are able to mostly automate deliveries. One pilot can be responsible for flying up to 50 drones at a time, which Suskin says can make drone delivery cheaper than relying on cars.    \u201cWhere a business would previously need 50 cars and 50 drivers to deliver 50 cheeseburger orders, to deliver them by drone requires just one pilot,\u201d he says. The industry also provides a new employment horizon for traditional aircraft pilots \u2013 which, given the flexibility beyond visual line of sight piloting offers, could complicate the already tight global market for pilots. While pilots at Wing must work from a remote operations room and don\u2019t have work-from-home freedoms, they are able to avoid the gruelling schedules and intercity travel related to commercial aviation. Talikka has now been a drone pilot with Wing for two years, and flies up to 50 at once. Because the drones are highly automated, he says, the experience is less about controlling individual drones and more about maintaining oversight of an entire delivery map. \u201cI don\u2019t have any vision from the drone while it\u2019s flying, so it\u2019s not so much like a video game \u2013 my focus, it\u2019s really on the big picture in our operating area,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat does the weather look like now, an hour from now? Is there helicopter traffic nearby that I need to account for? Do I need to communicate with the ground staff where the drones are taking off and landing to work on a maintenance issue?\u201d \u2018You never want to lose contact with a drone\u2019 Amid a handful of trials limited to certain geographic catchments with pilots operating dozens of drones beyond their line of sight, regulators are working to prepare Australia\u2019s skies for a surge in uncrewed aircraft and flying taxis. Part of the task is ensuring the expected 60m annual drone flights in Australia by 2043 coexist peacefully with existing air traffic management of commercial planes in urban areas, with Airservices Australia \u2013 the commonwealth body that oversees towers at airports as well as 11% of the world\u2019s airspace \u2013 now developing a system for uncrewed aircraft. Meanwhile, Casa conducts safety checks for drones in the same way it does for airlines, to make sure they don\u2019t drop out of the sky. \u201c[Wing\u2019s] approval followed a rigorous safety assessment by Casa, which confirmed that Wing\u2019s operations meet all required aviation safety standards,\u201d a spokesperson for the regulator said.    It\u2019s less about replacing the shopping trolley, and more the delivery rider on a scooter  Yoav Amitai, Elsight      Wing\u2019s main obstacle is extreme wind and rain, but its drones feature redundancies such as two batteries despite only needing one, and a navigation system which keeps drones hovering even when they lose connection. Swoop Aero, the other operator with Casa approval, uses drones to deliver pharmaceutical products in regional areas. Internet reception limited to urban areas has to date been a key barrier to drones delivering to disconnected rural communities where the method stands to bring the most benefit. But companies are exploring technologies that mean regional operators and off-grid areas are less vulnerable to Australia\u2019s patchy outback mobile reception. Elsight\u2019s Halo communication system effectively allows an operator to organise connection from a range of internet carriers, including from Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellites, to avoid dropouts when piloting long distances. \u201cInstead of relying on a single network, we can rely on them all \u2013 Telstra, Optus, satellite communications,\u201d says Elsight\u2019s chief executive, Yoav Amitai. The technology is geared at operators in rural locations, as well as those who rely on constant high-speed internet, such as drones feeding video for monitoring of sharks, natural disasters or policing. In Australia, where vast telecommunications black spots have been identified as critical weak links in infrastructure chains and bushfire and flood responses, Elsight\u2019s Halo is in use by Sphere Drones, which runs agricultural operations including crop management, as well as in mining.

They\u2019re noisy and dangerous, we already have horses, why do we need cars?\u2019 \u201cBut for delivery, drones are a no-brainer, they will be faster, create less traffic.  \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t be afraid you\u2019ll see drones flying with full grocery carts in the sky.

Ours is a small town on Wiradjuri country, where 20% of local public primary school kids identified as having Aboriginal heritage, according to a 2022 report. In the 2021 census, 8.7% of the town identified as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Nationally the Indigenous population is about 3%. Riverina voted 75% no. I arrived in this place just after the Mabo debate. It was 1996 and Pauline Hanson was coming to parliament \u2013 the first time around. I heard the myths back then about Indigenous people getting more than the rest of us, and I still hear them. I heard all the residual fears about land grabs: first post-Mabo, again during the Wik debate, and again in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s referendum. It was the same old stuff, piled higher with extra grievances such as the need for a Welcome to Country \u201cin your own country\u201d. This time, there was a new catch-22. I heard that Aboriginal people had not pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and yet, somehow, they were simultaneously too successful. Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price\u2019s inaccurate description of the minister for Indigenous Australians, Wiradjuri woman Linda Burney, as \u201cdripping with Gucci\u201d was heard more than once.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  I learned long ago that there is no point yelling at people who disagree with you, particularly when you might see them in the frozen food aisle. Unlike cities, social hierarchies and partisan voters do not have postcodes in the country. That can be a plus, but it can also mean you just don\u2019t talk about politics. This democratic exercise felt like another Great Silence, separate but related to the one described by WEH Stanner in his 1968 Boyer lectures on the cult of forgetfulness regarding the frontier wars. For all the shouting at the federal level, the silence in my town streets was deafening in this campaign. People were loath to talk about the referendum and its implications, much less discuss how they would vote, unless they were confident they were in company who may reflect their own opinions. And while avoiding the discussion kept people on safer social territory, it ensured that no one was exposed to views they might not agree with. In spite of this strange silence, in the final week, someone sidled up to me in a shop. They couldn\u2019t understand why there was such opposition to what seemed like a reasonable proposition. They stopped talking as other people walked past. There was a reticence to be known on either side of the campaign. On the same day, another person asked me to explain the voice proposal in \u201cnormal language\u201d. They were confused by the competing messages but leaning towards a yes vote.  When I attended the local Mechanics\u2019 Institute hall to vote on Saturday, there was one volunteer out front holding a yes sign. He was gone by the time I walked out. There was no one representing the no case, probably because anyone who knew the place knew it was not necessary. I was offered a pen, in case I didn\u2019t trust the process. I declined and voted in pencil. By 7.30 on Saturday night, the voice was defeated. As I threw loaf after loaf at the kitchen bench, I recalled a speech by the Labor senator and Yawuru man Pat Dodson, the so-called father of reconciliation. Back in 2014, the then Abbott government tried to change the Racial Discrimination Act to remove the provisions that make it an offence to \u201coffend, insult and humiliate\u201d, while introducing an offence of \u201cvilification\u201d on the grounds of race. Tony Abbott wanted to \u201cmaintain the red light for bigotry but remove the amber light for free speech\u201d.  The two largest Liberal state governments at the time, NSW and Victoria, opposed the changes.

Passengers were left stranded at a handful of airports when Bonza \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d all services on Tuesday with no notice, as the airline\u2019s owners considered the viability of the business\u2019 future. Bonza appointed firm Hall Chadwick for the administration process of its operating and holding company, documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) show. Bonza\u2019s fleet has been grounded until the end of Thursday, with the administrators advising passengers with booking not to turn up to the airport. \u201cDiscussions are currently under way regarding the ongoing viability of the business,\u201d Bonza\u2019s chief executive, Tim Jordan, said in a statement. \u201cWe apologise to our customers who are impacted by this and we\u2019re working as quickly as possible to determine a way forward that ensures there is ongoing competition in the Australian domestic aviation market.\u201d Bonza\u2019s board held an emergency meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the airline\u2019s next options.

The transport department opened a hotline on Tuesday morning for stranded Bonza passengers. The hotline number is 1800 069 244. \u201cI have spoken to Qantas and Virgin CEOs this morning and both airlines stand ready to assist stranded passengers needing to get home,\u201d King said.

Bonza\u2019s private equity owners, the US firm 777 Partners, had owned the airline\u2019s fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes. The parent company also part owns the Canadian low-cost carrier Flair and leases its aircraft assets between the airlines. Flair had some of its aircraft repossessed at short notice in 2023. Bonza had been operating two aircraft wet-leased from Flair in recent months, in addition to its fleet of four aircraft. One of the planes Bonza had been leasing from Flair appears to have returned to the Canadian carrier and was flying routes in North America on Monday. On 9 April, AIP Capital \u2013 an investment manager that includes aviation assets such as aircraft and which had majority owned 777 Partners\u2019 fleet of aircraft in a 51%-49% split \u2013 announced the formation of a new holding company, Phoenix Aviation Capital. When announcing its launch, Phoenix said it had \u201ca definitive agreement to acquire the rights, interests and obligations of a portfolio of 30 737-8 aircraft from 777 Partners\u201d. In an internal note seen by Guardian Australia, Jordan acknowledged to staff that the airline\u2019s fleet was repossessed by AIP, the effective lessor of the aircraft, on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis was a surprise to both ourselves and 777 Partners. We are currently assessing all options and will provide an update here just as soon as we have more information available to share,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consequence of this all first wave flights from all bases have been cancelled.\u201d Bonza, 777 Partners and AIP Capital did not immediately respond to questions about aircraft repossessions. Guardian Australia has previously reported that 777 Partners were being chased in court in the UK for almost US$30m (A$44.7m) in unpaid aircraft leasing fees and damages. Despite the legal issues, 777 Partners is now attempting to take over English football club Everton. The proposed takeover is awaiting approval from the English Premier League. On Tuesday, the Transport Workers Union (TWU) was seeking an urgent meeting with Bonza to discuss the implications for workers during \u201cthis difficult and uncertain time\u201d. In addition to offering to fly stranded passengers for free, Qantas and Virgin offered support to Bonza aviation staff. Qantas has set up a dedicated section on Jetstar\u2019s jobs website to recruit Bonza staff. \u201cThis is an extremely distressing time for workers and stranded passengers. Bonza must ensure staff are prioritised and informed as this process plays out,\u201d the TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said. \u201cBonza and any other airline attempting to enter the Australian aviation market has little chance of survival,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite speculation of issues behind the scenes at Bonza, this is an industry dominated by aggressive competition and unchecked corporate greed that will squeeze out any new entrant.\u201d Kaine echoed his union\u2019s calls for a broader commission into aviation to address competition, consumer and worker issues. \u201cAviation is an industry on its knees,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cService standards have plummeted while air fares have gone through the roof. Regional jobs and communities are now at further risk of being cut off as a more cost-effective airline struggles to stay in the air.\u201d Launched in January 2023 after a lengthy accreditation process during which its planes could not fly, Bonza has struggled with aircraft shortages and was forced to cancel several routes over the past year.

There were 77 grass and bushland fires burning along the New South Wales coast on Wednesday afternoon, including 35 that were uncontained. Only one fire\u2019s warning was upgraded to the \u201cwatch and act\u201d level, an out of control bushfire in the Snowy Monaro region, moving in a south-easterly direction. Extreme fire danger warnings were issued for greater Sydney and the Hunter region due to the hot and windy conditions. Over 400 firefighters were battling blazes across NSW with total fire bans in place.   Related: The BoM has finally declared an El Ni\u02dco. What does it mean \u2013 and why did it take so long?    Sydney was expected to break its September heat record on Wednesday afternoon, but temperatures peaked at 33.8C, a degree below what would have broken the record, and below the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s forecast of 35C. . The current record for Observatory Hill is 34.6C set in September 1965 and matched on Tuesday. If that mark was surpassed it would have been the hottest September day since records began in 1859. The BoM on Tuesday declared that Australia was now in an El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern that would further increase the chances of a hot and dry summer and heighten the risk of dangerous bushfires. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, warned the heat preceded what was expected to be a \u201creally tough summer\u201d. He warned communities needed to prepare. \u201cIt\u2019s September and we\u2019re already experiencing four days in a row of temperatures above 30C with high winds,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe are concerned about summer.

Miriam Bradbury, a senior meteorologist with the BoM, said it was \u201cunusual\u201d for such high temperatures to persist for such a long time in early spring. \u201cWe do sometimes get a few hot days coming through in September but usually they\u2019re at the end of the month and they usually don\u2019t hang around for a week and a half as this heat has,\u201d Bradbury said. \u201cHowever, we\u2019ve been seeing this heat building for a while now. We saw pretty warm conditions coming through since about July and that\u2019s continued through the later part of August and going into September.\u201d Bradbury said windy conditions coming off the ranges meant there was \u201creally dangerous conditions across the greater Sydney and greater Hunter regions\u201d. The heat was expected to ease by Wednesday night and into Thursday morning in NSW when temperatures were forecast to top 22C in Sydney. \u201cWe may possibly see a few very isolated showers about the coast, but really not expecting too much rainfall with this system at all. It\u2019s more likely just going to be a shift to much milder conditions through the later part of the week,\u201d she said. Bradbury said the extreme heat was expected to shift north with temperatures expected to hit 35C in Brisbane, 32C on the Gold Coast and 34C in Darwin on Thursday. \u201cOver the next couple of days that heat is going to shift northwards and start to exacerbate the fire weather conditions across parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory,\u201d the meteorologist said.

If we look at the long-term trends here, the temperatures are sneaking up all the time.\u201d The next two weeks will be critical for Australian farmers as crops start to run out of moisture. There is little to no rainfall forecast for the majority of cropping regions, temperatures are expected to be above average and livestock markets have plummeted over drought fears \u2013 forcing some farmers to rapidly reevaluate their businesses, switching from flood to a potential drought in less than 12 months. Hot and dry doesn\u2019t always mean drought Masoud Edraki, a senior hydrologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, says that although much of the east coast was seeing a reduction in soil moisture, that may not necessarily lead into drought. \u201cNot all El Ni\u00f1o years have led to drought situations,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is certain is that the conditions will be warmer and drier than average.\u201d Rural Bank\u2019s head of agribusiness development, Andrew Smith, says the coming fortnight will be critical for Australia\u2019s harvest of wheat, canola and barley as crops start to fill at a time when there is very little rain on the horizon. \u201cOur latest figures suggest that the grain harvest is going to be down around 35% on last year,\u201d Smith says. As Australia is coming off three years of record harvests, that sharp decline will only see this season\u2019s crop expected to drop down to the 10 year average. More worrying is an analysis by Rural Bank that showed severe deficiencies in root zone soil moisture in southern Queensland, northern New South Wales and northern Western Australia. Smith says the price for young cattle, measured through the eastern young cattle indicator, had dropped 50% since the start of the 2023 while slaughter rates remained high, suggesting people are not restocking their herds.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The situation has been exacerbated by three good years for rainfall, which led to a rapid expansion of the national livestock herds. According to 2023 projections from Meat and Livestock Australia, the national sheep flock was expected to grow to its highest level since 2007, climbing to 78.75m head. MLA also projected record lamb production. The national cattle herd was projected to reach its highest level since 2014, at 28.7m head. The dry season has changed that trajectory, and all those animals have to go somewhere if farmers have no rain. Angus Gidley-Baird, a senior analyst at Rabobank, says if farmers are highly exposed to the season \u2013 meaning if they find themselves without feed \u2013 they may make a sudden decision to offload livestock, which could test the meat processing system. \u201cThe first year is not the worst in drought; it\u2019s the second and the third,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how long things are going for, so some people are making early decisions.\u201d Gidley-Baird says mutton prices, for sheep aged over 10 to 12 months, have dropped from $120 to between $30 and $40 a head, but consumers might not see the lower prices in the supermarket. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lag in the system,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re buying today wasn\u2019t the animal that was grown yesterday. It will take a year to get there and it\u2019ll take time to process.\u201d Not just for farmers to worry about The dry spring and pressure on farmers has drawn attention back to Australia\u2019s drought policy. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told farmers told a Queensland drought summit this week that climate change could cost Australia $1.8bn in crop losses within 30 years if drastic action was not taken. His comments followed the release of a Productivity Commission report which recommended a major overhaul of the Coalition\u2019s $5bn future drought fund (FDF) to focus on programs that have a \u201clasting public benefit\u201d.   Related: Australia is seen as a safety net for protecting rare livestock breeds \u2013 but why do they need saving?    Kathy Rankin, the head of policy and advocacy at NSW Farmers, cautiously welcomes the report. She says the focus on place-based policy is positive, but is concerned the focus on sustainability and climate change might dilute the intention of the FDF. \u201cResponding to climate change and extreme weather events is something we all need to be prepared for, however making everything a climate change \u2018response\u2019 has the potential to diminish targeted programs,\u201d Rankin says. She says the FDF\u2019s value was in developing agricultural tools to handle climate extremes of drought, fire and flood.

The premier, Jacinta Allan, and health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, on Thursday released a long-awaited report on the Victoria\u2019s public health system. Among its 27 recommendations was a call to reduce the number of individual health services operating across the state, from 76 to 11. The report, by an expert advisory committee led by former Labor MP and health executive Bob Cameron, said such a move would bring Victoria into line with every other state and reduce \u201cduplication, inefficiency and competition between health services\u201d for staff.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cCurrently many administrative, compliance and clinical and non-clinical support functions are duplicated in each health service, resulting in inefficiencies that divert precious health resources away from patient care,\u201d the report said. But Allan said the government would not adopt the recommendation. \u201cWe will not be forcing hospitals to amalgamate because I\u2019m not convinced that that\u2019s in the best interest of patient care,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how under Jeff Kennett and the former Liberal government, they tried to go down that path. It didn\u2019t have a focus on patient care, and I\u2019m not prepared to do the same.\u201d She said it was possible for the government to adopt the remaining 26 recommendations without the need for amalgamations, via the creation of a new agency within the health department, Hospitals Victoria. Allan said the agency, to be led by current Northern Health chief executive, Siva Sivarajah, would work with hospitals to move them all on to the same payroll and IT system, as well as an integrated electronic medical record system.   Related: Why are some Victorian hospitals saying they\u2019re freezing recruitment and looking for ways to cut costs?    \u201cWe have too many different IT systems, too many different payroll systems, too much back-office bureaucracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we are establishing Hospitals Victoria as a dedicated agency to work with hospitals so they can remain firmly focused on frontline care, not back-office bureaucracy.\u201d Allan conceded some back-office jobs will be lost as a result of the changes but that there would be no impact to frontline services. She said the \u201clocal health networks\u201d recommended in the report will also be established, each with a formal relationship with a major tertiary, women\u2019s and children\u2019s hospital. Charles Maskell-Knight, a former senior federal health department official and health policy analyst, said other states had introduced similar changes as early as 2010, as part of a funding deal with the federal government. \u201cEvery state except Victoria either built on their existing regional structures or created new ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case for networking has been made on many grounds, not least the difficulty in ensuring good clinical governance for small standalone rural facilities, as well as the benefits of reduced duplication of back-of-house services.\u201d But Maskell-Knight doubted it would lead to significant savings \u201cin the scheme of things\u201d. \u201cI imagine if the 76 services could be consolidated into say a dozen networks, the annual savings after the dust had settled would likely be in the order of millions of dollars, rather than tens of millions,\u201d he said. An additional $1.5bn has also been provided to hospitals, who had earlier warned they would be forced to close beds, delay elective surgeries and sack staff if they were forced to rein in their budgets. At the time, the government said it had provided a record $8.8bn in funding in the May budget, which would cover deficits recorded by more than half the state\u2019s public hospitals. The hospitals were then urged to take measures to reduce deficits going forward. Public backlash ensued, which has been attributed to Labor\u2019s drop in primary vote share in recent polling. Several Labor MPs have said concerns that the party could be seen as \u201closing\u201d on the issue of health had prompted cabinet to agree to a \u201cpared-back\u201d response to the health services report and the allocation of additional funding, which will be included in the mid-year budget update. The opposition leader, John Pesutto, described the move as a \u201chumiliating backdown\u201d. \u201cThese funding cuts were never about efficiencies or better services, but mopping up the real-world consequence of a decade of financial mismanagement and record debt under Labor,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a dysfunctional circus this Allan Labor government is.\u201d Cameron\u2019s report had recommended the 11 \u201clocal health networks\u201d would be led by a single board and chief executive but would retain their independent branding. A similar structure is in place in New South Wales and Queensland, where there are 16 and 18 local hospital networks, respectively.", "In the new gold rush, farmers are asked to decide between food, carbon and renewable energy \u2013 but we need them all | Gabrielle Chan [2023-08-22T01:49:30Z]": "This week we are expecting representatives of a solar energy company to come to our farm in southern New South Wales. They want to build next door. We are not in a renewable energy zone but we are close to existing transmission lines. It is a traditional mixed agricultural area, with relatively safe rainfall by southern Australian standards. We are also classed as inner regional, close to population centres. In theory, we could grow food, energy or carbon.   Related: In Queensland\u2019s food bowl, farmers fear the gas bores from next door    One of the biggest issues that comes across my desk as a rural editor is the debate over changing land use. As with most rural issues, eventually it comes home. We are not alone. Across the country, communities are debating how best to plan for old and new land uses without much guidance or support from governments or the companies pursuing the new gold. Competing land claims range from food to mining precious metals to solar energy to wind turbines to carbon farming. Our stories about these issues \u2013 such as a windfarm in Nundle or a coal seam gas mine on the Liverpool Plains or the Darling Downs \u2013 are some of the most closely read and contested. The issue is not space. Australia is big. Farmers themselves need power so will be expanding their own power production. The issue is that everyone wants land close to existing infrastructure and populations to deliver food or energy at scale. While smart policy would accept that combined land use is the future, a key factor for farmers will be the potential returns per hectare. As Australian farmers have become some of the least trade protected in the world, the mighty dollar is the key determinant of survival in a dry climate. Will one hectare of food give a greater economic return than one hectare of solar panels or one hectare of carbon farming or one hectare of native habitat or biodiversity in the predicted \u201cgreen Wall Street\u201d markets? And how will this new use affect environmental assets such as ground and surface water, or infrastructure such as roads? These are the decisions farmers will be weighing up. The reality is, state and federal governments and Australians living in metropolitan areas are increasingly looking to regional landscapes to deliver affordable energy and greater emission reductions after more than a wasted decade of climate idiocy. At the same time, global corporations are hunting for carbon credits to offset business behaviours and production they don\u2019t want to change or have not changed fast enough.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  All of this must be done while increasing the volume and health benefits of the food already grown. Consumers are increasingly demanding cheap food produced with lower emissions, higher animal welfare standards and greater transparency. Australian food producers have been going like \u201cstabbed rats\u201d for the past three years to take advantage of higher commodity prices and three consecutive La Ni\u00f1as to grow more food. It was all very welcome, unless you were flooded out. Elsewhere, big trends continue to collide. There was a searing heatwave in Europe. Food inflation has been running rampant, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, higher input costs, higher labour costs, supply chain issues and in some cases increased supermarket profits.   Related: Australia\u2019s drought planning should begin now, not when the rain dries up | Gabrielle Chan    Nations are rethinking their food systems and keeping more in the larder. India, responsible for 40% of world\u2019s rice exports, recently banned exports of non-basmati white rice. It is just one example of a post-Covid world where countries and individuals want to become a little more self-sufficient. Equally, no nation wants to be living in energy poverty and Australia has the capacity to be a renewable superpower. Yet last week the Bureau of Meteorology forecast warmer and drier conditions for the coming months, saying \u201chigher than usual maximum temperatures are very likely\u201d. Previously optimistic farmers in our neck of the woods are countenancing a \u201cbobtail spring\u201d, cut short by higher temperatures and less rain. Firm policy guidelines are needed about how these climate and market forces hit the ground. A decade of denial from the Morrison government has led to a stampede to catch up to provide energy and carbon sequestration. There is a new gold rush, and it needs land. Consistent sensible land management policy that lasts more than one political term will be vital. Without it, rural communities will be susceptible to breathless campaigns like Tuesday\u2019s Rally Against Reckless Renewables, attended by the likes of Matt Canavan, who is suddenly worried about \u201cpristine rainforest and wildlife habitat\u201d. If you don\u2019t believe me, consider the valedictory speech of Andrew Campbell, who led the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, last month. At the National Rural Press Club in Canberra he was brutally honest about the challenge ahead for governments. \u201cPatchy, brilliant innovation has been accompanied by institutional amnesia, ad hockery and inability to stay the course,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often a change of government, a change of minister or razor gang in a tight budget has led to worthy initiatives being discontinued, useful organisations being abolished, or unproductive \u2026 No wonder episodes of Utopia are triggering for so many people in this town.\u201d There are critical independent decisions to be made with the national interest in mind. As to our own little land use decision, we will hear this energy company out and weigh up the benefits and the costs. How do you want us to make these decisions? Would you like us to produce healthy food or energy for electrification or sequester carbon or save and build habitat or all of the above? Because, frankly Australia, I am confused.

The fund, established at the height of the 2019 drought, was designed to provide $100m in annual funding to build regional resilience and prepare farmers for drought. So far, it has spent $65m in 2020-21, $72m in 2021-22 and $92m in 2022-23. The federal government commissioned the review of part three of the Future Drought Fund Act eight months ago to assess the effectiveness of the fund to support drought resilience activities.   Related: Parts of Australia suffer drought and low rainfall as La Ni\u00f1a and climate change create weather extremes    The review said that while the Future Drought Fund (FDF) was a \u201csolid foundation for drought resilience\u201d, it concluded there was a need for greater planning and more targeted programs to deliver long term transformational change and wider community benefits. \u201cOver time, it might be expected that there will be a shift in the types of activities undertaken through the fund,\u201d the review said. \u201cFor example, there may be greater specialisation in a smaller range of activities in areas where the fund is best able to generate enduring positive change. The result may be even fewer programs.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  It found there needed to be \u201ca stronger focus on activities that generate lasting public benefits\u201d. \u201cThe FDF should focus on activities that generate transformational change, build natural capital, and support a place-based approach to building social resilience,\u201d it said. It recommended rewriting the aim of the fund to focus on public benefits and climate change resilience, cutting back the farm business resilience program by tightening eligibility requirements, and streamlining two climate tools that were established to provide projections, economic analysis and advice on best practice into one service. \u201cThe Commission considers that the Australian Government should confirm that the FDF will only invest in drought resilience activities that are plausibly expected to lead to the Australian community being better off overall,\u201d the report said. It also recommended the removal of the legislated advisory role of the Regional Investment Corporation, dubbed \u201cthe Barnaby Bank\u201d, to the FDF. While the Productivity Commission report acknowledged some government drought support was appropriate, it said that taxpayer funds must show public benefit and promote changes that would not otherwise have been made. It was critical of the fund\u2019s aim that implied any activity that contributes to economic, social and environmental resilience in drought is a public good and could merit government funding. \u201cThis overlooks the fact that government resilience interventions also have costs, which can often fall to other sectors of the economy, and that many interventions offer benefits to a narrow group of individuals rather than to the broader public,\u201d the report said. The recommendations suggest a pivot away from individual business resilience training towards improving natural capital through natural resource management programs as this would provide benefits for farmers and the wider community. It added that the success or otherwise of the fund in building resilience would not be evident until tested by drought conditions. \u201cAt this stage the extent to which the fund is building drought resilience is unknown,\u201d the report said. The review was released one week after the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed Australia was in an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, with parts of the country already in drought. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, warned farmers on Tuesday at a drought summit in Queensland that Treasury analysis showed disasters and a warming climate would have large economy-wide effects. \u201cThe Productivity Commission\u2019s report highlights that drought is just one part of the larger climate change picture that means we need to focus not just on drought resilience, but broader climate change resilience too,\u201d Chalmers said.   Related: Queensland\u2019s rural debt balloons amid drought and rising land prices, report finds    Chalmers said the 2019-2020 bushfires and October 2022 floods each cost the Australian economy about $1.5bn. He added that Australian crop yields are expected to decline by 4% by 2063 due to the climate crisis, wiping $1.8bn off gross domestic product in today\u2019s dollars. Commonwealth funding under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) has increased by 433% over three years, he said, and Commonwealth spending on disaster recovery jumped from $335m in 2017-2018 to $2.5bn in 2022-2023. \u201cAs our climate warms into the future \u2013 potentially by 1.9 degrees here in Queensland over the coming three decades \u2013 we know that our farmers are on the frontline,\u201d Chalmers said. The productivity commission also recommended the department of agriculture establish a working group to help improve the design and implementation of the FDF for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, finding that Indigenous people did not participate in shared decision-making around the fund\u2019s objective, design, or governance. \u201cMany Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remain underrepresented in the sector.\u201d The federal government has to finalise the next four-year funding plan for the FDF by the end of February 2024. The Productivity Commission said that meant now was a \u201cnatural point\u201d to map the federal, state and territory government policies and programs that support agriculture, land management, drought resilience and climate change resilience and identify overlaps.

[2023-10-24T14:00:38Z]": "It has become a standard of bush politics, led largely by the National party, that city \u201clatte sippers\u201d don\u2019t understand country people. So it was noteworthy that in her valedictory speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday outgoing National Farmers Federation (NFF) president Fiona Simson declared that sort of rhetoric had had its day. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to curry favour in some parts of the bush by further wedging the city-country divide, by talking about \u2018us and them\u2019, by talking about the latte sippers and how they don\u2019t care, or they don\u2019t understand,\u201d Simson said. \u201cThat sort of talk though, in my view is not leadership. And it also ignores the fact that you can get a bloody good latte in Werris Creek or Gunnedah.\u201d Simson went on to say that the bush was changing and that farmers weren\u2019t conservative because \u201cany successful farmer embraces change and embraces new ideas\u201d.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The coffee strength may have changed in the bush but the politics remain firmly in the conservative camp as evidenced by any federal electoral map. So are things changing for farm advocacy? It is true that Simson was one of the first high-profile farm leaders on the national stage to acknowledge climate change science. It was a jarring reminder of the climate wars under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government that some of us were just quietly grateful when a farm leader acknowledged climate change made droughts worse in 2018. But the reality is farm advocacy has remained largely set in aspic, as neatly aligned with conservative parties as the union movement is with Labor. It is worth taking stock of this indisputable fact because, just halfway through the Albanese government\u2019s term of office, the NFF rhetoric has been steadily ramping up against Labor.  Farmer advocates are cranky about issues such as the live sheep export ban, industrial relations changes including on labour hire, water buybacks under the Murray Darling Basin plan, running transmission lines for renewables through farm land and negotiations on Australia\u2019s trade deal with the EU. On that last point, Simson said she would rather trade minister Don Farrell walk away from a \u201cdud deal\u201d than sign something that would dictate farmers fortunes \u201cfor a generation\u201d.   Related: The resounding no vote shows the great Australian silence lives on in the bush | Gabrielle Chan    Simson refused to be drawn specifically on the conditions that would meet the definition of a dud deal. But she said the EU\u2019s anti-land clearing laws were written for \u201cBrazilian rainforests\u201d and could capture what might be considered \u201croutine weed management\u201d in Australia. The NFF has argued Australian farming is unique and should be treated as such. In any case, the NFF this week gathered to vote for a new president to replace Simson and hold its annual conference. Candidates include former WA Farmers Federation president Tony York, AgForce Queensland president Georgie Somerset and former Victorian Farmers Federation president David Jochinke. It\u2019s highly likely the new president will be the public face of a war between farmers and the Labor government. There is discontent brewing, and a potentially stonking drought, presaged by an El Ni\u00f1o declaration and livestock markets falling like a stone as farmers offload excess stock, could bring it to a flashpoint. That\u2019s just business as usual, farmers at war with wall-to-wall Labor governments. It is hardly breaking news. What\u2019s new is that the NFF and traditional farmer organisations increasingly stand in contrast to groups such as Farmers For Climate Action, established specifically because the aforementioned groups largely refused to enter the global heating debate once the science became a partisan issue. Farmers for Climate Action began as a survey in 2016, and says it now represents 8,000 farmer members and a supporter base of 45,000. It appears to have become important enough to consult with, because the NFF brought it into the fold as a member organisation. The NFF\u2019s other members include the state farming  organisations and big corporate \u201cpartners\u201d such as Coles, Nufarm, McDonald\u2019s, Nutrien, WFI, Telstra, Rabobank and Prime Super.   The war between Labor and farmer advocacy may continue, but this new player provides a contrasting narrative that may leave the public \u2013 and the media \u2013 thinking about farmers as having a diversity of opinions, and not just as a bloc aligned with the National party.  Already we have seen counter arguments from Farmers for Climate Action on methane, where NFF opposed signing the methane pledge. It has held workshops throughout the country on balancing renewable energy developments and farming and even co-signed an open letter in support of the Indigenous voice to parliament, while the NFF remained silent. Labor is never going to win friends and influence many people in the bush but just like the climate, the advocacy is changing and that is going to make policy debates less predictable.

Here\u2019s what we know so far.  What did we learn about FMIA in this year\u2019s budget?  A lot. A six-page \u201cfact sheet\u201d and \u201cglossy\u201d overview brochure laid bare the budget\u2019s intent to deliver \u201cCost of living help &amp; a future made in Australia\u201d. The ambition looks grand with $22.7bn earmarked over the next decade. Large chunks will be spent as production subsidies, such as $6.7bn for hydrogen produced with renewable energy and $7bn for refining and processing 31 critical minerals. That spending mimics the tax credits offered by the much larger Inflation Reduction Act ($A557bn and counting) in the US. Given their nascent state \u2013 particularly when it comes to green hydrogen \u2013 the spending will take a few years to ramp up. The opposition treasury spokesman, Angus Taylor, has also flagged the Coalition would axe the \u201cbillions to billionaires\u201d scheme if it gets the chance before the money flows. Budget paper No 1 justifies the government backing of private projects like this: \u201cIn certain circumstances, targeted public investment can strengthen the alignment of economic incentives with Australia\u2019s national interests and incentivise private investment at scale to develop priority industries.\u201d If Australia pulls it off, the country will \u201cbe an indispensable part of the global economy\u201d, another budget publication states. Presumably, these industries may fill the void if coal and gas exports diminish \u2013 as they must if the world gets serious about climate action. Some of the spending is \u201cenabling\u201d. There\u2019ll be a \u201cnew front door\u201d to streamline investment and planning approvals, that has been welcomed by groups such the Investor Group on Climate Change. A $1.7bn innovation fund, $134.2m to boost workers\u2019 skills and a 10-year extension of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency will also aid the country\u2019s ambition to become a \u201crenewable energy superpower\u201d. Also bundled into the mix is regional support such as the $519.1m Future Drought Fund over eight years. Perhaps that\u2019s a nod to the future of a more volatile global climate that as one of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel exports Australia has helped to make. What other projects are included in FMIA?  What counts as a FMIA project was not entirely clear before Tuesday\u2019s budget. For instance, the $15bn National Reconstruction Fund, which is yet to approve any projects, will be part of the \u201cwhole package\u201d even if not all of its seven priorities neatly fit the bill. The $1bn Solar Sunshot, announced in the Hunter at the end of March, counts as one, as does the $400m in loans to Alpha HPA to deliver \u201cAustralia\u2019s first high-purity alumina processing facility in Queensland\u201d. So, too, does the $185m earmarked for Renascor Resources to develop a graphite mine in South Australia\u2019s Eyre Peninsula. The $940m investment in PsiQuantum to \u201cbuild the world\u2019s first fault-tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane\u201d is the largest single FMIA foray. Others are not so clear. In April, Bowen dubbed the $330m for nine industrial projects as \u201censuring a future made in Australia\u201d, although that money came from the $1.9bn Powering Our Regions fund. The $2bn Hydrogen Headstart program, announced in last year\u2019s budget, has also been added to the mix. \u201cClean, cheap renewable hydrogen is a vital part of a future made in Australia,\u201d Bowen said this month. In case the public thinks FMIA is only about fighting climate change, the $1bn deal with Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall to build 100 Boxer weapon carriers for export was also counted. The pact was foreshadowed in July last year, well before FMIA emerged, and the 2024-25 budget lists $15.3m over seven years as the subsidy cost. When did we first hear about the policy?  A future made in Australia is hardly an unusual collection of words so it\u2019s not surprising Anthony Albanese used such a combination years ago. In January 2022, months before becoming prime minister, he visited the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. \u201cIn everything from infrastructure and manufacturing to energy and innovation, we will champion a future made in Australia,\u201d he said. The PM visited the Hunter again on 28 March this year to formally launch the policy, with its clear decarbonisation theme: \u201cI want a future made in Australia. And I want a future made in our regions. We have every metal and critical mineral necessary to be a central player in the net zero transformation and a proven track record as a reliable energy producer and exporter.\u201dThe policy got a fuller airing two weeks later at the Queensland Press Club, including the announcement of a Future Made in Australia Act \u201cto anchor this reform and secure this growth\u201d. \u201cWe will bring together in a comprehensive and coordinated way a whole package of new and existing initiatives,\u201d the PM said of the act. What is in the FMIA Act?  No one knows, as details of the bill aren\u2019t public yet and it looks unlikely to meet the government\u2019s original 1 July target date for passing parliament.

The net zero carbon transformation is one main organising theme, with economic resilience and security the other one. Australian workers and businesses are intended to be the beneficiaries, the government says \u2013 emphasising one or the other, depending on the audience. FMIA\u2019s wide-ranging scope means it won\u2019t sit within a single minister\u2019s portfolio. Instead, the PM will lead collaboration with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, the industry minister, Ed Husic, and the resources minister, Madeleine King.", "Scientific body given just $100,000 a year to fight deadly fire ants, Senate inquiry told [2024-03-19T10:19:06Z]": "Australia\u2019s leading scientific research body received just $100,000 a year towards combatting fire ants, a Senate inquiry into the highly invasive pests has heard. \nAt the third and final session of public hearings for the Senate inquiry on Monday, the committee\u2019s chair, Senator Matt Canavan, said some of the evidence he had heard had \u201cfreaked [him] out\u201d. \nRed imported fire ants (Rifa) are believed to have entered Australia in the 1990s and were discovered at Brisbane port in 2001. A program spanning state, territory and federal governments was created to eradicate Rifa and has been allocated more than $1.2bn of federal and state funding. Of that, $593m covers 2023 to 2027. \nBut the CSIRO\u2019s executive director of future industries, Kirsten Rose, said the agency has only received about $1m \u2013 most of it government funded \u2013 towards combatting fire ants over the last 10 years, despite pioneering research in Rifa management including the development of a Rifa-specific novel genetic bait and drone surveillance technology. \n \n  Related: \u2018Wildly toxic\u2019 poison used on fire ants is killing native Australian animals, experts warn Senate inquiry  \n \nCanavan, the chair of the Senate rural and regional affairs and transport references committee, said that $100,000 a year \u201cdoesn\u2019t sound like a lot\u201d. \nFunds were more likely to be diverted to urgent eradication operations and other research bodies were also researching fire ants, the committee heard. \nRose was one of many witnesses who called for more funding towards eliminating the extremely damaging pest, which has now spread to more than 700,000 hectares in south-east Queensland amid a spate of recent detections in northern New South Wales. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nAngus Atkinson, the chair of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s sustainable development and climate change committee, said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about resourcing of the program and that farmers \u201cwould be really happy\u201d to be part of its governance. \n\u201cWe only manage 50% of the continent,\u201d he said, referencing the amount of Australian land dedicated to farms and agriculture. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to involve us.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nOver three days of hearings, the committee heard scores of testimonies underlining the immense scope of the problem. \n95% of Australia\u2019s landmass is suited to fire ants, according to the Invasive Species Council. Should the ants spread through Australia\u2019s habitat, the impact would be worse than the combined effects of rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats. \nUp to 650,000 Australians could be stung each year and the beef industry could be slashed by 40%. \n\u201cIt freaked me out, some of the briefings I\u2019ve had about the potential ramifications [of fire ants],\u201d Canavan said on Monday. \nMeanwhile, environmental experts have pushed back against claims made to the committee that chemicals used to kill fire ants may impact native fauna. \nJack Gough of the Invasive Species Council said that concerns over the health and environmental impacts of the pesticide fipronil in the fight against fire ants did not reflect the highly targeted and low levels at which the chemical is used by the eradication program. \n\u201cThis is being done in a targeted fashion at very low doses in ways that aren\u2019t comparable to the broad scale use of fipronil on crops. They are just such wildly different scales of use,\u201d he said. \n\u201cFipronil at high doses used indiscriminately clearly has high environmental impacts, particularly on insect populations. \n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no way the way it is being used [on fire ants] is going to have an impact on native animals, other than some highly localised impacts on native ants species that will quickly recolonise once fire ants have been removed from the area,\u201d he said. \nHe said the council had visited cane farms in Queensland where fire ants nests that had been injected with fipronil were now home to native ants. \n\u201cThe reality is that fire ants are a disaster for our native wildlife and their impacts far outweigh the very small localised impacts of this chemical,\u201d he said.", "Millions of Australians at risk of being stung by fire ants each year, experts warn [2024-01-30T14:00:38Z]": "Fire ants could sting 8.6 million Australians a year if they were to become endemic \u2013 but a pathogenic fungus and pesticide-loaded drones might help avert that scenario, according to submissions posed to the federal government\u2019s fire ants inquiry. \nSubmissions to the Senate inquiry into red imported fire ants (Rifa) in Australia closed on Monday, just days after the latest in a string of fire ant detections beyond south-east Queensland, where an infestation of the invasive pest is ongoing. \nLast week a single fire ant was found in an Australia Post package of plant material sent to Tasmania from Queensland. The non-reproductive female was detected by Biosecurity Tasmania as part of \u201cbusiness-as-usual surveillance operations at mail centres across the state\u201d. \nIn late January a fire ant nest was found in Wardell in northern New South Wales, while five nests were discovered in Murwillumbah, 13km south of the Queensland border, in November. It was the first time fire ants had crossed the Queensland border into NSW since the infestation began in 2001. \n \n  Related: Fire ants detected south of Byron Bay after gardener raises alarm  \n \nThe fire ants\u2019 march south has prompted a range of government, agricultural, health and research bodies and individuals to use the inquiry to call for resources and education to help stamp out the pest. Fire ant stings can cause anaphylaxis and death in humans. They can also damage electrical and agricultural equipment, kill native plants and damage ecosystems beyond repair. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nIn a joint submission to the rural and regional affairs and transport references committee, the National Allergy Centre of Excellence and Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia predicted that if fire ants were to become endemic, a quarter of the 8.6 million Australians who would be stung by fire ants each year would develop an allergic reaction, with 174,000 of those requiring medical attention. \nUp to 652,000 people a year would seek medical consultation because of Rifa stings, they said. \nThe Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy said \u201canaphylaxis is almost three times more common with Rifa stings than with other stinging insects\u201d. \nIn 2021 927 people were hospitalised after a bee sting and there were 12 deaths from wasps and bees, with 1% of bee stings causing anaphylaxis. That figure rises to 2.8% for fire ant stings, according to the society. \n\u201cTherefore, if Rifa became endemic in Australia it is likely that hospitalisations and deaths due to stinging insects would significantly increase,\u201d it said. \nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation told the committee that it was developing RNA-interference management tools that target fire ants, silencing their genes to kill or reduce reproductive potential. It is proposing laboratory-based risk assessments of a pathogenic microsporidium, or fungus, and a virus capable of killing entire fire ant colonies. \nIt is also researching the use of drones for biosecurity, including for the application of fire ant pesticide. \nDr Anthony Young, a senior lecturer in crop protection at the University of Queensland, described what he called the \u201cfailures\u201d of the national red imported fire ant eradication program after a fire ant nest was detected and reported in Karana Downs, Queensland. \nIt took a week for an eradication team to arrive at the property, only for the owner to watch \u201cin amazement as magpies swooped down\u201d to eat baited maize that was intended to kill the ant colony, he said. \nLast year state, territory and federal governments committed $593m to the national fire ant eradication program. A 2021 review said eradication would cost $2bn \u2013 equalling a single year of financial impacts should a nationwide infestation take hold. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nReece Pianta from the Invasive Species Council said its submission, which is one of a number yet to be published by the Senate committee, called for research into the health and environmental impacts of fire ants with a view to preparedness to protect sensitive environmental areas from invasion. \nHe said the council echoed Brisbane city council\u2019s submission which detailed suppression work within the Queensland containment zone, where the public is encouraged to self-treat their properties with free bait. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a full eradication effort but it is a good measure to keep the population slow while eradication is rolled out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s cost-effective.\u201d \nHe added that last week\u2019s Tasmania detection was \u201clow-risk but alarming\u201d, indicating that the ants \u201chave got to such a high density in Queensland that they are being found in household packages in a sorting centre\u201d.", "\u2018We deserve our fair share\u2019: state Labor leaders clash with federal government over infrastructure plan [2023-11-14T07:01:00Z]": "State Labor leaders are at odds with the Albanese government over its plan to split the cost of building nationally significant infrastructure. On Tuesday, the federal minister for infrastructure and transport, Catherine King, announced it would no longer be \u201cthe default\u201d for the federal government to pick up the bulk of the tab for new roads, rail and other major projects. \u201cWe are returning to a preference of 50-50 with the states and territories, so both levels of government carry an equal share of both the benefits and the risks,\u201d King said. Premiers and transport ministers from the nation\u2019s three biggest states responded with concerns. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told parliament that Queenslanders would be \u201cabsolutely shocked\u201d by the proposal, saying she had written to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, regarding the changes. \u201cWe will stand up to the federal government, we will stand up to the prime minister and say Queensland deserves its fair share and nothing less,\u201d Palaszczuk said.    The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about what the infrastructure funding plan would mean for Australia\u2019s largest state.\u201cThe commonwealth government has an arrangement with Western Australia, which means effectively that NSW could be worse off from the GST payments in the years ahead, we\u2019ve got a state commonwealth health agreement that hasn\u2019t been signed that sees NSW lose out an enormous amount of money because of the complete collapse of GP services in the community,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cTaxpayers pay a lot of money in income taxes to the commonwealth government and we deserve our fair share.\u201d The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said her state had historically struggled to secure even 50-50 funding agreements with the federal government. \u201cFor too long on too many projects here in Victoria under the former federal Liberal National government, there was no funding split,\u201d Allan told reporters on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt was zero funding that we got from Canberra on Metro Tunnel, on West Gate Tunnel, we\u2019ve removed 72 level crossings without $1 from the federal government. \u201cFunding splits ... and what the federal government\u2019s thinking on that is very much a matter for them. I\u2019m very much focused on ensuring that ... we do get our fair share of funding.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u2018Concerning\u2019: fears for regional infrastructure The Victorian transport infrastructure minister, Danny Pearson, said King would be turning her back on regional communities if she introduced a 50-50 split across the board, given the federal government had committed huge funds to several projects outside Melbourne. Under the new infrastructure statement, the federal government plans to focus on a narrowly defined category of \u201cnationally significant\u201d infrastructure, projects which cost at least $250m, or align with national priorities, among other requirements. \u201cIt would be concerning if the federal member for Ballarat, Minister King, sought to walk away from regional Victoria, that would be concerning and disappointing,\u201d Pearson said.\u201cGenerally the projects that tend to be funded 80-20 are more regional and rural projects.\u201d The Queensland transport minister, Mark Bailey, complained that the sunshine state had already been left behind by the former Coalition government, urging the Albanese government to maintain existing funding arrangements on \u201ccorridors of national significance\u201d.    He also demanded the commonwealth exclude any infrastructure required for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics from any cuts and that regional and south-east Queensland be left no worse off.\u201cAny deviations from the currently agreed 80-20 funding split on regional corridors and 50-50 on urban corridors will significantly disadvantage our regions which are amongst the most decentralised and road transport reliant in the nation,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWe are the only state with the majority of our population in regional areas.\u201d The Grattan Institute transport and cities program director, Marion Terrill, said previous federal governments had tended to pick up more of the bill for rural projects \u2013 but the last government had funded as much as 100% of the cost of some schemes, particularly small-scale pork-barreling schemes such as car parks at railway stations. Terrill said as state governments are responsible for building infrastructure projects, it made sense to ask them to bear more of the risk of a blowout if they don\u2019t do so in a cost-effective way. \u201cThey will be on the receiving end of a more disciplined approach to commonwealth spending,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s understandable that they weren\u2019t that thrilled about it.\u201d   Related: Infrastructure projects face axe amid $33bn in cost blowouts, Catherine King says    Megaprojects under threat as cull looms King said the government\u2019s review of the commonwealth\u2019s $120bn \u201cinfrastructure investment pipeline\u201d found it would \u201cnot be possible\u201d to deliver all planned projects. Under its new infrastructure policy statement, the federal government plans to spend the same amount of money on projects but set stricter limits on which ones it funds and subsidise them less, making federal money go further, she said. Speculation is building as to which of the 800 works budgeted by the previous federal Coalition will survive the new government\u2019s \u201cshort, sharp\u201d 90-day review. At least some projects are expected to be outright cancelled by the commonwealth, when the report on the $120bn pipeline of projects is released in coming days. On Tuesday, the Melbourne Airport CEO, Lorie Argus, stressed the airport\u2019s dream of an underground train station linking it to the city\u2019s rail network could not be cut nor scaled back without broader negative implications for the city. \u201cA rail connection is critical,\u201d Argus told the Australian Airports Association National Conference. \u201cWe need another mass transit solution to the airport and we\u2019re very committed to that.\u201d Other megaprojects under threat as part of the review include a fast train line between Melbourne and Geelong, rail serving the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, an extension of Canberra\u2019s light rail network, upgrades to the Great Western Highway out of Sydney, and other road upgrades across the country.

In the 10 years to June 2019, SEQ\u2019s population grew at more than twice the rate of the rest of the state. And that population is forecast to grow by another 2.2 million people by 2046, bringing the number of people living in SEQ to 6 million. Rapid population growth can create great opportunities for residents, but it can also present challenges. From housing to green spaces, and entertainment precincts to transport networks, planning for new residents is a complex process. If you are a resident of SEQ, the current stage of the planning process is a vital time in which you have your voice heard and help shape what this future community might look like. Expansion or higher density? As people move to a new area, it can put a strain on what\u2019s already there. Existing infrastructure can\u2019t support an extra 2 million people without some changes. These extra bodies can cause issues such as housing stress, making it difficult for residents to find suitable places to live close to work. A growing population also adds pressure to services such as public transport, schools and hospitals, and can stretch job opportunities. When this happens, governments effectively have two options: they can keep building out, or they can work to fit more people into the same space. Both solutions present challenges. Expanding brings concerns around urban sprawl, environmental impacts and accessibility, while higher density can create congestion and affect liveability. But population growth in SEQ is inevitable. One way or another, changes must be made to accommodate new residents. Growth can be a catalyst for positive change With an influx of new arrivals comes the chance to invest in the whole region. Done well, growth can enhance what already exists. For example, an area might become the location for expanded green spaces, new education and health facilities, and more art and lifestyle precincts. As new facilities are developed, and new industries arrive, they can provide jobs growth and greater career opportunities. The Queensland government wants to make the most of SEQ\u2019s growing popularity, and population. It is currently reviewing the South East Queensland Regional Plan. The new version of the plan is also known as ShapingSEQ 2023, which the government calls \u201ca plan to shape the future growth\u201d of 12 local government areas: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Moreton Bay, Noosa, Redland, Scenic Rim, Somerset, Sunshine Coast and Toowoomba (urban extent). The new plan, which is currently in a draft phase, sets a long-term vision for SEQ, showing how the region can grow, not only quickly, but sustainably, and without losing the essence that makes it so appealing. The government says the plan is \u201cfocused on housing supply and diversity in housing choice, supported by a refreshed approach to economic centres and jobs, biodiversity and infrastructure planning\u201d. Involving communities in the planning process can help decision makers include in the plan what residents actually need. Community opinion can have a big impact Contributing to government plans in their early stages can have a significant effect on their outcomes. The draft of ShapingSEQ 2023 Update is now open for consultation, which means residents can read it and respond with their own thoughts and ideas. The government says feedback received will be considered in finalising this document and in future initiatives related to population growth and housing supply.

The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares) forecasts average cash incomes to fall to $197,000 per broadacre farm in 2023\u201324, with beef cattle and sheep farms expected to be hit particularly hard. The forecast warns some farms will find it difficult to repay debt, which has increased over the past few years at the same time as interest rates have climbed.   Related: Australian farmers are coming off three bumper years. Are they prepared for the sudden dry?    Recent Abares figures show farm debt has accelerated each year since 2016-2017, primarily for land and working capital, though farm equity remains strong due to rising land prices. It comes after El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern was declared and livestock markets plummet as farmers sell off stock to reduce herds ahead of an expected dry summer. But the latest Abares farm performance forecast says the expected income falls are relative to the record highs for farm incomes over the past two years. \u201cForecast farm incomes and profits for 2023\u201324 are still expected to be above those observed during recent drought years at a national average level,\u201d it says.   Interactive Farm incomes are forecast to drop sharply from historically high levels.   The forecast covers broadacre farms, which represent 95% of farmland in the country but a little over half of the value of production, because it excludes intensive industries such as dairy, horticulture and poultry. In 2023-24, below average farm profits are likely for parts of southern Victoria and South Australia, and Western Australia in areas affected by both adverse seasonal conditions and declining sheep, lamb, and wool prices. In northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, below average farm profits are expected to be primarily driven by the climate\u2019s impact on crop production. However, central and central-north Australian conditions are forecast to remain more favourable, with expected farm cash incomes only forecast to decline 14% compared with 41% nationally. Neal Hughes, a senior economist at Abares, said the new forecast combines a farm simulation model with a drought early warning system linked to the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s seasonal weather forecasts and related crop and pasture growth estimates. \u201cThe commonwealth government relied pretty heavily on data from the BOM but drought is generally a lot more complicated than just rainfall,\u201d he said.   Related: Solar power and a composting toilet: what it takes to live off the grid in regional Australia    \u201cSome of Aabres\u2019s past research has shown \u2026 rainfall can only be weakly correlated with the actual agricultural impacts of drought.\u201d Hughes said the new forecasting system will help government programs \u2013 such as the Farm Household Allowance and the Rural Financial Counselling Service \u2013 to plan for the needs of communities. But he said it was important to recognise that the commonwealth would not be returning to the old system where drought maps defined which farms were in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and government assistance was paid according to certain criteria. \u201cIt\u2019s important to emphasise that it\u2019s not about returning to some kind of exceptional circumstances type trigger,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the government has a lot of programs that are related to drought that could benefit from drought information. \u201cIf we can forecast where drought is happening, and what might happen in the future, potentially that could have helped them allocate resources.\u201d", "A wing and a prayer: flying doctors and the struggle to access healthcare in remote Australia  [2023-08-19T20:00:28Z]": "Belle Kidd was eight months and ten days old when she died in Brisbane\u2019s Mater Hospital. Born with primary pulmonary hypertension, Belle was not destined for old age but neither was she destined for a life solely within the confines of white hospital walls. \u201cI wanted to take her home so she could pat the dogs and touch a horse,\u201d mother Helen Kidd says. \u201cWe took her on the four-wheeler and for a swim in the Cooper.\u201d Home for Kidd is a cattle station at Windorah in far western Queensland. The only option for air travel is a mail plane that flies to Brisbane twice a week. The Kidd family were often on board, assisted by the Patient Travel Subsidy Scheme - a government initiative to provide financial aid to access medical services not available locally. But when the mail plane did not align with Belle\u2019s appointments it meant a 14-hour 1200km road trip to the hospital. In Belle\u2019s last days the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) transported her back to the Mater. \u201cIt was an amazing thing,\u201d says Kidd. \u201cI heard the sound of that big plane coming in and when the Mater retrieval nurse stepped out with Belle\u2019s file I felt a rush of calm because you feel so helpless on your own when you can\u2019t help the ones you love,\u201d she says.    When it was time for the final journey home Angel Flight took Belle\u2019s tiny coffin and her distraught parents, flying low over the station in farewell before landing. Years later, Kidd\u2019s second child, Charlie, required major head surgery in the same hospital where Belle died. Her husband, Dude, also needed the RFDS after a motorbike accident. The RFDS treated 387,042 patients in 2021-2022 and transported 45,347 people via plane and 72,775 via road to hospitals.

Foran spent three days in Dubbo Hospital and was about to be discharged when a visiting locum from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) noticed she couldn\u2019t walk straight and arranged an emergency CT scan. \u201cWithin an hour they had diagnosed me with a brain tumour and I was put into intensive care there and then, before being flown to RPA [Royal Prince Alfred, Sydney],\u201d Foran says.    \u201cI was given steroids to shrink the brain tumour and then, via caesarean section, I gave birth to Jake. He was born with a hole in his lung, hyper insulin anaemia and jaundice. In the next four months I developed diabetes, had 16 hours of surgery on my head, suffered a stroke on my right-hand side, spent three weeks in intensive care, a week in neurosurgery, developed meningitis, and was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. I had pain in every joint, struggled to walk, talk and eat but finally I was allowed home to my son \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t do anything for him.\u201d Jake was diagnosed with eye cancer a year later. The family had moved to Goondiwindi in Queensland, and began the medical round-about again with a new hospital in a new state. After five years Jake made a full recovery, as did Foran. It wasn\u2019t their last medical emergency: Foran\u2019s husband, David, had a farm accident three years later which required RFDS transport.    The experience motivated her to help other families.

", "Industry and states put pressure back on federal government over paid university placements [2024-02-29T04:24:52Z]": "The federal government is facing mounting pressure to fund mandatory placements, with states, students and industry warning failure to act will worsen ongoing workforce shortages amid a cost-of-living crisis. The Universities Accord report, released on Sunday, received \u201cstrong feedback\u201d from students about the burden of unpaid internships and called on government and industry to fund stipends. A range of vocational degrees including nursing, teaching, physiotherapy and counselling require up to 1,000 hours of unpaid placements \u2013 equivalent to six months\u2019 work. Under the recommendation, the commonwealth would work with universities and employers to introduce payments, with governments to fund nursing, care and teaching.   Related: Cutting debt and paid internships: key reforms in the Australian universities blueprint    But the national president of the Australian Physiotherapy Association, Scott Willis, said if allied health practices were relied upon to fund placements, \u201cthere would be none at all\u201d. \u201cIf there was a reliability on practices to pay students, I can guarantee placements would cease immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cPractices don\u2019t get paid [for placements] and it requires a significant amount of energy and resources. The only ones that can [fund it] are the government.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Prof Christine Morley from the school of public health and social work at Queensland University of Technology also pressed the federal government to foot the bill, contending allied health industries provided a \u201csocial service\u201d to society. \u201cIt\u2019s not a private enterprise like engineers where you have corporate firms that can fund placements,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re a different kettle of fish. \u201cIt\u2019s a cleaner solution if just the federal government were involved \u2013 once states and the commonwealth are talking about who pays for what it can end up not happening.\u201d Isaac Wattenberg, who heads a group called Students Against Placement Poverty, said recommending employers pay for sectors other than nursing, teaching and care went against \u201cdirect recommendations\u201d from students and academics, while the definition of what constituted \u201ccare\u201d was also unclear. \u201cResearch shows that relying on employer-funded placements increases competition by limiting the amount of organisations that are able to host placement students,\u201d he said. \u201cVocational placements are often difficult for students to secure and many fields already lack adequate numbers of placement opportunities to support the number of students required to undertake placement hours.\u201d State education ministers are still holding out for discussion with the education minister, but have placed the onus on the commonwealth. The New South Wales deputy premier and education minister, Prue Car, said her government had already awarded a payrise to teachers, adding \u201chigher education course funding is a commonwealth responsibility\u201d. The Queensland minister for education, Di Farmer, said paying students for compulsory placements was a \u201cgood idea\u201d that would be a welcome cost-of-living support, but didn\u2019t commit to contributing to it, while Victoria\u2019s minister for skills and Tafe, Gayle Tierney, said the government was \u201cclosely reviewing\u201d the accord\u2019s recommendations. The Greens deputy leader and spokesperson for education, Mehreen Faruqi, said no matter how it were legislated, paying students for mandatory placements must be an \u201cimmediate priority\u201d for Labor, particularly amid a cost-of-living crisis. \u201cUnpaid placements are really taking a toll on students as they are pushed into poverty or forced to drop out,\u201d Faruqi said. Morley agreed. She said it was crucial funding was introduced in the May budget to address chronic workforce shortages, adding the stipend should be equivalent to the national minimum wage, not be means tested and include international students. A survey of 1,000 social work students conducted by Morley in 2022 found 96.3% experienced challenges during placements, and a quarter lost up to 75% of their income. \u201cEverybody I speak to in the sector is desperately concerned at not being able to attract workers, particularly in regional and rural areas,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would be absolutely life-changing. I\u2019ve had people contact me saying \u2018when is this happening \u2013 I\u2019ve been wanting to study for years and putting it off because I can\u2019t afford to do the placements \u2013 if this comes in, I\u2019m going to enrol tomorrow\u2019. \u201cI can\u2019t stress how urgent this is for the sector.\u201d The education minister, Jason Clare, was approached for comment.", "Solar power and a composting toilet: what it takes to live off the grid in regional Australia [2023-10-02T14:00:16Z]": "It may not look like everyone\u2019s idea of a dream home but for Tim Dakin this converted shed in East Gippsland represents financial freedom and self-sufficiency. Located 7km out of the small town of Briagolong, the shed is now a comfortable home. Dakin bought the property on a whim with his ex-wife more than two decades ago, and has spent the past eight turning it into a fully off-the-grid residence. \u201cWe literally stumbled across this property that was advertised in Burger Bill\u2019s fish and chip shop in Briagolong, we met the owners then and there and decided to buy the property on that day,\u201d Dakin says. Working in the arts, Dakin has never had a stable income. He says living off-grid has given him a new sense of agency and control over his budget.    Off-grid homes have a growing appeal in regional Australia, thanks to rising energy costs and the high cost of connecting a new build to mains power. Reducing costs and addressing environmental concerns, by living a more sustainable lifestyle, often go hand in hand. But the upfront costs can be considerable. Dakin was quoted up to $65,000 to build off-grid systems for his home. Instead he installed a modest battery system, new solar panels and a small water pump for about $20,000. He now runs his petrol generator only twice during winter, down from once a week when he first moved in.

But Smith says the increasing affordability of renewable energy technology, such as solar panels, has made it a more viable and comfortable option. On the New South Wales south coast, David Griffiths has built a timber off-grid house on a 25-acre bush block between Bega and Merimbula. Griffiths and his wife live in Queensland and initially bought the land as a holiday getaway which would just house a self-contained caravan. They have since upgraded their vision: they bought a two-bedroom, 50 square metre house for $35,000 from a local kit home company and are now putting the finishing touches on the kitchen, bathroom, and composting toilet. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty livable, and there\u2019s always more projects you can do to improve life in an off-grid environment,\u201d he says. The timber frame of the house is 70mm thick, providing excellent insulation. \u201cIt acts like an esky,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you keep it all closed up [in summer], it\u2019s cool inside all day \u2026 [in winter] we\u2019ve got a little woodburning stove, and if you fire that up in the morning when it\u2019s cold it heats the place up within an hour and then it stays warm all day.\u201d Griffiths originally planned to set up a 12 volt system of batteries and solar panels. The property also has a 240-volt inverter system \u2013 bigger than they need, Griffiths says, with the power to run \u201ca couple of fridges\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have \u2026 and it just makes life really easy,\u201d he says. \u201cReally, you only need the power for lighting. So you could run off 12 volts quite happily.\u201d    The longevity of these systems is yet to be tested. Reece Stubbs, the general manager of the sustainable architecture firm The Sociable Weaver, says while they can do modelling of solar systems to calculate the lifespan of the product, \u201cthere\u2019s not too many off-grid homes that have been sitting there for 50 years, tried and tested\u201d. People like Dakin are on the frontier.  For the first time in his life, 25 years after buying the property, he says he feels secure knowing he has a home he can afford on an ongoing basis.

Positioned directly behind her, but still in the camera shot, Crisafulli frowned sympathetically and shook his head as she told her story.    Robbie Katter called this week as he saw it, describing regional parliament as \u201cwindow dressing\u201d and renewing his longstanding call for self-determination for northern Queensland. \u201cThere\u2019s a large chasm developing,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere is a deep divide between the values of people in the north and in the south and as evidenced by the policies that we get run over us.\u201d The premier brushed off Katter\u2019s calls, saying \u201cQueensland is best when we are united and we are one\u201d. \u201cThat is one of the main reasons that I said that we would be bringing the parliament to Cairns and to the far north, so we can engage directly,\u201d she told parliament.

The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has argued that the system \u2013 which determines which regions need additional resources \u2013 is flawed and is exacerbating rural GP workforce shortages.   Related: Australian bowel cancer screening age should drop from 50 to 45, medical research authority says    Doctors trained overseas are crucial to easing GP shortages across the country because for their first 10 years in Australia they must work in areas of need, known as a distribution priority area, to access Medicare benefits. The DPA system, which is being reviewed, identifies geographic areas with a shortage of GPs by examining the remoteness of an area, the socioeconomic status of its patients, and the number of Medicare billings. DPA classification is updated annually. But rural towns on the city and regional fringes say their status is being boosted by their non-rural neighbours in the same geographic area that attract more GPs. As a result, they are missing out on DPA status and struggling to attract the international doctors they once relied on to fill workforce gaps. Dr Farza Rastegar is the owner of the only GP clinic in Pearcedale, a town an hour and a half south-east of Melbourne in the City of Casey local government area, which is classified as metropolitan.

This is despite Pearcedale having a mixed population that includes significantly disadvantaged people, according to Rastegar. The median weekly household income in Mount Eliza is more than $500 greater than in Pearcedale, according to the latest census data. Rastegar said since the clinic\u2019s seven GPs had dropped down to four, the centre has not been able to replace staff with internationally trained doctors available to work. \u201cI already know someone who is happy to start soon,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t get him because he only moved from the UK three years ago, so he hasn\u2019t done his 10 years.\u201d  The centre will close on Fridays from 1 November due to the struggle to find enough staff, she said. \u201cIt is putting the community in a panic mode.

Several GP practices in rural fringe areas including towns along the Sunshine Coast such as Buderim, Caloundra, Maroochydore and Noosa, as well as clinics in the Victorian town of Wallan have also experienced staffing issues after missing out on a DPA classification. Dr Anita Munoz, the Victorian chair of the RACGP, said Pearcedale was an \u201cimportant case because it just goes to show why this classification system isn\u2019t working\u201d. \u201cThe issue of the rural and regional medical workforce is a true example of a wicked problem \u2026 there will be no single one initiative that will solve this,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cBut until we start to sophisticate the way that we measure areas of need, we will probably continue to misclassify areas and create new gaps where others were nonexistent, and then failed to fill gaps that we\u2019re not recognising.\u201d   Related: Young people think vapes aren\u2019t harmful because they are so easy to buy, study finds    Peta Rutherford, the chief executive of the Rural Doctors Association, said remoteness modelling was often a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d and it was significantly affecting patients on the fringes of capital cities or larges regional centres.

Two days a week she drives her four-year-old son, Max, and two-year-old daughter, Audrey, from the family\u2019s farm in northern Victoria to the nearby town of Rushworth, where Audrey is dropped off at the local daycare centre. There the family meets another local mother, who drives Max and her own child to kindergarten in the town of Colbinabbin, 20km in the opposite direction. After school there\u2019s a similar reciprocal scheme: Barlow\u2019s friend takes Max after kinder for an hour and a half until the work day ends, while Barlow ferries her friend\u2019s younger child home from daycare.

And unless she can work something else out, Barlow will have to cut back to one day next year, as her friend\u2019s child is moving on from daycare to kinder and the reciprocal arrangement will no longer be viable. \u201cWhile the kids are this age, I can\u2019t progress in my career,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be fully registered this year but I can\u2019t find that time.\u201d    Many parts of the region where Barlow lives, Loddon Campaspe in northern Victoria, are what the Mitchell Institute at Victoria University calls a \u201cchildcare desert\u201d: where there are at least three children under five for every available childcare place. In Loddon that number rises to 33 children per place. In Campaspe, which includes Colbinabbin and Rushworth, the female workforce participation rate is 53.4% \u2013 significantly lower than the national rate of 62.1% for all women over the age of 15. In nearby Loddon and in Gannawarra, which abuts the Murray River, it\u2019s even lower at 46.5%.    Getting people to move here and find a house is almost as hard as getting childcare  Paul Fernee     The region desperately needs workers. Council representatives from Campaspe and Gannawarra told Guardian Australia they had worker shortages in healthcare and social welfare services, emergency services and all levels of education. But with a huge shortage of childcare, too, parents who want to work often can\u2019t. The local children are also affected by the scarcity of early learning opportunities. A report submitted by Regional Development Australia Loddon-Mallee to the Productivity Commission review of the childcare sector said one in three of the region\u2019s 19,000 children arrived at the first year of school not ready to learn. Numbers alone don\u2019t tell the story of the extraordinary hurdles that families in the rural area have to overcome to access childcare.    Jacinta Sutton lives in Boort, 30 minutes\u2019 drive south of Kerang, in Loddon shire. Since moving there a year ago she has secured one day of long daycare for her three-year-old daughter, Molly, in Kerang. It\u2019s in the opposite direction to where she works in Charlton. Her husband takes Molly to daycare on his way to his work as a diesel mechanic at a large local farm but he is then late to work because the centre doesn\u2019t open until 8am, which is when he is supposed to start. Two days a week Sutton\u2019s mother- and father-in-law, who live locally, help out. On the fourth day, her mother drives 120km each way to look after Molly at their house. Sutton says she feels guilty having to ask for help from Molly\u2019s grandparents. And the intellectual and emotional juggle of managing precarious care is a huge burden, she says: if one element of the system fails, the whole lot collapses.   Related: Behind the bush learning boom: why getting dirty and lighting fires is good for Australian children    \u201cIt makes your working life so much harder,\u201d Sutton says. \u201cYou end up doing your work life, personal life, family life \u2013 everything \u2013 very inefficiently, because there is just so much in your head.\u201d Paul Fernee, the director of community wellbeing at Gannawarra shire council, says a significant amount of the workforce pressure in the region could be alleviated with more childcare options. \u201cGetting people to move here and find a house is almost as hard as getting childcare, but people who are already here can\u2019t get childcare and can\u2019t get back into work,\u201d Fernee says. \u201cA great example is our Kerang police station. It has five vacancies we\u2019re aware of that they can\u2019t fill. We\u2019ve got schools crying out for teachers. Our hospital in Cohuna and community health service in Kerang are crying out for nurses, hospital workers, doctors.\u201d Fernee says he knows of one candidate for the police roles who couldn\u2019t come back to work because they couldn\u2019t get childcare.   Interactive   Promises but no follow-through In Gannawarra, the council is the only provider of early childhood education and care, as commercial operators do not see it as a viable market. Fernee says different, non-market-based models are needed to make childcare in rural and regional areas viable \u2013 such as co-locating services with kindergartens, primary schools and maternal child health centres.    Higher subsidies would also be required from the government to offset the running cost shortfalls, Fernee says, but it is hard to get the state or federal governments to prioritise investment or to understand the potential positive flow-on effects. Jo Bradshaw, communities director at Campaspe shire council, says occasional care options that would allow parents \u2013 such as Barlow \u2013 to work casually or on shifts to fill staffing gaps at schools or the hospital at short notice do not exist. \u201cThere certainly would not be the spaces in any of our childcare centres to do that because it\u2019s all taken up by permanent users,\u201d Bradshaw says. She says she understands the local secondary school is paying relief teachers to travel up from Melbourne. State and federal governments appear to be listening to the challenges they face, Bradshaw says, but they haven\u2019t yet seen any material follow-through. \u201cPeople are happy to come to the table.

No-grounds is still a legal and acceptable way of a landlord requesting his property back.\u201d No-grounds evictions across Australia A no-grounds eviction, as the name suggests, allows a landlord to evict a tenant without any reason, regardless of how long they have lived there or how well they may have looked after it. In NSW, about 30,000 renting households each year receive a no-grounds eviction. The national number is unknown. Most jurisdictions have restricted when they can be imposed, but only two \u2013 South Australia and the ACT \u2013 have blanket bans. Queensland and Tasmania ban no-grounds evictions for month-to-month or periodic tenancies but they are legal at the end of fixed-term leases. In the Northern Territory and Western Australia they are legal at any point in a tenancy. In Victoria they are legal only at the end of the first term of a fixed-term lease. Leo Patterson-Ross, the chief executive of the Tenants\u2019 Union of NSW, says about 200,000 households a year meet that condition. \u201cSo although it\u2019s a relatively restricted range, it\u2019s actually still a lot of people, almost a third of renters in Victoria.\u201d The NSW government has said it will implement a ban, but there is no timeframe for when it might be introduced. The minister for better regulation and fair trading, Anoulack Chanthivong, says imposing a ban is not straightforward. \u201cWe\u2019re working through the complexity of reforms to end no-ground evictions carefully because renters deserve better than changes that risk unintended consequences, like higher lease turnover or less supply,\u201d Chanthivong says. \u201cThere is no nationally consistent approach to this challenge, and we\u2019ve seen models in some states that haven\u2019t worked as intended.\u201d    Tenancy advocates argue that the existence of no-grounds evictions means tenants may hesitate to ask for repairs in case they are seen as unreasonable. Leanne Pilkington, the president of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, says there are strong protections in every state and territory against unreasonable evictions. \u201cA good renter will not be subject to eviction, just like a good driver will not get a speeding fine,\u201d Pilkington says.

The 1,000-bed facility near Toowoomba hosted 730 people during the Covid-19 pandemic, amounting to a cost to taxpayers of more than $300,000 per patient. The state government entered into the contract with the Wagner family in September 2021 \u2013 less than two months before a national review recommended states and territories should begin stepping down quarantine requirements.   Related: Labor considered turning Covid quarantine facilities into domestic violence shelters    In a report published on Friday, the state\u2019s auditor general, Brendan Worrall, said while the procurement process was reasonable, other information should have been fully considered by the state government. This included Queensland\u2019s progress towards vaccination targets, agreed relaxation of quarantine requirements under the national plan and \u201ceffective\u201d alternatives such as hotel quarantine, the report said. Queensland received the proposal for the facility in January 2021, and later requested the federal government split the cost, however that was denied. Instead, the Morrison government announced it would build a second facility at Pinkenba, near Brisbane airport. But with an independent consultant identifying risks with the Brisbane site, the state in August signed a contract to help build Wellcamp on the Wagners\u2019 land, which the family would own and lease back to government.

The auditor general found the procurement process undertaken by the state was reasonable but said the government could have been more forthcoming with the costs. Until last July, the government had declined to outline the full cost of Wellcamp, citing commercial in-confidence arrangements. Despite the confidentiality provisions in the agreements, the government should have considered disclosing Wellcamp\u2019s total value once the agreements were signed, the report said. It made three recommendations to improve the disclosure of information. These included expanding the definition of reportable contracts, updating the use and disclosure of confidentiality provisions in government contracts and for the department of premier to develop guidance for ministers answering questions in parliament when confidentiality provisions are in place. Palaszczuk confirmed the department had rejected the recommendation to develop guidance for ministers, saying they would do so on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d. \u201cWhat we can do is be a bit more transparent about those contracts,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the states also need to keep their competitive advantage \u2026 it\u2019s up to the individual minister to look at those projects.\u201d Deputy leader of the opposition, Jarrod Bleijie said the Wellcamp quarantine facility was a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d and a \u201cget-square with the federal government\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t listen, and they didn\u2019t care about wasting taxpayers\u2019 money on a political hatchet job,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201c$223m of taxpayer money was spent on a white elephant that was barely used and didn\u2019t even meet requirem\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adents.\u201d", "Police in Australia examine conspiracy theories behind shooting deaths of two officers and four others [2022-12-13T12:27:25Z]": "In a remote patch of Australian scrub, Gareth Train was building his \u201cark\u201d. \u201cThe name given to me is Gareth,\u201d he wrote, introducing himself to an online forum for conspiracy theorists and survivalists in January 2021. \u201cI currently live on my rural property in western Queensland were [sic] I have been building an \u2018ark\u2019[,] homesteading for the last five years preparing to survive tomorrow.

Darling Downs Health executive director for rural health, Dr Christopher Cowling, said the district only knew of the imminent staff shortage one day prior. \u201cWe absolutely acknowledge that having a doctor available in any town is vital, which is why we took immediate action as soon as we were aware of an imminent staff shortage in Tara earlier this month,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we only knew about this one day prior to the temporary bypass, it\u2019s a real testament to the swift planning that took place in the face of unpredictable staff shortages.

[2023-07-30T00:00:09Z]": "Think of mining and you may imagine gaping great holes such as the iron ore mines of the Pilbara or cavernous underground workings of the copper mines of Mt Isa. In outback New South Wales, the mining of Australia\u2019s national gemstone looks quite different. Opal mining is the home of the one-man operation, where small-scale miners prise opal from the earth often with no more than a jackhammer and a rickshaw. Opal is not kind to the commercial miners who chase defined resource targets. As one miner puts it \u201copal doesn\u2019t follow rules, opal is where it wants to be\u201d.   Related: White Cliffs NSW: where life is lived underground and the desert \u2018does all sorts of strange things\u2019    Australia supplies 95% of the world\u2019s opal. But mines at Lightning Ridge and White Cliffs, the main opal production hubs in NSW, are currently under threat. In May, the department of mines and regional NSW instructed 858 miners to stop work, after a review found 3,343 mining claims granted between 1 January 2015 and 13 February 2023 were invalid. Opal mining on those 50m by 50m plots of land ground to a sudden halt. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even notified,\u201d says Petar Borkovic, a second generation opal miner. \u201cNo one in the industry knew anything about it until one of us was in Dubbo and saw the minister on Channel 7 news saying the opal industry was being shut down. \u201cThen, of course, everyone went into panic mode. The department goes on about safe working environments [for local staff] but they\u2019re not doing that when they upset 800 miners. It treats the whole industry with disrespect.\u201d After revealing the error, the department began a title revalidation program that required miners to re-apply for their claims, and refunded the fees paid by those whose claim was found to be invalid. Natural resources minister Courtney Houssos held meetings in Lightning Ridge and White Cliffs in an attempt to clear the confusion.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  In a statement to Guardian Australia, Houssos says she understands \u201cthe importance of opal mining to the Lightning Ridge and White Cliffs communities\u201d and had apologised on behalf of the government for the disruption. \u201cMy focus has been on getting miners back on their claims as soon as possible in accordance with the law,\u201d she says. As of early this month, the department had received 429 applications to re-approve mining claims and 218 claims had been re-issued or resolved. Some $46,680 in administrative fees and levies had been refunded to affected miners. Miners remain worried. Opal mining in the South Australian town of Mintabie was shut down in 2019, and the Queensland government in 2022 instituted a 12-month moratorium on granting new opal claims.    Lightning Ridge opal miner Kelly Tishler says she fears they \u201ccould be looking at the last generation of opal miners\u201d. \u201cThe average age of an opal miner is 63 and these are people who work remotely, live off-grid, don\u2019t have access to internet, don\u2019t have access to many mod cons, but prefer to live that way, and they are being asked to adhere to rules that are more in line with coal mining and big business,\u201d Tishler says. An independent review into the statutory framework for administration and regulation of small-scale opal titles is currently under way. However the Lightning Ridge Miners Association (LRMA) says the reform should be swiftly introduced to reassure the industry. The LRMA says it felt the lack of support for the industry from government to be \u201cquite disconcerting\u201d. \u201cThe recent changes are creating, for our members, a lot of confusion, uncertainty and doubt as to the future of this industry,\u201d LRMA general manager Kavitha Barron says. \u201cWe are lobbying the minister to make a couple of changes to the regulations that will at least reinstate over-the-counter titles while they are reviewing the entire legislative framework.\u201d Barron says the stop work order had financial impacts on the small communities, from those who work in opal production to wholesalers and retailers. \u201cThis has had a flow-on affect to global markets,\u201d she says.

Graeme Downton has been living and mining in White Cliffs for 30 years. His home is a five-bedroom dugout, an underground home cut straight out of the rock. He also operates an opal shop. Both are on leasehold land and cannot be converted to freehold.    The area is held as native title claim by the Barkandji people. In 2021 the Barkandji Native Title Corporation signed an Indigenous Land Use Agreement with the NSW government to grant permanent leases to people living in dugouts at White Cliffs. State housing minister Melinda Pavey said the agreement was a \u201cwin-win\u201d because it provided permanent security for residents while recognising Barkandji claim to the land. Barkandji Native Title Corporation chairman Leroy Johnson says he understands the concern of people in White Cliffs but says the lease agreement is working.   Related: Inside Cadia, the NSW goldmine at the centre of an environmental dust-up    \u201cResidential leases can be handed down through wills or sold at market value and native title doesn\u2019t have any say on who they get sold to, though we have negotiated for a first right of reply [in lease sales],\u201d he says. \u201cThe residents pay for those leases the same as they always have so there\u2019s no change.\u201d But negotiation over the granting of mining claims is ongoing. Downton says the opal industry has been left in limbo. \u201cIn August 2018 the department stopped granting new applications and we can\u2019t reapply until native title is resolved,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a commercial operation I get no compensation for that and I\u2019ve got a quarter of a million dollars\u2019 worth of equipment sitting idle in the yards.\u201d Mining leases do not necessarily extinguish all native title rights, meaning non-exclusive native title with some limited rights could still be granted over areas currently subject to opal claims.

That\u2019s according to the Anglicare rental affordability snapshot, the Anglicare chief executive, Kasy Chambers, told the National Press Club on Tuesday. The 2023 snapshot, released before the federal budget last month, analysed 46,000 rental properties across Australia, based on whether rent would cost more than 30% of the household budget for various low-income households. Chambers was speaking as part of a panel on housing affordability in regional Australia. She said when Anglicare began its rental affordability snapshot 10 years ago, there was a belief that regional areas were more affordable.

Some regions are worse off than others: in central Queensland, she said, only nine of the 397 rental listings analysed in the report were affordable for a couple with two children who both lived on jobseeker, and on the New South Wales north coast, only 8% of rental listings were affordable for a couple who had two children and both worked full-time in minimum-wage jobs. \u201cWe do not see affordable housing in regions any more,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in effect buying the number of available jobs through the price of your rent or mortgage.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Chambers said skyrocketing rents in regional areas were having flow-on effects on other services such as aged care, as pensioners living in private rentals decided to move into residential aged care facilities earlier than they otherwise might because they cannot keep pace with rent. She called for a return to fully publicly funded social and affordable housing, rather than relying on the private sector and schemes such as negative gearing, capital gains tax concessions and commonwealth rent assistance. \u201cWe now spend more commonwealth dollars per capita on those three payments than we ever did on housing, and yet housing affordability has never been lower,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone can see that this approach is failing.\u201d Anna Neelagama, the chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, and the independent MP for Indi, Helen Haines, were also on the panel. Neelagama said house prices and rental supply issues in regional Australia had cooled since 2021 and were now back at pre-pandemic levels, but that had not resulted in an increase in the number of affordable rentals available. She suggested the federal government use some of the $60m allocated under the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to pay local governments to write to ratepayers in an effort to get \u201cempty or latent homes\u201d back in the permanent rental pool. \u201cThe Eurobodalla shire on the south coast did this and successfully got 18 new properties back into their rental pool,\u201d she said.  Neelagama also suggested an audit of land and houses owned by state and territory governments, to free up any police or teachers\u2019 houses that were standing empty and government-owned land which was being land-banked and not developed. She suggested Australia should also look at prefabricated or modular homes \u2013 \u201cany homes we can get in the ground quickly\u201d \u2013 as a way to house key workers.

The CoreLogic Australia economist Kaytlin Ezzy said the declines recorded in some of these markets were not surprising. \u201cOver the past year, premium lifestyle markets have been hardest hit by softer market conditions and rate increases,\u201d she said. \u201cThese markets were among the largest beneficiaries of regional migration through the Covid-induced upswing and, as a result, became significantly more sensitive to the rising cost of debt and the normalisation in regional migration trends.\u201d House values in the Richmond-Tweed region surged by 51% during the pandemic, before rising interest rates, booking property prices and the lingering impacts of the 2022 floods saw values fall -24.2% over the year to April.

The regions with the longest-selling time were the southern highlands and Shoalhaven, with an average of 79 days on the market. The new data comes as Sydney recorded a new low in rental listings, with the number of new listings falling 17% month-on-month in April on realestate.com.au, the lowest it had been in a decade. According to the new PropTrack Market Insight, this was the fewest new listings since April 2012. New rental listings across the country fell by 18.9% month-on-month, the largest fall since 2017. Total listings fell -16.5% in the past year in capital cities, led by Melbourne (-31.3%), Sydney (-15.7%) and Perth (-19.2%). PropTrack\u2019s director of economic research and report author Cameron Kusher said the results reflected a deepening of the rental crisis across the country. \u201cI think in Sydney and Melbourne, there\u2019s potentially more that it could drop. Just because we know that migration to Australia is really strong and we know that most migrants tend to settle in Sydney and Melbourne,\u201d he said. Kusher added that supply would continue to be a problem, leaving a \u201cvery tough market\u201d for renters. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to continue to be a problem and the main reason for that is supply takes time.

Once you start selecting a limited number of production traits \u2013 meat quality and quantity for example \u2013 you often lose other traits. By having a hearty gene pool of rare breed animals you can cross-breed traits such as thrift and vigour back in.\u201d Having genetic diversity in pigs may mitigate the severity of disease that can be transferred to humans, Brown says. The Japanese encephalitis virus outbreak in 2022, which was discovered in 80 piggeries and led to 40 reported cases of the virus in humans, six of which proved fatal, is just one example of the severity of such diseases.   Related: Sticky beef: why Australia\u2019s supermarket meat prices remain high despite falling livestock markets | Matt Dalgleish    Due to the prolific number of pig diseases around the world and the pig\u2019s propensity to transfer these diseases to humans, Australia has a closed-door policy on the importation of live pig genetics. That places all eight remaining pig breeds in Australia on the Rare Breeds watchlists. \u201cEven though people think there are heaps of Large Whites and Landrace in the commercial piggeries because they are all white pigs, they are actually different strains and the original species are vulnerable,\u201d Brown says. \u2018Insurance against disease or disaster\u2019 On the northern outskirts of Brisbane, Cathy Newton shares her life with a range of poultry listed on the Rare Breeds watchlists \u2013 endangered Orpington and Khaki Campbell ducks, critical Magpie ducks, and vulnerable Mallards and Cayuga. She also has rare Silver Laced and Gold Laced Wyandotte chickens. Newton says high production demands and a preference for fast-growing birds led to the development of hybrid poultry species which today make up most commercial poultry flocks.    \u201cIf any problem were to happen with those, we have the rich genetic resource of the pure-breed flocks to fall back on,\u201d she says. \u201cOur rare livestock breeds may be thought of as insurance against disease or disaster and should be preserved for biological, agricultural and scientific purposes.\u201d While the recent census shows we are losing many of these rare breeds, it is not all doom and gloom. Some breeds, such as British White and Ayrshire cattle, have increased in numbers to a level where they have been removed from the Rare Breeds lists. But while other countries have a livestock gene bank, Australia does not. The Rare Breeds Trust is calling for funding to create an Australian gene bank, but lacks the government support. \u201cWe have no financial backing and unfortunately cannot get registered as a charity as we don\u2019t fit into the existing descriptions,\u201d Kleynhans says. \u201cWe\u2019re a volunteer trust so we don\u2019t have a lot of money to go around buying [genetic] straws.\u201d In the mean time, Newton says back yard livestock and poultry owners can help in the preservation of rare breeds by choosing their next animals carefully. \u201cAs the price of eggs continues to rise more people will see the value in keeping hens or ducks,\u201d Cathy says. \u201cAnd if keeping them, why not keep some beautiful and special rare breeds?\u201d  Mandy McKeesick is a writer from central Queensland.

For the past seven years, the 59-year-old has been taking photos of a wide variety of birds on her property in Dereel, south of Ballarat in western Victoria. \u201cIt has started becoming an addiction,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful creatures and every time I take a photo I see something I haven\u2019t noticed before. \u201cI\u2019ve been through bouts of anxiety so for me it\u2019s about getting away from it all, and being in the bush and taking photos of these birds really does it for me.\u201d    Among her favourites is the pink-eared duck, which is one of eight native ducks listed as a game species in Victoria. This means they can be legally shot by duck hunters during the 12-week open season. The Victorian government is facing pressure to outlaw duck hunting, after a parliamentary inquiry recommended a complete ban on the practice on both public and private land from 2024. If the government accepts the recommendation it will bring Victoria into line with Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, which have banned duck hunting. The inquiry also recommended reserves used for duck hunting be converted into parks to provide \u201cgreater access to outdoor recreation for all Victorians, with appropriate investment in camping, boating and related infrastructure\u201d.   Related: \u2018I\u2019ve got the best job in the world\u2019: waterbird expert wins prestigious Eureka prize    Lisa Palma, the chief executive of Wildlife Victoria, says the recommendations are a cause for celebration. \u201cThe future of our precious Victorian wildlife just got a little bit brighter,\u201d she says. But Labor MPs are already facing lobbying from duck hunters and unions who want the activity to continue. \u2018An amazing bird\u2019 For birders like Moyse there is much more pleasure to be had in shooting ducks with a camera. \u201cAs far as ducks go, it\u2019s at the top,\u201d Moyse says of the pink-eared duck, which is also known as the zebra duck or zebra teal.    \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating duck. So gorgeous with its pink ears and it has this distinct call so you know exactly when there\u2019s one flying around.\u201d Over the past couple of months, small flocks of pink-eared ducks have settled at a farm near Moyse\u2019s property and at other waterholes around Ballarat. Named after the tiny pink spot behind their eye, the ducks are specialist feeders. They have a spatulate bill, like the Australasian shoveler, with hairs that filter out food as they vacuum up water on the edges of wetlands. They are common, settling around the Murray Valley and throughout western Victoria, but their exact location can be hard to pin down: they are nomads, following rainfall to the best water courses.    \u201cShallow, recently flooded wetlands are their favourite spots,\u201d says Roger Thomas, a naturalist and bird lover from Ballarat. \u201cIf [the areas] are wet for years at a time they\u2019re not of much interest to the pink-eared duck. \u201cThey\u2019re not in the Ballarat district all the time but we do have sightings nearly every year. They\u2019re certainly a very appealing little duck and every bird lover likes to see one.\u201d   Related: Endangered glossy black cockatoo being lured to South Australian mainland with 20,000 trees    Prof Richard Kingsford, an ecologist at the University of NSW, says the development of dams that divert water upstream of the floodplains \u2013 which pink-eared ducks depend on for food and breeding grounds \u2013 has contributed to habitat loss, which is impacting the species\u2019 numbers. Kingsford says the ducks tend to concentrate in large numbers in wetlands, making them more vulnerable to duck hunting. \u201cThe pink-eared duck is an amazing bird. It\u2019s probably my favourite duck in the world,\u201d Kingsford says. \u201cIt has amazing colouring, but they are also incredible animals \u2013 true nomads of our desert rivers and wetlands when they flood. They are also a spectacle when they fly in tight flocks, twittering to each other.\u201d Kingsford conducts the annual eastern Australian waterbird survey, for which surveillance flights will begin next month for the 2023 edition. The monitoring program, which has been running for 40 years, has provided key data in the argument against duck hunting.    The survey remains essential even if duck hunting is banned, Kingsford says, as uncertain weather patterns caused by the climate crisis are likely to impact the habitat and populations for a wide range of Australian water birds, not just those targeted by shooters. Moyse shares Kingsford\u2019s concerns. \u201cA lot of different species of ducks are losing their habitats left, right and centre, and then you add the shooting to it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to wipe out a lot of these birds. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much against the whole hunting thing.

Last year Lonely Planet picked KI as one of Australia\u2019s top 20 travel experiences and this year Tourism Australia named Stokes Bay the nation\u2019s best beach.    The state Labor MP Leon Bignell\u2019s kelpie, Dusty, was just five weeks old when he rescued him from the 2020 fires. The former tourism minister said his favourite spot on Kangaroo Island was Stokes Bay. \u201cThere are these signs saying \u2018to the beach\u2019 \u2026 it doesn\u2019t look that promising but then you emerge through these little gaps in the rocks,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come out the other side and there\u2019s the most amazing beach.\u201d Bignell said the agricultural sector had picked up since the fires and the island\u2019s economy had also been helped by a surge of domestic and intrastate visitors during the pandemic. \u201cFive hundred kilometres of coastline, and even at the height of summer you can find a spot where you are totally on your own or have hardly any people around you,\u201d he said. The endangered Kangaroo Island dunnarts appear to be making a comeback despite their habitat being ravaged by the bushfires, while the Ligurian honeybee is still struggling. There is a plan to eradicate feral cats on the island by 2030, to help the dunnarts along with native birds, the Kangaroo Island echidna, and the southern brown bandicoot. There are, of course, plenty of kangaroos, along with wallabies, sea lions and platypuses. Scientists are in the process of luring the endangered glossy black cockatoo over to the South Australian mainland, where it has been extinct for decades.

But along a narrow stretch of the Murray River, one league has decided to go it alone. It\u2019s the second time in six years that the Picola and District Football and Netball League (PDFNL) has de-affiliated from the AFL. \u201cLots of footy people in the regions have had a gutful of the city-centric AFL and the affiliation system,\u201d says Tim McCormick, the senior coach at Mathoura Football and Netball Club, which plays in the PDFNL. \u201cIt feels like the AFL doesn\u2019t get country footy; doesn\u2019t care about the health of the game at the grassroots. They just take the fees and give little back.\u201d   Related: Lance Franklin kicks 1,058th-career goal in milestone 350th AFL game    McCormick has played, coached and been an administrator in clubs and leagues across Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland for close to 40 years. He has watched with growing disillusionment as the AFL has increased its administrative influence over local football.  Picola is the only Aussie rules league in Victoria not affiliated with the AFL in the 2023 season. A spokesperson for the AFL says the fact that the remaining 82 football bodies are affiliated \u201csuggests that the benefits of affiliation far and above are better than the unaffiliated\u201d.    But conversations playing out in football and netball clubrooms across the state suggest cracks are starting to show. The catalyst for the latest round of discussions is the shock decision to strip the Wangaratta Magpies of the 2022 Ovens and Murray premiership, after the club was found to be $28,000 over the $125,000 salary cap. Wangaratta was issued a $28,000 fine, payable to the AFL. A senior administrator from a club playing in a premier league, who asked to remain anonymous, said those fines \u201cnever filter back\u201d to the local game.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cWhat does that money deliver to country footy?\u201d they said. \u201cDoes it help clubs get more umpires? Or run junior programs? Or alleviate any of the pressure on a dwindling number of volunteers who keep grassroots clubs alive? Does it keep struggling clubs alive? \u201cI doubt it. It goes into the AFL coffers. (At best) it might be another bloke walking around in an AFL polo shirt somewhere.\u201d A spokesperson for the AFL said the fine would go toward \u201ceducation and supporting clubs in the management and integrity of the Community Club Sustainability Program\u201d. A ruling from \u2018on high\u2019 Criticisms of the AFL\u2019s administration of local leagues centre around the salary cap and the player point system, which the AFL says is designed to promote \u201ceven and fair\u201d competitions. The points system allocates a value to footballers based on their playing history and achievements, with considerations for junior development, club loyalty and other factors. A player who has played at least one game in the AFL in the past three years is worth six points; a junior player who has been at the same club for three seasons, or has never played for another club, or an adult player who has not played anywhere for the past three years, is worth one point. McCormick says both systems are inflexible and do not work for smaller, more isolated communities. \u201cThey want leagues to run in a uniform and consistent way but every league, every situation is different and that\u2019s what the Picola league has tried to get across,\u201d he says.   Related: \u2018There\u2019s too much money in local footy\u2019: the bidding war for Aussie rules footballers    \u201cYou set a salary cap from on high. But that doesn\u2019t mean every club has that much money to spend. And then there\u2019s the [player] points system, which is very cut and dry and doesn\u2019t seem to take into consideration what\u2019s actually happening on the ground.\u201d In the 2022 season, he says, the senior football team at his club lost five games by more than 200 points, and still more by more than 140 points. The obvious solution, he felt, was an increase in \u201cplayer points\u201d which would allow them to bring in more competitive players. But while a few clubs were offered more player points by AFL Victoria, it wasn\u2019t enough to ensure competitiveness. Now that PDFNL is unaffiliated, \u201cwe were able to plead our case to the Picola board direct and got more points \u2026 and we\u2019ve been much more competitive this year as a result\u201d.  McCormick is also critical of the AFL\u2019s approach to development, which he says is often based on \u201csetting up a heap of junior leagues in larger centres\u201d. \u201cAll of a sudden you\u2019ve got clubs with two or three under-10, under-12 and under-14 teams,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have that many kids playing footy, but where do they all go when they graduate to senior footy?\u201d    A spokesperson for the AFL says while junior participation numbers in country Victoria show the game is growing overall, the organisation \u201crecognises there are challenges, including population shifts and other factors contributing to some clubs experiencing player number shortages\u201d. \u2018A framework for everything\u2019 Greg Watmore, who has had an almost decade-long involvement with Tocumwal Football/Netball Club \u2013 which switched from the PDFNL to the nearby Murray Football and Netball League this season, in part because of the de-affiliation \u2013 says while imperfect, the current system is the best on offer. \u201cI agree with affiliation and was deadset against Picola [league] leaving,\u201d Watmore says. He says the AFL affiliation provides \u201ca framework for everything\u201d. \u201cYou might not like all the rules, because of course they\u2019re not tailored to suit individual clubs or leagues, they\u2019re tailored to suit everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIt guides clubs in relation to transfers, suspensions, how match days run, player points, salary caps, umpire abuse, clearances \u2026 everything. I think it\u2019s too complex for individual leagues to manage.\u201d In a response to Guardian Australia, the AFL rejects criticisms of its administration of country football and says the feedback it has received is that the system is working well. It says each region is governed by locals \u201cwho generally have strong connections to community clubs and are well informed\u201d. \u201cThey are best positioned to manage a region within one framework but apply localised regulations and decision-making based on the evidence available to them,\u201d it says in a statement.    It adds that \u201cno decision will please every club\u201d but that every league has \u201cthe opportunity to be consulted on the development and setting of [salary] caps\u201d.  \u201cA small number of clubs seek additional travel or salary cap assistance and applications are never rejected without a process which the club submits to,\u201d the statement says. It says AFL Victoria is \u201ccommitted to directing support to where it\u2019s needed most\u201d, including \u201cinvestment in dedicated club development leads in regional areas, to provide on-the-ground, localised support to clubs and the volunteers who drive the success of community football\u201d. Shane Railton, the operations manager of the PDFNL, says many other league administrators are watching how the 2023 PDFNL season unfolds, with a view to potentially doing the same in the future. He says he believes affiliation agreements are about the AFL \u201camassing control\u201d and that while local commissions are meant to give voice to what\u2019s happening at the grassroots level, \u201ceverything is seemingly driven out of head office\u201d. \u201cI think the issue with the AFL is they don\u2019t get that there is so much variation in football,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be ideal to have a one-model-fits-all and that\u2019s what they want, but that\u2019s not how it works.

They won\u2019t be spending it at shops, they\u2019ll be paying their bills. We\u2019ve got to do something to help people being wiped off their feet.\u201d \nUsing taxation statistics and figures from the Parliamentary Budget Office, the Australia Institute has calculated a winners and losers list in terms of benefits from the final stage. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe Tasmanian electorates of Lyons, Braddon and Bass are least likely to benefit from the tax reforms, with researchers estimating just $130m in combined value will flow through to people living in those seats. \nThe seat of Spence in South Australia and Maranoa in rural Queensland round off the bottom five. Hinkler in regional Queensland, Franklin in outer metro Tasmania, Lyne and Page in rural New South Wales and Nicholls in rural Victoria finish off the bottom 10. \nThe institute calculates taxpayers in the bottom 20 electorates \u2013 including Blaxland, Fowler, Lingiari, New England, Mallee, Wide Bay, Calwell, Kingston, Indi and Monash \u2013 will pay just $1.1bn less tax in 2024-25 because of the stage three changes. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nBy comparison, taxpayers in the top 20 electorates that are expected to benefit \u2013 led by independently held North Sydney, Wentworth, Warringah, Curtin and Tanya Plibersek\u2019s electorate of Sydney \u2013 will pay $4.8bn less tax in that same year. \nTaxpayers in the top five electorates will pay less tax due to stage three than the bottom 20 electorates combined. \nMatt Grundoff, senior economist at the Australia Institute, said the tax cuts would just widen the divide between the city and the bush, rich and poor. \n \n  Related: From stage-three tax cuts to welfare relief: what\u2019s on Australia\u2019s 2023 budget wishlist?  \n \nLambie\u2019s colleague Senator Tammy Tyrrell said it was now up to MPs to advocate for their communities. \n\u201cTake a look at Lyons,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting the least of any electorate in the country.

The ban comes into place on Tuesday, when temperatures in the city are expected to reach 33C. The last total fire ban covering Sydney was on 29 November 2020. The service has also declared a total fire ban on the state\u2019s far south coast, where the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe heatwave warning, with temperatures not falling below 18C for three consecutive days and nights. Extreme fire conditions are forecast for the south coast on Tuesday and in Sydney and the Hunter Valley on Wednesday. On Monday, a vast swathe of Australia entered its fourth consecutive day of well above average heat, delivering elevated fire dangers and an early start to an unusually hot and dry warm season. Northern Victoria, inland NSW and inland South Australia were all forecast to record temperatures from 10C to 16C above average on Monday. Port Augusta in SA was predicted to reach 39C, Penrith in NSW was set to reach 37C and Sydney was forecast to hit 31C. Dean Narramore, a meteorologist with the Bureau of Meteorology, said the sustained period of high temperature across numerous parts of Australia was \u201cvery unusual\u201d, particularly for the time of the year.   Related: Sydney marathon runners hospitalised after event hit by spring heat    The deep band of heat has been caused by a large, slow-moving high pressure system dragging warmth from central and northern Australia into the south-east. September heat records were broken in South Australia on Sunday, where Ceduna hit 39.8C. With the heat moving eastwards, temperatures were expected to rise further in NSW on Tuesday and Wednesday. The heatwave is set to break on Wednesday, when a cold front will sweep across the entire south east, bringing strong winds, showers and even some snow for parts of alpine Victoria and Tasmania, Narramore said. Sydney is likely to drop from 34C to 21C when the cool change arrives that evening, bringing gusty winds and some showers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be back to average temperatures, but after a hot week that\u2019s going to feel like a shock,\u201d Narramore said. On Monday morning the NSW Rural Fire Service responded to grass fires in Riverwood, south-west Sydney, and Kangy Angy, north of Gosford. A bushfire in Razorback, north of Picton, was also under control.

By Monday, residents in affected areas were being told to stay informed and avoid smoke.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  James Haig, the executive manager for bushfire mitigation at the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, urged bushfire preparedness after an early start to the bushfire season. \u201cYou can see from the recent fires in Queensland, the bushfire season is well and truly on us so, please, make sure you\u2019ve got a bushfire survival plan,\u201d he told ABC News. \u201cWe want people to understand what they\u2019re going to do and be able to implement a plan made in advance.\u201d The Australian Red Cross echoed the call, with new data indicating just 10% of people are taking steps to actively ready for emergencies, despite 58% of Australians \u2013 more than double the figure of five years ago \u2013 likely to be affected by heatwaves during the next 12 months. The Red Cross\u2019s Penny Harrison said concern of emergencies was not translating into active preparation. \u201cWe know the better prepared you are, the better your capacity to respond and recover from any emergency.

Now experts say it\u2019s being exploited [2023-11-18T23:00:33Z]": "Three months before Bob Hawke joined with Pacific leaders in the Cook Islands to sign a landmark new anti-nuclear treaty, the local newspaper carried an arresting headline. \u201cPACIFIC \u2013 A REGION OF \u2018PEACE\u2019 \u2013 AND BOMBS FOR FRANCE,\u201d thundered the Cook Islands News on Saturday 11 May 1985. The French defence minister had turned up in Noumea to declare the country had no enemies in the Pacific \u2013 but the platitudes were greeted with scepticism because just hours earlier France had carried out its 69th nuclear test in French Polynesia.   Related: Climate crisis and China-US rivalry: five top takeaways from the Pacific\u2019s most important summit    These heightened concerns permeated the region in the months leading up to the crucial meeting in the Cook Islands in August 1985 where leaders endorsed a nuclear-free zone. Hawke, the Australian prime minister at the time, hailed the negotiations as a \u201cdramatic success\u201d that would send \u201ca clear and unequivocal message to the world\u201d, with the treaty leaving major powers in no doubt about the region\u2019s desire to preserve \u201cthe South Pacific as the peaceful region which its name implies\u201d. But nearly 40 years after the Treaty of Rarotonga came into force, the region is on edge about another rise in geopolitical tensions \u2013 and critics say gaps in the treaty\u2019s coverage are now being exploited. \u201cThe treaty was really important to a lot of people, especially for grassroots activists,\u201d says Talei Mangioni, a Fijian-Australian board member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons Australia. \u201cBut it was quite watered down. And so even though we celebrate it today, what activists were saying in the 1980s and what progressive states like Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu were saying was that it wasn\u2019t comprehensive enough.\u201d Mangioni, who researches the legacy of the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific Movement, adds: \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s left us now with things like Aukus exploiting certain loopholes that have remained in the treaty.\u201d A hotbed of great-power competition? When leaders met last week in the Cook Islands for the annual meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum (Pif), the Treaty of Rarotonga was once again on everyone\u2019s lips.    The host of the summit, prime minister Mark Brown of the Cook Islands, argued the region \u201cshould rediscover and revisit our Rarotonga treaty to ensure that it reflects the concerns of Pacific countries today, and not just what occurred back in 1985\u201d. The treaty \u2013 signed on the 40th anniversary of the US atomic bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima \u2013 reflected \u201cthe deep concern of all forum members at the continuing nuclear arms race and the risk of nuclear war\u201d. Also known as the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, it designated a vast area from the west coast of Australia to Latin America where its parties must prevent the \u201cstationing\u201d (critics say this was always a deliberately ambiguous word) of nuclear weapons. \u201cThe treaty prohibits the use, testing or stationing of nuclear explosive devices in the South Pacific,\u201d the Cook Islands News explained on 7 August 1985. \u201cIt does not prohibit countries from transporting nuclear devices through the zone nor does it prohibit nuclear-powered or equipped ships from calling in ports within the area.\u201d Today the parties to this treaty are Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.    We regret that the Aukus agreement \u2026 is escalating geopolitical tensions in our region,  Pacific Elders\u2019 Voice     Once again, many of these nations are worried about the Pacific becoming a hotbed of great-power competition and the risk of that spiralling into conflict. Aukus feeds into some of those fears. \u201cWe regret that the Aukus agreement \u2026 is escalating geopolitical tensions in our region and undermining Pacific-led nuclear-free regionalism,\u201d says the Pacific Elders\u2019 Voice, a group of former leaders whose members include Anote Tong, the ex-president of Kiribati. The legality of a treaty \u2013 and the spirit of it Under the Aukus plan, Australia will buy at least three Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s, before Australian-built boats enter into service from the 2040s. In the meantime, the US and the UK will increase rotations of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, all aimed at deterring China from unilateral action against Taiwan or destabilising activities in the increasingly contested South China Sea. One point of sensitivity is that it will be the first time a provision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regime has been used to transfer naval nuclear propulsion technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. The Australian government has worked assiduously behind the scenes to reassure Pacific leaders on a key point about Aukus. \u201cCertainly when I was talking to people about it I would explain how it was consistent with the Treaty of Rarotonga,\u201d says the Australian minister for the Pacific, Pat Conroy. Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, concurs. The treaty, he notes, does not deal with nuclear-propelled submarines. \u201cMy view is that Aukus is consistent with Australia\u2019s Treaty of Rarotonga obligations,\u201d Rothwell says. \u201cPacific states may have concerns about the potential stationing of US and UK nuclear-armed warships in Australian ports under Aukus. The stationing of such vessels, as opposed to port visits, would be contrary to the treaty.\u201d    The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, sought to allay any Aukus-related concerns when he briefed Pacific leaders during the Pif meetings last week and appears to have held off any open rebellion. Albanese insists the treaty remains \u201ca good document\u201d and \u201call of the arrangements that we\u2019ve put in place have been consistent with that\u201d. But anti-nuclear campaigners point to the planned new aircraft parking apron at the Tindal base in the Northern Territory that will be able to accommodate up to six US B-52 bombers. The US refuses to confirm or deny whether the aircraft on rotation would be nuclear-armed, in line with longstanding policy. \u201cWe should delineate between a legalistic interpretation of the Treaty of Rarotonga and the spirit of it,\u201d says Marco de Jong, a Pacific historian based in Aotearoa New Zealand. \u201cPacific nations are growing increasingly frustrated at Australia\u2019s reliance on loopholes and technicalities.\u201d Australia: the regional outlier The Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons says a good way for Australia to reassure the region about its long-term intentions would be to sign the newer Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).   Related: Here be nodules: will deep-sea mineral riches divide the Pacific family?    This is an idea Albanese previously supported enthusiastically but which appears stalled. One potential problem is that the US has warned that the TPNW \u2013 which includes a blanket ban on helping others to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons \u2013 wouldn\u2019t allow for close allies like Australia to enjoy the protection of the American \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d. Documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information laws show the Australian defence department has warned the Labor government that the TPNW is \u201cinternationally divisive\u201d because the nuclear weapons states \u201care all opposed\u201d. But Mangioni, a member of the Youngsolwara Pacific movement of activists, counters that Pacific countries rushed to join the TPNW six years ago, reflecting their longstanding concerns about nuclear testing legacies. It\u2019s the same regional sentiment that spurred the earlier Treaty of Rarotonga. \u201cI would say that Australia is indeed the outlier compared to the rest of the Pacific states,\u201d Mangioni says. \u201cAustralia depends on nuclear deterrence as its policy but the rest of the Pacific states are nuclear abolitionists.\u201d", "Water testing after Menindee fish kill shows a \u2018chronically sick\u2019 river [2023-04-26T15:00:05Z]": "Water testing results from the Darling-Baaka River at Menindee indicate the river is \u201cchronically sick\u201d and raise concerns about the health of the Murray-Darling basin, experts say. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority released the second round of test results days after the state government declared it would investigate the deaths of millions of fish at Menindee in far-west NSW as a \u201cpollution incident\u201d.   Related: Menindee fish kill may have been partly caused by release of \u2018black\u2019 and clean water by authorities, researchers claim    The latest results were from seven samples collected by WaterNSW and the EPA on 30 March. Five were taken at Menindee and two downstream at Pooncarie. High levels of ammonia were detected in samples collected on 21 March, five days after the fish kill began. One detected ammonia at 56 times higher than the national guidelines for fresh and marine water quality. Dr Ian Wright, a professor of environmental science at Western Sydney University, said the first results showed a toxic level of ammonia and it was heartening to see that the levels had decreased. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 up to five times higher than it should be at some sites but it\u2019s nothing like the 56 times that it was before,\u201d he said.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Wright said nitrogen and phosphorus levels were still \u201csky high\u201d. The EPA said it suspected the high nutrient levels were due to the rotting fish. .  \u201cThe system is supercharged with nutrients,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a chronically sick river and it doesn\u2019t take much to tip over.\u201d That nutrient load led to algae blooms, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if a lot of these problems are manageable. The nutrients reflect everything that\u2019s going on, right up into Queensland, all over New South Wales. It\u2019s a massive catchment \u2026 all soil erosion, fertiliser, animal wastes, sewage.\u201d Blue-green algae was detected in both sets of samples. An amber alert remains in place for the river at Menindee and Pooncarie. This means people should not drink untreated water but there are no restrictions on recreational use such as swimming. Wright advised people against having contact with the water when an amber alert was in place. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a fish kill, there\u2019s likely to be bacteria, as in faecal bacteria,\u201d he said. In response to concerns raised by Wright about the first round of test results \u2013 which included not testing for certain bacteria \u2013 the EPA told Guardian Australia that more samples had been taken on 4 and 11 April and would be tested for bacteria. \u201cThe first round of testing on 21 March was to respond to the emergency and the immediate concerns around pesticides,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAdditional testing rounds will investigate other potential causes.\u201d The EPA also clarified the number of water samples taken, in response to criticism about a lack of samples. Six samples were collected on 21 March by WaterNSW, seven on 30 March by WaterNSW and EPA officers, five on 3 April by WaterNSW, two on 4 April by EPA officers, and six on 11 April by WaterNSW.

Chevalier College, based in the southern highlands, has announced a proposal that would see students in years 10 to 12 learn and work from home on Mondays, a move the principal says would \u201cset students up for success\u201d. The proposal would see students set work that would \u201cconsolidate learning\u201d from the week before and plan for the week ahead, with participating students needing to complete a \u201cmicro-credential course\u201d before being able to take part. \u2018Learning the modern way\u2019 The change has been praised by many of the pupils\u2019 parents, who took to social media to congratulate Chevalier College on rethinking the school week.

In this world we must all evolve, yet education is often stuck in the dark ages,\u201d she said. \u201cI have total faith in the school to do the right thing by my children. I have nothing but praise for the school and for Principal Miller and I am excited that my son can experience learning the modern way.\u201d The move is part of a broader program the school is introducing that they hope will actually increase face-to-face learning with teachers, where Mondays are for students to prepare by \u201cengaging in surface level tasks\u201d so there is more time for \u201cdeeper learning\u201d during the rest of the week. The changes include additional options for elective subjects, more collaborative projects, weekly \u201cembedded wellbeing time\u201d and space for greater student agency. The school\u2019s principal, Greg Miller, said the reforms were designed to help students develop a sense of independence through self-directed learning. \u201cThere is a focus on self regulation \u2026 and in particular [students\u2019] ability to manage their time and plan ahead, set goals, consolidate their learning \u2026 that\u2019s a lifelong learning capability that we want to enhance in our students,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about increased opportunities for autonomy, something that is demanded of our students once they graduate.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Students and parents were involved in developing the changes, Miller said, with a survey held earlier this year on what \u201ceducation could look like in 3-5 years\u201d. Multiple community forums were also held throughout the year, all focused on educating the school community on the new program. Parents have \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d supported the move, Miller said. \u201cWe have been inundated with messages of congratulations and encouragement to press forward. \u201cParents see that the world is changing, and they believe in an approach that will better prepare their children for a rapidly changing future.\u201d In a statement on their website, the school said only four families indicated they were leaving the college because of the changes.

But other regional bank closures will proceed as planned. It comes just a week after Westpac announced it would close a further 20 branches this year, including eight in regional Australia. On Wednesday, a spokesperson from Westpac said no decisions on the future of other branches would be made during the inquiry. The regional branches where closure is postponed are Denmark in WA, Gatton, Cloncurry, Ingham and Tully in Queensland, Robinvale and Sale in Victoria, and the Westpac-owned Bank SA branch in Kingston, South Australia. Among those still closing is the Westpac branch at Moree in north-west New South Wales, as well as the Coober Pedy and Tailem Bend branches.   Related: Rural financial counsellors brace for \u2018avalanche\u2019 of clients in mortgage stress    Moree Plains shire council mayor, Mark Johnson, said the community was not given the opportunity to have its say before the decision was made to close the bank that had operated in the area for almost 150 years.  \u201cThey came to us to talk about the closure, but there was nothing that we could say to even get them to reconsider, let alone change their mind,\u201d Johnson told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey just treated us with absolute contempt.\u201d In the last five years, Moree has endured drought and major flooding but things are finally looking up with the expansion of the inland rail which will pass through the shire, bringing much-needed economic investment and jobs.

I definitely know of people who are going to change banks if Westpac closes.\u201d The Senate inquiry into rural and regional bank closures was announced last week after the closure of 100 regional bank branches since September 2022. The first hearing is to be held in Sale, Victoria in March. According to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority there was a 23% decline in the number of regional bank branches, from 2,500 to 1,900, between June 2017 and June 2021.It matched the decline in bank branches in metropolitan and suburban areas, with the total number of branches in Australia dropping from 5,800 to 4,500 \u2013 a 23% decline \u2013 in the same period. According to the Regional Banking Taskforce, established by the Morrison government in October 2021 to assess the impact of bank closures, the branch closures were precipitated by a clear shift toward online banking. As of June 2022, the taskforce\u2019s final report found, around 80% of regional Australians used internet banking or mobile apps to pay bills. However, the Finance Sector Union national secretary, Julia Angrisano, said those figures were skewed because bank employees were \u201calmost required\u201d to sign customers up to online banking. \u201cSo every account you open, you also need to open that account so it\u2019s an online account,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd customers have done that, they do it to tick the box to satisfy the worker, because the workers says you have to do this. But they come back to the branch the very next week to get their banking done. \u201cIt\u2019s quite disingenuous for the bank to say, \u2018well we\u2019re doing it because customer trends have changed\u2019.\u201d While some people\u2019s banking habits have changed, Angrisano said, banking was still an essential service. Customers in regional areas were more likely to be older and may potentially lack the computer literacy to bank online, she said. \u201cEvery Australian, regardless of where they live, should be able to choose the way they want to interact with their bank,\u201d she said. In regional Australia, not having a bank branch in town can mean a 200km round trip to speak to an account manager. While Australia Post offers some banking services, getting approved for a mortgage or a loan or opening a new account often still requires a trip to the bank. Angrisano said she was concerned banks had not adequately considered the social and accessibility impacts of withdrawing branches from regional areas. The Australian Banking Association\u2019s protocol for bank closures in regional areas includes agreement to \u201cactively engage with customers and the community and formally respond to queries and concerns about the closure of the branch\u201d. However, Angrisano believes consultation has been lacking.  \u201cThey simply put a notice up on the door and send an email to customers,\u201d she said. The Senate inquiry will report by 1 December 2023.  This article was amended on 17 February 2023 to clarify that some regional Westpac branches will still be closed while the Senate inquiry takes place.

Lehrmann can now be named after his lawyers lost their judicial review of a Toowoomba magistrate\u2019s ruling that he should not be granted a non-publication order to maintain his anonymity. Lehrmann is charged with two counts of raping a woman in October 2021, with the case working its way through early committal proceedings at Toowoomba magistrates court since January. He has not yet been committed to stand trial. The former political staffer was thrown into the national spotlight in February 2021 after he was accused of raping another woman, former colleague and Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, at Parliament House in Canberra in 2019. He has always maintained his innocence, pleading not guilty at trial and later telling Seven Network\u2019s Spotlight program in June: \u201cIt simply didn\u2019t happen.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Until recently, Queensland law prevented him from named with respect to the Toowoomba allegations.   Related: High-profile man accused of Toowoomba rape loses court bid to maintain anonymity    However, the state introduced new laws in September to allow the naming of accused sex offenders after they are charged. Previously they could only be named after being committed to stand trial. The change brought the state into line with most other states and territories. Following the law change, Lehrmann\u2019s barrister, Andrew Hoare, sought a non-publication order on two grounds, arguing that revealing his client\u2019s identity could prejudice Toowoomba jurors against him and that the intense public scrutiny could deteriorate his mental health and increase the likelihood of his self-harm. However at a hearing on 13 October, magistrate Clare Kelly rejected both arguments, and this decision was upheld by the supreme court on Thursday. The judicial review and non-publication order were opposed by numerous media companies, including Guardian Australia, ABC, Nine, News Corp publications and Network Ten, as well as Queensland police. Mental health evidence \u2018difficult to accept\u2019 In reaching her earlier decision, Kelly acknowledged the defendant\u2019s \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d given \u201cthe events of the last couple of years\u201d, but noted he was not currently linked with a mental health professional nor was there any evidence he was being prescribed medication for his mental health. \u201cThat is a decision made by the defendant,\u201d she said. The magistrate found parts of the evidence submitted for the defendant by clinical psychologist Dr James Brown \u201cdifficult to accept\u201d.   Related: High-profile man accused of rape: prosecutors sifting through \u2018thousands of pages\u2019 of alleged victim\u2019s phone data    Kelly agreed instead with the argument of Rob Anderson, who represented the media companies, and said that the defence\u2019s portrayal of the defendant was \u201cincongruent\u201d with a man who had conducted a series of prime time, extended media interviews after he had been charged for the alleged Toowoomba rape. \u201cHe wants to be heard everywhere except here, it seems,\u201d Anderson told the court. He noted that the alleged rape victim wanted Lehrmann to be named. Kelly accepted that revealing the defendant\u2019s identity would result in intense media scrutiny but said that the principle of open justice in this case was \u201cvery much aligned with the public interest\u201d. She said \u201cembarrassing, damaging or even dangerous facts\u201d coming to light in an open court was a sacrifice that had to be made upon the altar of the public interest. \u201cOtherwise, powerful litigants may come to think that they can extract from courts or prosecuting authorities protection greater than that enjoyed by ordinary parties whose problems come before the courts and may be openly reported,\u201d she said. Kelly also dismissed the argument that naming Lehrmann could prejudice jurors against him, saying Toowoomba could not be considered a \u201crural or remote\u201d location \u2013 a criteria required for non-publication exemptions \u2013 and that the defendant was not a resident of the community. Revealing his identity in the regional Queensland city would be no different than it would in any other Australian city, she said. Judge backs magistrate\u2019s assessment At a judicial review heard on Thursday, Hoare tried to convince Justice Peter Applegarth that Kelly made an error by considering his client\u2019s failure to seek out a mental health plan or medication in assessing his risk of self harm. The barrister argued that the magistrate had not properly assessed the risk that his client faced, and lacked evidence to decide that his appearance in prime time media interviews was at odds with his portrayal in their psychologist\u2019s report. \u201cIt may be a seductive fact, but there\u2019s no proper basis to draw conclusion that a person\u2019s risk is static,\u201d Hoare said. \u201cThe risk is something which is fluid, it is very much determined by the circumstances in which a person finds themselves.\u201d But Applegarth responded by saying that the defence would have been better served by demonstrating the defendant\u2019s external presentation in those media interviews was at odds with his internal state of mental health \u2013 that his talk of lighting fires was \u201cbravado\u201d, that he was putting on a brave face but \u201cfelt rotten inside\u201d or that after giving the interviews he had fallen off an emotional cliff. \u201cNone of these things are said,\u201d Applegarth said. The judge concluded it was reasonable for a magistrate \u201cabsent that kind of explanation\u201d to \u201cplace less weight on Dr Brown\u2019s report\u201d. \u201cA cynic might say: \u2018I hope Channel 7 paid him, or his solicitors, a lot of money\u2019, for the consequences it had on his application, if nothing else,\u201d Applegarth said. In announcing his decision, the judge said that while the potential to be named \u201cweighed heavily\u201d on Lehrmann, this \u201cunfortunate effect on his mental health\u201d did not compel a finding that \u201ca non-publication order was necessary\u201d to protect his safety. \u201cThe supreme court concluded that, given the state of the evidence, it was open to a reasonable decision-maker to not be satisfied that the non-publication order was necessary to protect the safety of the applicant.\u201d The media\u2019s legal team and the police prosecutors will seek costs. Defamation action ongoing Lehrmann shot to prominence during the Higgins case, after she alleged she was raped in a parliamentary office in March 2019.   Related: Bruce Lehrmann defamation case: Network 10 lawyers seek to use evidence on rarity of false rape complaints    Having revealed the alleged events in media interviews in February 2021, Higgins subsequently made a complaint to police and Lehrmann was first named as the accused after being charged in August 2021. An initial criminal trial into Higgins\u2019 allegations was discontinued after juror misconduct. In December 2022, prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann. A subsequent inquiry into authorities\u2019 handling of the investigation, led by Walter Sofronoff, found \u201cseveral serious findings of misconduct\u201d against outgoing ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold SC. Drumgold has subsequently launched legal action against the findings. Lehrmann is also currently suing Network 10, journalist Lisa Wilkinson and the ABC over broadcasts he says defamed him by falsely alleging he raped Higgins. The defamation trial is expected to kick off in late November. Committal proceedings for the Toowoomba case began in January. His lawyer has requested the alleged victim provide 19 months of phone records, including six months of data before the date of the alleged offence. Prosecutors are now going through the phone data before deciding whether to agree to its release. The case is set to return to Toowoomba magistrates court on Wednesday 1 November. The Queensland government agreed to change its laws around the naming of accused sex offenders after accepting a recommendation last year from the women\u2019s safety and justice taskforce. The taskforce found there was no reason to treat those accused of sexual offences differently from those charged with other criminal offences, which allow alleged offenders to be named after they are charged. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).", "Morning Mail: toxic pollution at Antarctic base, victims\u2019 advocate calls for the cane, four French footballers to fear [2023-08-09T20:47:10Z]": "Good morning.

Too eager for the approval of others, too scared of being mocked, to own what we know to be true. It\u2019s time we freed ourselves from this prison we\u2019ve built around ourselves and finally admitted it: Nickelback are good. The idea that consuming media is for fun as opposed to signalling some unearned superiority over others is an idea that many people are still getting used to. But this is how most people have always approached their TV, their movies and their music \u2013 and it\u2019s why Nickelback, Creed, Lifehouse and every other 90s-era nu metal band featuring frontmen with soul patches making that \u201cmmyerrrrh\u201d sound are beginning to enjoy a critical revival. If you\u2019re anywhere from 25 to 50, your first reaction to reading that is probably something like \u201cugh\u201d. Since the internet\u2019s pre-YouTube days, Nickelback have been music\u2019s biggest punchline. Nickelback jokes and memes were a huge feature of those few precious years when Facebook, Twitter and Reddit were genuinely fun and interesting places to spend time online. In the cold and unforgiving light of 2024, the trope has aged like milk. Alongside \u201cwhy are the Kardashians famous\u201d, \u201cI like all music except rap and country\u201d and \u201csportsball\u201d, \u201cNickelback sucks\u201d has been conversational styrofoam for the last 15 years. It\u2019s so stale that the Queensland police service still wheels it out when its social media team is trying to be relatable.   Related: Women make the best pop stars \u2013 and it\u2019s about time the industry recognised it | Lauren O'Neill    Besides being a hangover from the era when irony and snark were the internet\u2019s currencies of choice, the Nickelback snobbery has always had a classist element to it. The Canadian four-piece have always worn their rural Albertan roots on their denim sleeves. For a long time, looking down one\u2019s nose at Nickelback was the lazy person\u2019s way of signalling that they had \u201cgood taste\u201d. But so-called \u201cbad taste\u201d media has a big advantage over the more highbrow stuff: it\u2019s a lot more fun. Covid reminded us that consuming movies, TV and music we actually enjoy is often more rewarding than diligently bingeing the latest critical darling to keep up with some imagined idea of cultural importance.  The soundtrack to the first season of Netflix smash Beef is filled with tunes from Incubus, Bush, Limp Bizkit and the gloriously named Hoobastank. Greta Gerwig and Ryan Gosling did the Lord\u2019s work by making Matchbox Twenty\u2019s 1996 hit Push the heart and soul of Barbie. For a band who became the face of bland car-commercial rock, Nickelback could hit you with some deeply affecting music. Never Again, the third single off their 2001 album Silver Side Up, is told from the perspective of a child whose father is violent and abusive. The Nickelback frontman, Chad Kroeger, based the song on his own childhood watching his mother\u2019s abuse at his father\u2019s hands; the original music video included statistics of domestic violence rates. Listening to it at the age of 10, it was the first piece of media I encountered that made me think about domestic violence as a concept. Photograph, the lead single from 2005\u2019s All the Right Reasons, also has a place in my heart despite being the internet\u2019s favourite punching bag for most of the late aughts. Their most autobiographical song, Photograph is an ode to growing up in a small town, moving away and never fully reconciling the desire to get out with the loneliness of leaving your roots. The photograph of the song\u2019s title, which became a meme in itself, is an artefact of Kroeger\u2019s upbringing; it shows a young Kroeger and childhood friend Joey Moi, who would later become the band\u2019s producer. For me, growing up in a midsized regional town about which I still have strong and conflicting feelings, a line like \u201cI miss it now/I can\u2019t believe it/So hard to stay/Too hard to leave it\u201d affects me more than I care to admit.

This comes as parliament prepares to debate a proposal to establish a new environmental protection authority, which would be responsible for compliance and enforcement. \nThe Jam Land case was controversial because Taylor sought meetings in 2017 with senior environment officials and the office of the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, about the laws that protected the grasslands \u2013 known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands \u2013 while the investigation was under way. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \n \nThe grasslands are one of the most endangered ecosystems in Australia and Jam Land was accused of spraying them with herbicide without approval under national environmental laws. \nTaylor held shares in Jam Land via his family company Gufee and his brother, Richard Taylor, was one of Jam Land\u2019s directors. \nAngus Taylor has repeatedly stated he \u201cdid not make any representations to federal or state authorities\u201d in relation to the investigation. \nIt took the department three and a half years to close the case, issuing Jam Land with a remediation order in 2020 to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on a different part of the property. The order was upheld by the federal court on appeal. \nDozens of documents shed light on tireless work by compliance officials from the federal environment department to try to reach an agreement with Jam Land throughout 2017. Simultaneously, other areas of the department were coming under political pressure about the listing of the grasslands, which protected the ecosystem under national laws. \nCorrespondence shows officials hoped to reach an agreement on an \u201coffset proposal\u201d to compensate for the clearing. But Jam Land felt this expectation was \u201conerous\u201d because an expert had assessed the planned weed control for compliance with separate state laws and the company was unaware of the federal listing. \nBut letters the compliance officials wrote to Jam Land stated the department\u2019s proposal was a lower threshold than the company would have been required to meet if it had sought approval and offset the clearing of the threatened habitat as required under national laws. \n \n  Related: Court upholds finding that company part-owned by Angus Taylor illegally cleared grasslands  \n \nDocuments show officials used the national offsets calculator \u2013 a numerical tool that weighs the effects of clearing threatened habitat against the benefits of a proposed offset to compensate for it \u2013 to help determine what remediation was required. \nIn an August 2017 letter to Richard Taylor, a compliance official wrote that the department had used \u201cparticularly generous\u201d numbers to arrive at a proposal that would require the company to preserve 103 hectares of grasslands on the property and 91 hectares of woodlands. This included woodlands not listed for protection under national laws. \n\u201cI note that the inputs into the offsets assessment guide are particularly generous, and would not normally be accepted in an assessment process,\u201d the official wrote. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cAs a result, the outcome of this assessment has arrived at a suitable offset that is of a value that is lower than would have been required, had the action been referred for approval. \n\u201cThis includes consideration of woodlands including woodlands not protected by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, as an offset for significant impacts to a critically endangered grassland ecological community.\u201d \nLater in 2017, the case appeared to stall until early 2019 when compliance officials contacted the company again, by which stage the National Farmers\u2019 Federation had become involved. \nDespite Jam Land\u2019s objections the proposal was onerous, compliance officials pushed on and the final remediation order issued in 2020 was for the restoration and protection of the 103 hectares of grasslands for a six-year period. \nThe director of the Biodiversity Council of Australia, James Trezise, said the detail and processes in the documents sent \u201ca very worrying signal\u201d. \n \n  Related: Department acts to stop release of documents on probe into land-clearing by company linked to Angus Taylor  \n \nIt was concerning, he said, for the department to require an outcome for a compliance action \u201cwhich seems less than what would have been required had someone gone through the formal assessment processes\u201d. \n\u201cIt undermines environmental outcomes and is also unfair to all the businesses who legitimately go through the proper assessment pathways to get approval,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIf we are to tackle Australia\u2019s extinction crisis and restore trust in our national nature laws, then there needs to be stronger penalties against breaching the law and an independent regulator to enforce them.\u201d \nChris McGrath, an environmental lawyer and regulation expert, said the material showed how difficult environmental regulation could be. \n\u201cThe department had to balance a whole range of factors,\u201d he said. \n\u201cPublic interest is generally the overarching consideration and that includes remediating the harm that was done and deterring similar conduct in the future.\u201d \nHe said the decision appeared a \u201creasonable outcome\u201d. \nThe Albanese government has been under pressure from the Greens, the Coalition and crossbenchers to introduce a promised broader package of legislation to overhaul Australia\u2019s broken nature laws. \nReforms have been delayed until after the next election but a bill to establish the regulator could be debated in the Senate as soon as this week. \nIn a bid to secure passage of the legislation, Anthony Albanese has said the government was considering watering down the proposal by abandoning a plan to allow the regulator to handle development proposal decisions \u2013 meaning an EPA would focus solely on compliance and enforcement. \n \n  Related: Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office asked if environmental rule changes could be kept secret  \n \nDr Megan Evans, an expert on environmental offsets and senior lecturer at the University of NSW in Canberra, said officials appeared to have worked hard to secure an environmental outcome \u201cwith the legal and policy tools available\u201d. \nShe said it was understandable the department sought an administrative response given the high costs of court action. \nEvans said, ultimately, Australia\u2019s nature laws did not \u201chave sufficient teeth to adequately respond to illegal clearing of threatened ecosystems\u201d. \n\u201cWhen it ends up being cheaper to illegally clear and provide an inadequate \u2018offset\u2019 as remediation rather than follow the law, it\u2019s a clear sign the law is broken and needs urgent reform,\u201d she said. \nAn environment department spokesperson said \u201chow the department works through a matter and applies outcomes is specific to the circumstances of each case\u201d. \n\u201cThe department continues to monitor the work done by Jam Land to ensure compliance with the remediation determination,\u201d they said. \nGuardian Australia has sought comment from Jam Land.", "Morning Mail: PM urged to mediate US-China peace, Dutton under pressure on tax, Israeli special forces raid hospital [2024-01-30T19:56:52Z]": "Morning, everyone.

The bureau\u2019s outlook for spring reveals that while an El Ni\u00f1o has not been formally declared, the climate will still be drier and hotter than usual.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cAfter what looks to be our warmest winter on record, spring is also likely to bring warmer days and reduced rainfall,\u201d said the bureau\u2019s senior climatologist, Lynette Bettio. \u201cMost of the country has a high chance of daytime temperatures that are warmer than usual, this spring. There\u2019s an increased chance of unusually warm days for almost all areas, especially in Western Australia and parts of the south east.\u201d Bettio said winter rainfall was about 8% below average with warmer temperatures reported everywhere apart from the south-east of Western Australia. The national mean temperature was about 1.5C higher than average. This spring will be very different to last year, according to Bettio, who said the 2022 season was \u201cthe second wettest on record\u201d. \u201cThe first rains of northern Australia\u2019s wet season are likely to be lighter than normal, especially for the Northern Territory and Queensland,\u201d she said.   Related: South-east Australia marine heatwave forecast to be literally off the scale    Last week, the Australasian Fire Authorities Council urged communities to prepare for what is likely to be the most significant bushfire season since the 2019-20 black summer fires. Large swathes of Australia are likely to experience an \u201cincreased risk\u201d of bushfires due to forecasts of above-average temperatures, decreased rainfall, high fuel loads and changing weather patterns. There is a chance of a higher number of bushfires occurring that require pre-emptive management and firefighting compared with the average. Areas at increased risk include regions in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Bettio said Australia\u2019s water storages were close to 80% full with many close to 90%. But she said some were now dropping below 50% and were likely to drop further. While the World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have already said an El Ni\u00f1o is in place, the bureau has remained at alert level. El Ni\u00f1o is characterised by high ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific that weaken the east to west trade winds that blow over the ocean. This climate pattern can drive droughts and heat in Australia, and can push up global temperatures. \u201cWe remain at El Ni\u00f1o alert as it is likely an El Ni\u00f1o will develop this year,\u201d Bettio said. \u201cSea surface temperatures are forecast to keep warming above El Ni\u00f1o levels.\u201d \u201cJuly was the warmest month on record globally when including land and ocean temperatures. We know that a warmer climate increases the risk of extreme weather like heat waves.\u201d", "Victorian government under fire from animal rights advocates over rejection of duck hunting ban [2024-01-29T06:16:11Z]": "Recreational duck shooting will remain legal in Victoria after the state government rejected a Labor-led parliamentary inquiry\u2019s call to ban the practice. The Allan government on Monday released its response to an inquiry that in August called for recreational duck hunting to be banned across all Victorian public and private land from 2024. The outdoor recreation minister, Steve Dimopoulos, said the government would not change its stance on duck hunting but would introduce changes from 2025 to make the practice safer and \u201cmore sustainable\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  This year\u2019s duck-hunting season will run for eight weeks, from 10 April. \u201cWe accept that hunting is a legitimate activity that many thousands of Victorians enjoy and we want to make it safe and responsible and sustainable,\u201d Dimopoulos said. \u201cThere are many things that I don\u2019t enjoy personally \u2013 duck hunting is one of them. But I can\u2019t sit here and tell Victorians how to live their lives.\u201d He stressed the government was accepting \u2013 partially or in full \u2013 seven of the inquiry\u2019s eight recommendations.   Related: Killing kangaroos could be banned in metro Melbourne in plan hailed as \u2018step in the right direction\u2019    \u201cThere was a diversity of views in the community and there was a diversity of views within the government,\u201d he said. From 2025, training and testing will be mandatory for hunters and the government will boost the resources of the Game Management Authority that regulates duck hunting. The premier, Jacinta Allan, and ministers met on Monday to thrash out a response.  The RSPCA Victoria chief executive, Liz Walker, said allowing duck and quail hunting to continue in the state would fly in the face of the inquiry\u2019s recommendations, the government\u2019s progress on animal welfare reforms, the clear evidence of its harms, and public sentiment. \u201cWe urge the government to hear the millions of Victorians who have made clear their support for a duck hunting ban in Victoria and to reverse this decision,\u201d Walker said in a statement. Recreational duck hunting has long been banned in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, but is still legal in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. On Monday, the opposition\u2019s spokesperson for agriculture, Emma Kealy, said the decision was \u201ccommon sense\u201d. \u201cAs we have said all along, duck harvesting is sustainable, safe and has huge economic benefits,\u201d Kealy said. The Sporting Shooters\u2019 Association of Australia also backed the decision.Its Victoria hunting development manager, David Laird, said some of the recommendations would be challenging for hunters. \u201cBut the only one that we cannot live with is a ban on hunting,\u201d he said. \u201cAlong with some hyped rhetoric, the inquiry did hear genuine concerns about sustainability and animal welfare. Those concerns are being addressed through key initiatives such as the adaptive harvest model and the waterfowl wounding reduction action plan.\u201d The Animal Justice party MP Georgie Purcell, who sat on the nine-member inquiry committee, told 3AW radio that she was \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d at thedecision. \u201cYou\u2019ve just gone through a parliamentary inquiry, instigated by the government themselves, which cost taxpayers time, money and resources, only for them to turn around and ignore it. It is completely gutless,\u201d she said. Purcell said she would no longer support the government by providing votes as a crossbencher in the upper house. \u201cNow they\u2019ll see the worst of me,\u201d she said. Danny Ryan from the Victorian Duck Hunters Association welcomed the decision.   Related: Animals to be recognised as sentient beings under proposed Victorian cruelty laws    \u201cGood government considers outcomes for all Victorians, not just a very small minority of animal activists,\u201d the former Field and Game Australia chairperson said. \u201cIt is expected that [the] government will adopt some aspects of the select committee recommendations and hunting groups and organisations are committed and ready to work with government to assess and implement those changes.\u201d Other recommendations of the inquiry\u2019s report included allowing traditional owners to continue hunting and retaining exemptions for farmers to control bird populations on agricultural land. The Labor MP and Yorta Yorta woman Sheena Watt wrote a minority report that broke ranks with the call for an outright recreational ban, instead suggesting tougher regulations and the involvement of Indigenous people in the management of game reserves. Despite there being no definitive evidence on wounding rates, the committee found thousands of birds were wounded each year and described it as an \u201cunacceptable animal welfare outcome\u201d.", "From sheep duffing to cattle rustling, how big a problem is livestock theft in Australia? | Gabrielle Chan [2023-05-02T02:50:15Z]": "Depending on your point of view, Waltzing Matilda should be either the national anthem or declared Australia\u2019s creepiest song. It is true that ballads about homeless people who steal sheep and then drown themselves while being chased by police are not usually the stuff of children\u2019s songs. But it\u2019s central theme, livestock theft, is a regular conversation among farmers. Otherwise known as \u201crustling\u201d or \u201cduffing\u201d, stealing farm animals is a crime with a long history.  The University of New England\u2019s Centre for Rural Criminology is preparing to carry out the first national farm crime survey in two decades, building on some individual state surveys.  Expected to begin later this month, it comes after some big robberies that made headlines \u2013 unusual in an industry with a history of underreporting.   Related: Thieves in Queensland ripping copper from tractors amid high prices, farmers say    In February this year, 700 sheep worth $140,000 were allegedly stolen from a farm west of Bendigo in Victoria. In March, a farmer west of Wagga Wagga in New South Wales reported 350 sheep were missing, the majority about to have lambs, making them even more valuable in a strong sheep market. The tendency of farmers not to report livestock theft means we do not have accurate figures, but the estimated losses are significant. NSW police data contained in a report by PwC shows that from 2016 to 2020 an average of 1,845 cattle a year were reported stolen in the state. The 2003 national farm crime survey showed only 35% of livestock theft was reported to police. Using this figure, PWC estimated total cattle theft at about 31,000 a year. The reasons that farmers don\u2019t report are simple. Given the average size of Australian farms, it\u2019s hard to have eyes on all four corners of the place. By the time you count stock, which could go missing in dribs and drabs, the theft might be discovered well after it happens. That means it could be a long time after the loot is turned into chops that are in somebody\u2019s freezer. So it is hard to find evidence. That means, in spite of some police efforts, there is a lack of confidence that the crime can be solved. Dr Kyle Mulrooney, co-director of the Centre for Rural Criminology, says stock theft is quite commonplace in Australia. About 40% of farmers have been the victims of stock theft and 80% have experienced general farm crime. That is in contrast with places such as the UK, where farm machinery theft is \u201cabsolutely massive\u201d, according to Mulrooney, and often directed by organised criminals. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to get to all those John Deeres [machinery] from the UK to eastern Europe overnight, so it\u2019s a whole different sort of geographical ballgame,\u201d he says. Mulrooney says anecdotal evidence in Australia suggests there are criminals taking economic opportunities in rural areas. Think of thieves stealing copper from farm machinery in Queensland in response to a spike in copper prices. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming into issues of food security, [things with] high levels of value for other markets, then you\u2019re going to see these types of players enter and steal these things,\u201d he says. You could imagine the odd sheep would be grabbed over a fence and stuffed in the boot. But when it comes to hundreds of sheep or cattle in one theft, a bit of specialised knowledge is required to muster quietly without causing suspicion from passersby. Mulrooney has heard stories of dogs\u2019 vocal cords being cut so they don\u2019t bark too loud. \u201cIf you\u2019re worth your salt and you can muster quick and you\u2019ve got good dogs, you\u2019re gonna get in and out of there in literally no time,\u201d he says. Thieves without farm experience are less slick. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a funny video of guys, clearly from the city, trying to back up a very large truck into a sale yard,\u201d Mulrooney said. \u201cThey try a couple of times, switch drivers, you can see them getting really frustrated.\u201d Research found most farmers take responsibility for their stolen goods, though it does not necessarily make them change their behaviour. Locking gates and removing keys might make it harder for would-be criminals, but for some it\u2019s not worth the inconvenience. \u201cEighty per cent of them say that they\u2019re responsible for preventing farm crime,\u201d Mulrooney says. \u201cWhich is interesting because you have people in the city and they say, no, the police should make me safe.\u201d And perhaps that is because there is a cultural acceptance that a certain level of farm crime will occur. Historically, stock were not just stolen to make a quick buck but also as an asset class during early white settlement to move up the societal ladder. \u201cThey would steal it for long-term economic and social capital,\u201d Mulrooney says. \u201cThat is, they steal cattle and go set up their own farm further out to the frontier.\u201d   Related: This is not Utopia: how will the inland rail project stand up to real-life scrutiny? | Gabrielle Chan    Modern solutions to old problems suggest there may be hope in technologies similar to facial recognition for sheep and cattle. One University of New England PhD student developed Stoktake, an AI-powered platform that identifies animals via their muzzle, which is as individual as a human fingerprint. There is also hope in GPS tracking ear tags to send messages back to the farmer that livestock are moving a lot more than normal or crossing paddock boundaries. Think \u201cfind my phone\u201d for livestock. But until those technological solutions combine more seamlessly, farmers are left with not many more options than the squatter in Banjo Patterson\u2019s poem.

The case did not appear to stop his stores from continuing to operate and sell illegal items. \nThe owner was back in court in March 2023, when the supreme court of New South Wales found there were \u201creasonable grounds\u201d for the NSW Crime Commission\u2019s suspicion that he had \u201cengaged in serious crime-related activity\u201d related to the same stores. \nThe judgment describes how earlier that month, the owner was found with $530,000 cash in his car in NSW. The NSW Crime Commission was granted an order seizing the cash, and funds in bank accounts linked to two of his vape stores. \nBetween 1 April 2022 and 30 September 2023, NSW Health seized more than 485,000 e-cigarettes and e-liquids worth an estimated street value of more than $15.5m. \nAsked why she thought stores were continuing to open and flourish despite incoming reforms, the NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told Guardian Australia in November that \u201cit clearly has some profitability\u201d. \nWhile she believes the state\u2019s enforcement efforts are having an impact, she acknowledges that the implementation of federal reforms in 2024 are sorely needed to make a real dent in the trade. \n\u201cSupply is so widespread \u2026 our compliance officers can only do a component of the work.\u201d \n \n  Related: Surge in NSW vape retailers as more than 600 stores join trade before federal crackdown  \n \nUnder the incoming reforms, therapeutic vapes to help with smoking cessation will remain available to patients, and these scripts can be filled through pharmacies. \nThese pharmacy-supplied products will need to meet stronger quality standards, will come in limited flavours, will be in pharmaceutical packaging, and any importers will need to hold licences and permits from the Office of Drug Control. \nRichard Lee is the CEO of Liber Pharmaceuticals, which supplies retail pharmacy networks with nicotine vaping products, and he believes the government\u2019s reforms will dent the illicit trade. \n\u201cWith limited enforcement powers to date, the huge margins available from the illicit sale of disposable vapes have seen a black market explode with little fear of punishment and nominal fines to the few who have been prosecuted,\u201d Lee says. \n\u201cAs such, we witnessed, quite literally, hundreds of vape stores popping up, in a cookie-cutter fashion, in both metro and rural areas. These stores followed the same business model, carried substantially the same stock, and all in flagrant disregard of the law.\u201d \nThe recent spate of tobacconists set on fire in Victoria and Queensland has demonstrated how organised crime has \u201cnow embedded itself in the illicit vaping supply chain, alongside illegal tobacco\u201d, he says. \n\u201cThe government\u2019s enforcement announcements are timely \u2026 and seeks to break the illicit supply chains that have become embedded on Australia\u2019s high streets in recent times,\u201d he says. \nThe CEO of the Master Grocers Association, David Inall, whose organisation represents independent retailers, says the MGA \u201cwill ensure that the new laws are well-understood as all retailers must comply\u201d. \n\u201cAny non-compliance should be dealt with by the relevant law enforcement authorities,\u201d he says. \nThe CEO of the Public Health Association of Australia, Adj Prof Terry Slevin, has \u201cno sympathy\u201d for the thousands of small retailers who will have to close their stores or cull their vape stock once the reforms come in. \nHe says many of the stores have been getting around current restrictions by selling \u201cnon-nicotine\u201d vapes that actually contain significant quantities of the addictive substance, and also knowingly sell them to children. \n \n  Related: The tobacco industry claims smoking reforms fuel the black market. Health experts say this is wrong  \n \nSlevin believes the tobacco and vaping industries are subsidising some of the retailers, \u201cin the hope of creating pressure on government, on the basis that the more stores that are selling the products and relying on them for the viability of their business, the more they can argue these reforms will be anti small business\u201d. \n\u201cI think many of these stores are part of a political strategy. They also wouldn\u2019t open unless they had some kind of assurance from suppliers that these products will be popular and profitable. But I have no sympathy for any business taking advice from the tobacco or vaping industries.\u201d \nHe says if these businesses are forced to close due to their profit being contingent on vape sales, then \u201cthat\u2019s just the price they have to pay\u201d. \n\u201cA good business operator will understand risk and manage that risk, and these reforms have been on the table pretty much since this government came into effect,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re opening a vape store in 2023 expecting to profit for years to come from the sale of vapes, despite these clear government reforms, then that\u2019s a bet I hope you lose.\u201d \n \n Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com \n", "Gina Rinehart says renewable energy could use one-third of Australia\u2019s prime agricultural land. Is she right? [2023-12-21T14:00:28Z]": "Wind and solar farms are popping up in renewable energy zones and designated development areas around Australia. Within those zones, it can feel as though new projects are everywhere: on your property or your neighbour\u2019s, on the hills into town. Fuelling this narrative is Australia\u2019s richest person, Gina Rinehart, who said at an event naming her as the Australian Financial Review\u2019s 2024 business person of the year that one-third of Australia\u2019s \u201cprime agricultural land\u201d could be \u201ctaken over\u201d by renewable energy projects, particularly solar. That figure comes from a report released this month by the Institute of Public Affairs. The report by the rightwing thinktank, which has consistently advocated against emissions reductions policies and called for Australia to pull out of the Paris agreement, claims that one-third of Australia\u2019s agricultural land would \u201chave to be sacrificed\u201d to renewable energy developments to meet Australia\u2019s energy needs with a 50:50 mix of wind and solar by 2050. According to the Australia Institute, the Clean Energy Council and projections by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), both the IPA\u2019s prediction on the amount of area required and the demand assumptions it is based on are incorrect.   Related: Windfarm plans in choppy waters as Coalition and One Nation whip up doubts     \u201cI can\u2019t overstate how ridiculous the extrapolations in this report are,\u201d says Australia Insitute principal adviser Mark Ogge. The energy demand claim The report forecasts that energy demand in Australia will grow to 15,459 terawatt hours by 2050 \u2013 more than 30 times the projections by Aemo and the Net Zero Australia report of 420TWh and 450TWh respectively. Nicholas Aberle, director of energy generation and storage at the Clean Energy Council, says basing energy demand calculations not on actual demand but on the potential energy value of fossil fuel resources has \u201cfabricated a scenario which forecasts more than 30 times the energy requirements detailed in expert analysis by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Net Zero Australia report\u201d. The analysis contained in the IPA\u2019s report also \u201cignores critical facts that do not support a pre-determined view of Australia\u2019s clean energy transformation\u201d, Aberle says. Dr Kevin You, the author of the IPA\u2019s report and a senior research fellow at the institute, rejected criticism of his analysis, describing it as \u201cweasel words from the climate lobby\u201d that are \u201cdesperate and have no credibility\u201d. He argued critics of the analysis had grossly misrepresented the report. A spokesperson for Rinehart confirmed her comments were in reference to information published by the IPA, and said they related to the loss of prime agricultural land \u2013 not agricultural land as a whole. They said the IPA was \u201crenowned over many years for their meticulous research\u201d. The IPA report does not refer to \u201cprime agricultural land\u201d, but a press release that accompanied its release did so.    The IPA analysis is based on the assumption that renewable energy will have to \u201cproportionally replace all the energy attributable to Australia\u2019s hydrocarbon fuel production as of today, including for export purposes\u201d.  Ogge says the report is based on primary energy \u2013 all the energy used in the current processes of power generation \u2013 not energy demand or even the current delivered energy output of coal-fired power stations. He says that results in a \u201c200% exaggeration of demand figures\u201d. \u201cWith fossil fuels, most of the energy is lost as heat \u2013 in coal-fired power stations, 60% is lost as heat,\u201d Ogge says. \u201cThey are saying that renewables have to generate enough energy to cover the heat lost by fossil fuels. It\u2019s a crazy assumption.\u201d The land claim After making these assumptions about energy demand, the report sets out to calculate \u201chow much land will be required if energy from wind and solar were to replace all the energy contained in the hydrocarbon fuels (coal, gas, and oil) produced in Australia each year\u201d. The figure it arrives at is between 57m and 181m hectares by 2050. According to the Clean Energy Council, replacing all Australia\u2019s coal-fired power stations with solar farms would take less than 0.016% of the country\u2019s land area, equivalent to 0.027% of agricultural land, on a calculation of two hectares per 1MWdc of installed solar capacity. But it notes it is \u201cunlikely\u201d that the 50GW of renewable energy needed to replace retiring coal-fired power station would be generated by solar farms alone. It says this impact can be further minimised by pursuing solar projects that can be integrated with agricultural production. In New South Wales, where concentrated development in renewable energy zones has caused angst in some local communities, a 2022 report by the NSW agriculture commissioner says it \u201cit seems unlikely\u201d that the total area of rural land to be converted to renewable energy production would exceed 80,000ha and is \u201cmore likely\u201d to be about 55,000ha. That\u2019s 0.1% of rural land in NSW. However, the commissioner notes there will be \u201cmany small local effects \u2026 and it is important these local impacts be minimised\u201d. The IPA\u2019s report also does not include rooftop solar \u2013 which in the first quarter of 2023 was the single biggest contributor of renewable energy to the National Electricity Market \u2013 nor does it include offshore wind, hydro or other electricity generation sources. It also does not account for greater efficiency in energy use due to electrification. According to Aemo, one-third of all detached homes in the national grid \u2013 most of which are in cities \u2013 have rooftop solar panels. By 2050 rooftop solar is expected to account for 72GW of Australia\u2019s energy production, compared with 70GW from utility-scale wind and 55GW from solar farms. What about shared land use? The suggestions around loss of agricultural land assume that all renewable energy would be built on agricultural land and do not account for mixed use under solar and windfarms.  About 97% of land under onshore windfarms is either grazed or cropped, says Karin Stark from Farm Renewables Consulting, and there is growing work on using the land under solar farms.   Related: Australia urgently needs a grid upgrade \u2013 but the march of new power lines faces a bush revolt    \u201cYou can\u2019t really include the area that a windfarm covers as being taken out of farming,\u201d she says. Stark co-authored a report released last month called Pursuing an Agrivoltaic Future in Australia about the opportunities associated with integrating solar developments and agriculture, and the policy settings required to help it along. Grazing sheep under solar panels is already a common practice and has the dual benefit of keeping grass low to reduce the fire risk as well as providing shade and protection from predators for sheep, resulting in increased soil moisture, increased grazing time and a reduction in lamb loss.    But Stark says most of these arrangements have been put in place after the solar farms were developed and that considering agricultural co-design earlier in the design process would allow for more productive shared use. There are examples in the US and Europe of co-locating solar panels and horticultural crops, particularly berries and leafy greens. \u201cFarming can actually benefit from having solar on the land because of the increased soil moisture, reduced irrigation demands and partial shade, which is becoming more and more important in Australia as the climate warms,\u201d Stark says. Hosting a renewable energy project also allows farmers to diversify their income and increases resilience through unproductive years. Stark, who lives on a farm in the central west Orana renewable energy zone in regional NSW, says she understands the rush of development can feel overwhelming for farmers living in renewable energy zones, and the rollout has not always been handled well. \u201cIt can feel like it\u2019s all around you,\u201d she says. \u201cFarmers aren\u2019t really being supported in this transition to understand their rights.\u201d That makes it even more important to counter misinformation, she says. \u201cIt is a big deal for regional communities if they see productive land being taken out of supply for energy production,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very ideological, so trying to put facts around it doesn\u2019t always convince people.

Midwives have warned of staff shortages in New South Wales, with Auburn, Wollongong and Coffs Harbour hospitals struggling to fill vacancies. They say there is a \u201csignificant\u201d shortage in Western Australia, leading to potentially unsafe environments. In South Australia, the town of Gawler had \u201cno room at the inn\u201d at Christmas, with the birthing unit shut due to staff shortages. There are similar stories in Tasmania. The shortages are patchy across the nation and hard to quantify because of the mix of private and public services run by the different states and territories, but experts overwhelmingly agree the crisis is disproportionately affecting rural and regional Australia. Christine Catling is an associate professor in midwifery at the University of Technology Sydney and a research fellow of the National Health and Medical Research Council. She says maternity services are \u201cin the middle of a massive crisis\u201d after years of experiencing an ageing workforce, where early-degree midwives are \u201cground down\u201d by a system that doesn\u2019t allow them to deliver continuity of care.

The ideal model, she says, is where a midwife can see the mother through postnatal care and talk to her about how she mothers, breastfeeding, pelvic floor health and birth trauma. \u201cThe biggest worry, when I think of the overall picture, is that women aren\u2019t getting access to the best model of care,\u201d she says. Health department modelling from 2019 \u2013 before the pandemic \u2013 showed Australia would have enough midwives through to 2030 but that there would be a \u201cmaldistribution\u201d, leaving vacancies in rural and regional areas.    The pandemic also caused a population shift, with people flooding into towns that were not prepared. And births are getting more complicated with the age of mothers rising and chronic diseases more common. It is not just midwives. Obstetricians are also in short supply in many places. Dr Benjamin Bopp, the president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, says GP obstetricians (who are not specialists but can perform emergency caesareans and deal with other emergencies) form the \u201cbackbone\u201d of many rural, regional and remote maternity services.

Experts such as Mogharbel, a manager at the 1800 My Options program that provides free advice about reproductive health services, have said access to abortion in Victoria largely depends on where a woman lives. Surgical procedures were mostly available in urban areas, meaning those from the outer suburbs and regions faced increased costs to cover travel, accommodation and time off work.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWe hear from people every day who have to travel often several hours to be able to access what is standard reproductive health care,\u201d Mogharbel said. On Wednesday the state\u2019s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, will announce that three more hospitals \u2013 based in Melbourne\u2019s eastern and western suburbs, and in the Mornington Peninsula \u2013 would offer surgical abortions. Eastern Health has begun offering surgical termination services, with Peninsula Health and Western Health to follow in the coming months. Combined, the three health providers service almost two million Victorians.   Related: Victorian Liberals have \u2018no plans\u2019 to change abortion laws despite MP\u2019s claims, leader says    The announcement comes as this month the government marks 15 years since the decriminalisation of abortion and eight years since the introduction of safe access zones around clinics. Under the reforms, Victorian women can access abortions up to 24 weeks. Beyond 24 weeks, a medical practitioner can provide an abortion if another medical practitioner agrees that it is appropriate. Thomas said this latest step would mean fewer women would have to travel to the city for safe and accessible abortion services. \u201cUndertaking any medical procedure can be a stressful experience, and with improved access across Melbourne, more women will be able to access this critical healthcare option at their local hospital \u2013 ensuring they are closer to the support of friends and family, while also reducing the cost and time of travel,\u201d she said. Mogharbel welcomed the announcement. \u201cIf there\u2019s now a service in Frankston, that will mean \u2013 for someone living further down the peninsula \u2013 that will be a one-hour journey rather than two hours, which will bring down the cost of travel, as well as knock-on costs such as childcare and accommodation,\u201d Mogharbel said. She said public hospitals were one of the only health services that either fully bulk-billed surgical abortions or charged lower fees, with most services provided by GPs, private clinics and specialists costing between $600 and $900. This is in addition to the cost of a GP visit for a referral and other tests that are required before a termination.   Related: The public Catholic hospitals refusing abortion access \u2013 podcast    \u201cAbout 30% to 40% of our callers can\u2019t afford the sexual and reproductive health that they\u2019re looking for, so the only option is going to be a public hospital, or one of the state government hubs,\u201d Mogharbel said. \u201cThat\u2019s why announcements like these are so important.\u201d Mogharbel said 1800 My Options receives about 600 calls each month, with 85% relating to terminations. Based on calls to the hotline, some of the greatest demand was from the growing outer metropolitan areas in Hume, Melton, Whittlesea and Wyndham, which she said will benefit from the services being offered at Western Health. Thomas said Victoria had the most \u201cprogressive laws in the nation and a network of metropolitan, regional and rural health services\u201d providing terminations. She said further work was also under way to improve access to women\u2019s healthcare services, including adding to the state\u2019s 11 sexual and reproductive health hubs and establishing 20 new comprehensive women\u2019s health clinics.", "\u2018It\u2019s honest beauty\u2019: the net-zero homes paving the way for the future [2024-05-25T20:00:34Z]": "\u201cEnergy efficient\u201d, \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d and \u201cnet zero\u201d are buzzwords we hear more and more as we face the impact of climate change. But do we think about them enough in building? \nGlobally, a move towards sustainable housing is growing. In Europe, efforts to move to greener homes hope to combat rising energy costs and be better for the planet. But 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions still come from the real estate sector. \nIn Australia, off-grid electric homes are becoming more common. A recent report by the University of New South Wales is pushing the built environment industry to reach net zero by 2040, and according to a 2024 study by Domain, energy-efficient real estate is attracting more interest than conventional homes. \nBut even if net zero housing \u2013 which means your home releases no net carbon \u2013 is not yet the norm, many architects are beginning to champion sustainable design, aiming for high energy ratings and future-proofing homes to adapt with the changing climate. \nBy reducing their carbon footprint, and using passive design \u2013 which focuses on conditions like sunlight and layout instead of artificial climate control \u2013 these net zero homes make it clear that going back to basics is key to making the switch. \nHuff\u2019n\u2019Puff Haus, Strathbogie ranges, Victoria \nOnce upon a time a big bad wolf could huff, puff, and blow the straw house down. But not any more \u2013 in rural Victoria, Envirotecture\u2019s Huff\u2019n\u2019Puff Haus is here to stay. \nAsked to create an off-grid, all-electric, energy-efficient home, architect and director Talina Edwards set out to build a house that would let two empty nesters age in place for years to come. \nHuff\u2019n\u2019Puff house is made from prefabricated, structurally insulated straw bale panels about 300-350mm thick and has \u201cpassivhaus premium certification\u201d, which means it generates more renewable energy than it uses. \nAs a waste product, straw not only sequesters CO2 \u2013 reducing the embodied carbon of the project \u2013 but is an under-utilised material in building. Edwards says the amount of straw burned in paddocks annually would be enough to insulate 40,000 homes in Australia every year. \nEnvirotecture also aimed to use sustainably sourced timber, reduce use of plastic during building and focused on good ventilation strategy for healthy air quality. The house needs hardly any heating and cooling, instead relying on orientation, cross ventilation, passive shading and natural light. \n\u201cThe cost of building anything is expensive, but not the cost of building well,\u201d says Edwards. \n\u201cIf you reduce the size and maybe you don\u2019t have so many built-in pieces of joinery \u2026 you can choose how to prioritise.\u201d \nDespite Australia\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with large homes, the 200 sq metre house is flexible and functional \u2013 a corridor opens out into spaces instead of whole rooms. A breakfast bar can become a study space; a window seat, a place to look at the view. \n\u201cOn a regional site it always looks a bit odd if you\u2019ve just got this tiny little house, but we did keep it a modest size,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cI think that\u2019s the first tip for anyone building no matter where.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe project has won many awards since its completion and is shortlisted in the sustainability category in the House awards. But for Edwards, it is not about accolades. \n\u201cEveryone kept saying, it\u2019s so beautiful \u2026 but it\u2019s not about what it looks like,\u201d she says. \n\u201c\u2026 The beauty of it is beyond skin deep. What\u2019s hidden behind? What\u2019s the true heart of what this is doing?\u2026 It\u2019s honest beauty, not just considering the aesthetics.\u201d \n39S House, Brisbane, Queensland \nOn a 240 sq metre block in Brisbane, architect Andrew Noonan has breathed new life into a dilapidated Victorian-era timber cottage, giving the five bedroom family home a net zero future. \nAiming for a \u201cwhole-of-life net zero\u201d home \u2013 one that takes as much carbon out of the system through energy production and materials as it takes to build \u2013 Noonan went back to basics, applying passive-design principles to literally turn the house around. \n\u201cThe house originally ran north-south. It had a very long west-facing facade,\u201d says Noonan. \n\u201c100m away there is Suncorp stadium \u2026 and a main road, so quite noisy on that same western side \u2026 it became quite an opportunity to do one big move to solve a couple of problems.\u201d \nNoonan removed a 1930s extension at the rear of the home and added a new extension to achieve east-west orientation. It\u2019s a five bedroom home, with four of them occupied, but Noonan says necessity must be questioned when building. \n\u201cDo we all need media rooms? Do we all need three, four or five bathrooms?\u201d he says, adding that key to the net zero approach is letting the climate dictate material choice to ensure a lifespan beyond the 55-year average for a home. \nIf you have high-quality doors and windows \u201cthey\u2019ll very much last beyond the life of the building,\u201d Noonan says. \n\u201cIf they\u2019re made in a way that\u2019s designed to be thermally efficient \u2013 not cheap, single piece aluminium frames with very thin glazing in them \u2026 but something that is thinking about performance \u2013 that will have an ongoing value.\u201d \n39S House also has no heating or cooling, instead relying on heavily insulated timber framing and orientation to cater to Brisbane\u2019s humidity. \nAnd while Noonan recommends electrifying everything by switching to induction appliances, air source heat pumps and getting photovoltaic panels\u2013 which are slightly different to solar \u2013 he says gadgets \u201cwon\u2019t solve the problem if it\u2019s not worked out in a more simple way first\u201d. \nGreen space occupies 50% of the site, reducing external heat. The air temperature directly outside the doors and windows is 15 degrees cooler than it would be if the area was paved with no trees. \nAnd the home also considers Brisbane\u2019s propensity to flood, lifting the house above ground and aiming to absorb flood waters into the soil, slowing the run-off rate downstream. \n\u201cJust because it\u2019s doing some really interesting sustainability things doesn\u2019t mean it has to look like a tree house,\u201d says Noonan. \n\u201cIt can look like it can look like any house \u2026 the aesthetic doesn\u2019t really tie into the performance.\u201d \nFarrier Lane House, Perth, Western Australia \nArchitect Matt Delroy-Carr set out to build an affordable, high performing family home. But when a lifecycle assessment partway through the project came back carbon neutral, he added net zero status to the list. \nHis home, Farrier Lane House, now acts as a demonstration project on how to build sustainably for his practice MDC Architects. \n\u201cA 180 sq metre-house might have exactly the same things in it as an 140 sq metre-house like mine,\u201d says Delroy-Carr. \u201cIt\u2019s just got 40 sq metres of wasted area that\u2019s inefficiently designed.\u201d \nFarrier Lane House has large windows to open up the space. Its house-to-garden ratio heavily favours green space, filling 60% of the site to extend the liveability of a smaller-footprint home. \nInside, it has a double brick ground floor, providing a solid thermal mass, a hybrid upper floor with reverse brick veneer and timber-framed floors throughout. \nBut Delroy-Carr says often the more you focus on carbon neutrality through material use, the harder it is to get a high NatHERS star rating. \n\u201cThe rating system heavily favours masonry construction \u2026 it loves brick and concrete, because they\u2019re high thermal mass materials,\u201d he says. \n\u201cThe more concrete and bricks you put into the project, the higher the star rating, but inevitably, the higher the carbon footprint.\u201d \nWhile we are creatures of habit, Delroy-Carr says younger generations are beginning to focus more on sustainability and smaller footprint. But his advice to clients is \u201cdon\u2019t try to do everything.\u201d \nFor him, the first thing to try is orientation. Even with MDC\u2019s off the plan homes, all are intended to face north. \nAmong three things \u2013 carbon footprint, thermal performance and liveability \u2013 coexisting, responding to your climate is paramount and something you can do on a modest budget. \n\u201cThat\u2019s our basic design philosophy \u2026 you don\u2019t need to up-spec a house with too many add-ons to make it comfortable.\u201d", "Why are some Victorian hospitals saying they\u2019re freezing recruitment and looking for ways to cut costs? [2024-06-27T07:03:10Z]": "There are fears among Victorian hospitals that they will have to close beds, delay elective surgeries and sack staff as the state government works to rein in post-pandemic health spending amid its debt woes. Despite both the premier, Jacinta Allan, and the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, dismissing such measures as \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201cfearmongering\u201d, several major hospitals have confirmed they have imposed hiring freezes ahead of submitting their annual budgets to the health department.   Related: Only one in four Victorian public hospitals to report restraints on patients under new reforms    The opposition leader, John Pesutto, has described the situation as \u201calarming\u201d and warned \u201clives will be put at risk\u201d. But what\u2019s actually going on? Here\u2019s what we know.  What is happening at Victorian hospitals?    On Wednesday, Western Health \u2013 which operates five hospitals across Melbourne\u2019s west \u2013 was the first health service to announce it had imposed a temporary hiring freeze and was preventing travel. A spokesperson said it was working with the Department of Health to agree on a final budget, and that the interim measures were \u201caimed at having minimal impact in providing best quality treatment, care, research and education\u201d. Meanwhile, in an email to staff, Northern Health \u2013 which runs the Northern hospital at Epping and three other hospitals \u2013 said they had also introduced a \u201ctemporary freeze\u201d on recruitment and recognised the feelings of \u201cuncertainty and stress\u201d. \u201cThis decision is necessary as we strive to reduce our operating deficit for 2024-25,\u201d the email, seen by Guardian Australia, said. Will others follow?   The Herald Sun on Thursday reported others were considering similar moves. It said Monash Health, which runs Monash Medical Centre and Monash Children\u2019s hospital, among others, was looking at shutting beds and cancelling all weekend elective surgeries. This was not confirmed by Monash Health. In a statement to Guardian Australia, it said: \u201cMonash Health\u2019s annual budget is currently being developed in close consultation with the Department of Health to deliver the care our community needs.\u201d The Herald Sun has also reported the Alfred and the Royal Children\u2019s hospital could also be affected by budget pressures. Has the government cut hospital budgets?   The Victorian Healthcare Association says there have been several \u201ccost containment measures\u201d tightening the squeeze on hospitals. This began at the end of 2023, when the department asked hospitals to revise their budgets and find savings across non-clinical staff and services. In March, small rural health services were asked to do the same. In May\u2019s budget, the government announced $8.8bn in funding to \u201ckickstart a change in the way our hospitals are funded, so they can more effectively and efficiently deliver world-class care \u2013 and plan for the future\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Some of this funding was \u201ctop-ups\u201d paid by the government to cover deficits recorded by more than half the state\u2019s public hospitals. That same week, Thomas wrote to hospitals to inform them no further funding would be provided beyond what was committed in the budget, and urged them to take measures to reduce deficits. Allan said on Thursday that it was \u201cstandard practice\u201d for hospitals to \u201cplan for the year ahead\u201d. She said there was no confirmation of recruitment freezes because hospitals were yet to submit their draft budgets, due at the end of the week, to the health department. \u201cFor emails to be sent out saying certain things that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of days, that does not reflect where discussions are between hospitals and the department,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cAny speculation is just that \u2013 speculation and scaremongering, particularly by Liberal politicians.\u201d   Related: Victoria\u2019s pill testing service to become permanent after 18-month trial    Thomas told ABC Radio Melbourne that her \u201cclear message to health services\u201d was that there should be \u201cno impact to patient care\u201d. She said she had asked hospitals to cut \u201cwaste and duplication\u201d, including in executive, and communication and marketing departments. \u201cThere are no directions to hospitals to cut or close any care,\u201d she said.  What else is the government doing with the state\u2019s health system?  In September last year, an expert advisory committee was set up to see if some of the state\u2019s health services could merge.

The 58-year-old spent much of his time online, uploading YouTube videos about the extreme Christian ideology known as \u201cpremillennialism\u201d. The videos on his now-deleted channel, which he launched in 2018, mostly only attracted a few hundred views. But the fringe end-of-days religious messages, recorded from a rural town in Arizona, resonated with Gareth and Stacey Train in the Queensland township of Wieambilla. Day, 58, was arrested last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in Tucson, Arizona on two counts of making interstate threats. One of those related to comments posted online in December 2022 allegedly inciting violence in connection with the incident at Wieambilla, in which two police officers and a neighbour were shot dead.   Related: Wieambilla shootings: FBI arrests US man in connection with Queensland terrorist attack that left six dead    \u201cFrom January 2022 to February 2023, Day used social media platforms to express a desire to incite violence and threaten a variety of groups and individuals, including law enforcement and government authorities,\u201d the US Attorney\u2019s Office, district of Arizona, alleged in a statement. \u201cFollowing the killing of two Queensland Police Service officers in December 2022, Day posted a video on YouTube threatening any law enforcement official who came to his residence. \u201cSeparately \u2026 [it is alleged] Day threatened to kill [World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus] in February 2023 on the video platform BitChute, calling on others to join him.\u201d After Day\u2019s arrest, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents searched his remote property, 30km north of Heber-Overgaard in northern Arizona. In YouTube comments seen by Guardian Australia, Day referred to the Wieambilla shooters, Gareth and Stacey Train, as his \u201cbrother\u201d and \u201csister\u201d. Stacey echoed the warmth between them. \u201cDon \u2026 if we could visit in person, the tea and coffee would be strong and the bread would be rich and hearty \u2013 just like the conversation,\u201d Stacey told Day. Gareth Train began following Day\u2019s YouTube channel in May 2020. Twelve months later Day began exchanging messages with the couple before they accessed another older account he had created in 2014. In a final video shared by the Trains last year, Stacey told \u201cDon\u201d they would \u201cbe home soon\u201d and that they loved him. The chilling video was filmed after the couple, along with Gareth\u2019s brother, Nathaniel Train, had ambushed police officers with a hail of bullets. Constables Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold were killed after they had attended the property to perform a welfare check on Nathaniel. A neighbour, Alan Dare, was also killed after coming to investigate a fire that had broken out. Later that evening the Trains were shot dead by police at their rural Wieambilla property. It wasn\u2019t long until the Trains\u2019 final message was uncovered by the media and questions were raised about the identity of \u201cDon\u201d. Days after the Wieambilla attack, Day uploaded two now-deleted YouTube videos about the shootings. In the first he spoke about the couple being \u201con the run\u201d. \u201cThe devils came for them to kill them, and they had to kill the devils themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cMy only brother [Gareth Train] that I can find in the last 15, 20 years is in another part of the world and I have no one here.\u201d In another now-deleted video, titled \u201cbrother sister martyr\u201d, Day said the couple did exactly what their \u201cheavenly father would have done in the same situation\u201d. Guardian Australia revealed last year that days before the shootout the Trains had also discussed buying \u201csupplies\u201d with Day. \u201cWe are happy and keen for the next stage of the journey,\u201d the Trains wrote. \u201cSo it begins.\u201d The US Attorney\u2019s Office says Day faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and up to three years of supervised release on each of the two counts. On Wednesday Guardian Australia uncovered an active social media account which appears to belong to Day. In a comment posted a week ago, the account voices opposition to the proposed construction of windmills in Heber-Overgaard. It also references a conspiracy theory about a \u201cUN agenda 2030\u201d which it says are \u201cdesigned to displace off-gridders\u201d\u2019. \u201cThey will succeed, one way or another ... whether through our consent or the barrel of a gun,\u201d the account writes. \u201cIt will take grit and sacrifice to stop the monsters from erecting any more of those damned things; we either go Geronimo on them, or lose all that we have.\u201d   Related: Wieambilla shootings: questions remain on monitoring of domestic extremists    Conspiracy theorist rhetoric was uncovered on Day\u2019s YouTube channel last year.

NAB is the only one of Australia\u2019s big four banks not to pause the closure of regional banks while the inquiry is under way. For example, the Commonwealth Bank has announced it will not close any more regional bank branches until 2026. Smaller player the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank has also announced a pause. In contrast, NAB has closed or announced the closure of 29 regional branches and 14 branches in metropolitan areas since 1 March, leaving regional communities such as Kyogle and Woolgoolga in New South Wales, and Inglewood and Mitchell in Queensland with limited banking options. The bank said the branches were closed because an increasing number of customers were choosing to do their banking online or over the phone, with only a small percentage of customers relying on in-person banking.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But a separate parliamentary committee heard that NAB\u2019s data about in-person banking only counted interactions that included a transaction; branch visits for advice or other assistance were not included. The group executive of personal banking at NAB, Rachel Slade, told a hearing of the parliamentary standing committee on economics last month it was \u201cvery hard to measure non-transactional activity\u201d. In a statement to Guardian Australia, NAB\u2019s executive general manager for retail Krissie Jones, said the decision to close a branch was \u201cnever easy\u201d but was based on changing customer behaviour, including \u201cthe reality that less people rely on branches for their banking\u201d.   Related: Westpac\u2019s U-turn on rural bank branch closures a win for regional customers, Queensland MPs say    Jones said NAB customers could use Australia Post\u2019s Bank@Post service at 3,400 locations, including 1,100 in regional areas where there was no local branch. The bank said measuring transactions was the most useful way to track how often customers used in-person services at a bank branch and suggested that counting the total number of people who visited a branch might be misleading, for example, a parent entering a branch accompanied by their children.  The bank said also fewer people were using cheques or handling cash. NAB chief executive Ross McEwan told the standing committee 93% of transactions that physically occurred at a bank branch were digital, and 99% of all flows through banks were \u201cof a digital nature, including payments, so [the change in behaviour has] been quite dramatic\u201d. The national secretary of the Finance Sector Union, Julia Angrisano, said the union was concerned the information and data NAB was relying on when closing a branch ignored the vital and essential services provided by bank workers. \u201cThey have been using data to justify a closure that reflects only over-the-counter transactions, ignoring all the other essential services performed by bank staff,\u201d said Angrisano. That included deceased estates, assisting customers who were experiencing elder financial abuse or supporting customers who were experiencing family and domestic violence or who have been victims of fraud and other online scams, she said. \u201cThese are sensitive issues and bank workers are helping their customers across all aspects of their banking needs, not just those that are counted as over-the-counter transactions.\u201d The senate inquiry into bank closures in regional Australia has received more than 550 submissions.

Court documents also state she is also charged with four counts of the attempted murder of her former partner, Simon Patterson, including on the day of the fatal lunch. He was not present for that meal. Patterson, 49, appeared in person in the Latrobe Valley magistrates court, in Victoria\u2019s south-east, on Friday morning. She has previously denied wrongdoing. Patterson appeared in the dock dressed in a grey jumper, accompanied by security guards. She glanced at the media throng as she entered the dock and stared straight ahead during the hearing. Patterson said \u201cgood morning\u201d when greeted by the magistrate, Tim Walsh, but otherwise appeared emotionless. She shook her head when Walsh asked whether her street address should be redacted from the police charge sheet. \u201cI think they\u2019ve all been there, your honour,\u201d her lawyer, Bill Doogue, said in reference to the media. A committal mention hearing has been set for 3 May, the court heard.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Walsh said the matter could be moved to Melbourne if the committal process would be delayed by hearing it at the Latrobe Valley magistrates court. Walsh told Patterson he wanted to ensure the matter \u201cprogresses through the system as quickly as reasonably possible rather than having you languish for too long\u201d. The court heard police had sought a 20-week adjournment in order to analyse computer equipment seized at Patterson\u2019s Leongatha home during a property search on Thursday. The defence agreed to the delay. Walsh expressed frustration about the length of time requested, citing the fact that police had already felt confident enough in the case to charge her with a \u201ctriple murder\u201d. No application for bail was made and Patterson remains remanded in custody. Doogue said there were no custody matter issues. Gail and Don Patterson \u2013 the parents of Patterson\u2019s former husband \u2013 and Wilkinson died in hospital after eating beef wellington at lunch. Wilkinson\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, is still recovering after spending almost two months in hospital receiving treatment. According to police documents filed in court, Patterson is accused of attempting to murder her former partner in November 2021, in May 2022, on 6 September 2022 and on 29 July. Police allege Patterson also attempted to murder Ian Wilkinson on 29 July. Patterson previously said she was \u201cdevastated to think that these mushrooms may have contributed to the illness suffered by my loved ones\u201d, according to the ABC. She said she had \u201cno reason to hurt these people, whom I loved\u201d. Patterson confirmed the meal in question was a beef wellington pie. On Thursday, Victoria police confirmed homicide squad detectives had arrested Patterson. She was interviewed by police at Wonthaggi police station after police searched her Leongatha home, where the fatal meal was served. Det Insp Dean Thomas said on Thursday that the investigation had been incredibly complex. \u201cOver the last three months, this investigation has been subjected to incredibly intense levels of public scrutiny and curiosity. I cannot think of another investigation that has generated this level of media and public interest, not only here in Victoria but also nationally and internationally,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is particularly important that we keep in mind that at the heart of this, three people have lost their lives. These are three people who by all accounts were much beloved in their communities and are greatly missed by their loved ones.\u201d", "Labor\u2019s refusal to tie public hospital funding to full reproductive care condemned as \u2018outrageous\u2019 [2023-09-05T15:00:34Z]": "Despite harrowing stories from women about having to \u201cshop around\u201d for abortion care even when their pregnancies are unviable, the federal government will not make providing abortion services a condition tied to millions of dollars in funding it allocates to major public hospitals. An investigation by Guardian Australia detailed the still widespread practice of Catholic hospitals across Australia using the cover of religion to opt out of providing reproductive care, with devastating consequences.   Related: \u2018I was shocked\u2019: Catholic-run public hospitals refuse to provide birth control and abortion    When it delivered its final report in May, the Senate inquiry into reproductive healthcare access recommended increased accessibility of abortion services at public hospitals. But the inquiry fell short of making it a requirement in order to receive public funding. In 2019, the then shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, indicated Labor would tie funding to public hospitals with willingness to provide abortion services, a policy since dumped by federal Labor. When Guardian Australia asked the prime minister\u2019s office whether Labor would revert to its 2019 policy, it was referred to the assistant minister for health and aged care, Ged Kearney, who did not respond to questions about whether she supported calls to make federal funding conditional on providing full reproductive care. \u201cAll Australians deserve equitable access to the healthcare that they need,\u201d she said. Without reform to funding policies, Dr Ronli Sifris, the deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University, said the disturbing inequities detailed by Guardian Australia would continue. \u201cThe fact that public hospitals in Australia are legally able to conscientiously object means the vast majority of abortions are provided through the private sector,\u201d Sifris said. \u201cThis is unacceptable. And it would not be accepted if it were any other area of health care.\u201d Liz Wilkes is based in Toowoomba, Queensland, where she is managing director of My Midwives, the largest private midwifery practice in Australia. She said the refusal of the Mater \u2013 the most advanced obstetric hospital in Queensland \u2013 to provide certain reproductive healthcare services was affecting women in rural and regional areas in particular. \u201cToowoomba refers directly to the Mater as it is our closest tertiary hospital and in a situation where women have travelled to the Mater for a scan only to find out there are complications in their pregnancy like congenital anomalies where a termination is required, they then need to be transferred somewhere else to get that termination done,\u201d Wilkes said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not OK when the Mater is receiving significant government funding. After getting the results of a scan, if there is a problem, these women can\u2019t stay there and be treated and cared for. They then are transferred to another hospital to undergo further treatment and have the termination. \u201cI think in situations where women are already traumatised and stressed that making them travel like that is absolutely not OK, to find it\u2019s not possible due to these crazy religiously driven restrictions on services. It is just unacceptable.\u201d A Mater spokesperson said the hospital clearly communicates the services it does provide and, where necessary, refers patients to counselling, support and connection to alternative specialists and hospitals.   Related: \u2018Designed to shame women\u2019: Australian pharmacies urged to scrap forms for emergency contraception    The Greens senator Larissa Waters, who chaired the Senate inquiry into reproductive healthcare access, said; \u201cIt is outrageous that private hospitals receiving public funding denied healthcare to pregnant people in need. \u201cWe could not get consensus agreement through the Senate inquiry to require private hospitals to provide abortion care as a condition of receiving public funding. \u201cWomen\u2019s stories of their additional suffering, stress and cost when told a foetus was no longer viable but they couldn\u2019t end the pregnancy at that hospital is totally unacceptable.\u201d She called on the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, \u201cto intervene and revert to Labor\u2019s 2019 policy of requiring private hospitals to provide abortion care as a condition of receiving public funding\u201d.", "Doctors v pharmacists: who benefits from Australia\u2019s turf war over prescriptions? [2023-04-24T15:00:13Z]": " The You Deserve More campaign from the Australian Medical Association has an alarming message: allowing pharmacists to prescribe a wider range of medicines is a threat to patient safety and undermines the health system. Queensland now allows pharmacists to prescribe medicines for uncomplicated urinary tract infections after a successful pilot. Other states including New South Wales and Victoria are developing their own pilots so pharmacists can administer medicines such as health and travel vaccinations and prescribe drugs for UTIs, skin ailments, ear infections and birth control. Patients are \u201cpart of an experiment\u201d if they take part, the You Deserve More campaign warns. \u201cPatients deserve access to the full range of treatments and holistic doctor-led care, rather than being treated as a customer at a counter,\u201d AMA president Steve Robson says. \u201cThey deserve the care of someone who has the qualifications to properly diagnose them, who can take the time to ensure they get the best health outcomes.\u201d The Pharmacy Guild disagrees. \u201cCurrently it may be quicker for a woman in metropolitan Melbourne to fly to Queensland to be treated for a non-complex urinary tract infection at a pharmacy than it is to book an appointment to see a local GP,\u201d the guild\u2019s Victorian branch president Anthony Tassone says.   Related: Who will benefit from NSW plan to let pharmacists prescribe medicines \u2013 and why are GPs opposed?    \u201cPharmacists are highly skilled and qualified medicines experts, who already assess, diagnose and treat common conditions every day.\u201d Dr Elizabeth Deveny, the chief executive of the Consumers Health Forum, says patients are sick of what she describes as \u201ca turf war between the pharmacist and the doctors groups\u201d. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not hearing from either of these groups is that they\u2019re engaging with everyday Australians to find out what they actually want and alleviate any concerns,\u201d Deveny says. \u201cIf doctors think these prescribing schemes are so dangerous, why isn\u2019t the AMA coming up with a list of five questions consumers should ask their pharmacists to be safe? \u201cThey\u2019re still just arguing that this prescribing shouldn\u2019t happen. But it is happening, and I would like to see the doctors and pharmacists groups to stop the turf war, work together and listen to consumers.\u201d The CHF has consulted consumers and Deveny says people broadly support pharmacists being able to prescribe for more ailments than they do currently. It is increasingly difficult to find a bulk-billing doctor, appointment availability can lead to delays and people with uncomplicated ailments want the convenience of going straight to their pharmacist.

So consumers want checks and balances in place.\u201d But the message from the AMA that prescribing schemes are dangerous and harmful is not washing with consumers, she says. \u201cConsumers are not frightened by pharmacy prescribing, but they do have questions,\u201d Deveny says. \u201cAnd every time we ask them what they want and need, they say they want cheaper, faster access to primary care. Instead, what they\u2019re getting is commercial interests and turf wars getting in the way.\u201d The productivity commission report on efficiency in health identified that using pharmacists to their full scope is an efficient and effective way to improve access to healthcare, particularly in regional and rural areas. The Strengthening Medicare taskforce also recognised this need.   Related: ACT becomes first Australian jurisdiction to offer free universal access to abortions    The Victorian pharmacy prescribing pilot, based on Queensland\u2019s program, will see pharmacists able treat some mild skin conditions and uncomplicated UTIs in women, administer public health vaccinations and reissue oral contraceptive prescriptions. No start date has been given. The Victorian department of health is also working closely with New South Wales Health, which is preparing to run a clinical trial allowing pharmacists to dispense medicine for UTIs. But while states and territories work together to prepare to roll out their prescribing programs, the AMA has doubled down. \u201cThese services are not backed by evidence and bypass the national checks and balances intended to protect you,\u201d the You Deserve More campaign website, launched in April, states. Yet evidence suggests pharmacy prescribing schemes, when run with checks and balances in place and evaluated properly, benefit consumers. The \u201cUrinary Tract Infection Pharmacy Pilot\u201d that ran in Queensland from June 2020 and which was made permanent statewide in October 2022 received no formal reports or complaints regarding specific cases from doctors, pharmacists or patients. More than 10,000 women accessed treatment during the pilot and no concerns have been raised with Queensland Health since it was made permanent, a Queensland Health spokesperson said.

In the UK, pharmacists with additional training have been independently prescribing since 2006. A UK report found the scheme was safe, clinically appropriate and was generally viewed positively by patients. Similarly, two Canadian studies of pharmacist prescribing for UTIs and patients at risk of heart problems found pharmacist prescribing led to better clinical outcomes. A NSW Health spokesperson said a University of Newcastle-led group including GPs, infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, rural clinicians and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will ensure the clinical trial there is safe. \u201cThe principles guiding the UTI clinical trial already include a number of important safeguards, including the selection of the patient population,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe trial will involve women aged 18 to 65 years of age who are displaying symptoms consistent with uncomplicated UTI and who do not have significant risk factors identified through the consultation process.\u201d The federal health minister, Mark Butler, said the government was monitoring the various pilot prescribing programs.

The light aircraft landed at an airstrip in the central Queensland town of Monto to refuel on Tuesday when officers swooped and made five arrests. Five men from NSW, who police allege were part of an organised crime syndicate, were charged with importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine. They face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Police allege two men had flown a twin-engine Beechcraft aircraft under the radar from a rural area south-west of Sydney on Monday to the PNG town of Bulolo, where they picked up 52kg of methamphetamine. Two pilots and three other men who allegedly provided ground support were arrested on Tuesday in Monto, where police seized five duffle bags allegedly containing the drugs.    Kirsty Schofield, assistant commissioner of the AFP, told reporters in Sydney that police allege the men were attempting to establish a supply chain of illicit drugs into Australia through PNG. \u201cWe will allege the man had been meticulously planning this operation for months,\u201d Schofield said. \u201cWhat they did not know however is that law enforcement had been tracking these people for the same period of time.\u201d She said the investigation was a joint operation between the AFP, NSW police and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. \u201cBlack flights\u201d are designed to avoid detection by logging false flight plans or avoiding flight plans entirely, and flying at a low altitude or turning off flight monitoring systems, the AFP said. \u201cIn this case, the aircraft was flying at very low altitude and had its transponder turned off. For obvious reasons this is a very dangerous venture for other aircraft in the air but also for the people on board themselves,\u201d Schofield said. The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) provided support for the investigation on request from the AFP.

[2024-01-20T19:00:08Z]": "Kerry Plowright had his feet up and was watching TV one evening late last year when his phone warned of incoming hail. \u201cI was stunned when I walked out the door because there was just this roar,\u201d he says, describing the sound of hailstones hitting roofs in the New South Wales town of Kingscliff. He had just enough time to move his cars under canvas sails, sparing them from damage. Plowright isn\u2019t alone in having little warning before wild weather during Australia\u2019s seemingly relentless summer of extremes. This season may include a second tropical cyclone to strike Queensland.   Related: Cyclone forecasting boosted by artificial intelligence offers earlier path tracking    The Albanese government has launched an inquiry into warnings issued by the Bureau of Meteorology and emergency authorities after complaints by councils and others that some alerts lacked accuracy and timeliness. But Plowright\u2019s case is a little different \u2013 his hail heads-up was triggered by data generated by his own firm, Early Warning Network. Early Warning Network analyses data from radars and remote sensors to detect and issue alerts on extreme heat, rainfall and flooding. It counts local councils and big insurers among its customers. Private businesses have long offered services based on data from BoM or agencies such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). But Early Warning Network is starting to test artificial intelligence models that promise to make a lot more weather information available both rapidly and at low cost.

How AI can help us prepare for weather extremes Juliette Murphy, a water resources engineer, is similarly excited. She founded FloodMapp to give communities more time to prepare after monitoring devastating floods in Queensland\u2019s Lockyer region in 2011 and then in the Canadian city of Calgary two years later. FloodMapp uses machines that learn from each model run as well as traditional physics-based hydrology and hydraulic models. Even relatively basic computers can comb through \u201creally large datasets\u201d quickly to identify likely effects of a flood, she says. Her clients include Queensland\u2019s fire and emergency services. Its results complement BoM\u2019s, helping authorities decide which homes to evacuate and which roads to close. \u201cThat\u2019s important not least because almost half of flood deaths involve people in cars,\u201d Murphy says.   Related: Flood warnings prompt evacuations in NT as Queensland braces for incoming cyclone    A BoM spokesperson says the bureau had been \u201cproactively and safely engaging with artificial intelligence capabilities for several years\u201d. \u201cThis area of research is one of many initiatives the bureau actively pursues to improve its services to government, emergency management partners and the community,\u201d she says. Justin Freeman, a computer scientist, ran BoM\u2019s research team which was working on machine learning before he left in in late 2022 to set up his own firm, Flowershift. Flowershift is building a geospatial model trained on existing observational data. \u201cWe would be filling in gaps around what the current forecast products are\u201d, such as providing forecasts in remote regions of Australia or beyond, Freeman says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more flexibility to be able to explore things [outside BoM] and use technologies which are very new,\u201d says Freeman, who still does contract work for the bureau. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this whole new different class of models which are completely different to what [the bureau had] been running for the last 50 years.\u201d There are many potential uses for models that can analyse data cheaply and then supply localised information. Farmers, for instance, could ask, \u201cShould I spray my crops this week?\u201d and be told why or why not, Freeman says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long that we\u2019ve had access to something like ChatGPT,\u201d he says. \u201cLook forward like another two years, five years \u2013 it\u2019s just going to accelerate and get better and better.\u201d The limitations of AI Some BoM and climate researchers, though, caution how much AI-based models, such Google\u2019s GraphCast or Nvidia\u2019s FourCastNet, can improve on numerical models that churn out a range of probabilities.    Related: \u2018Very scary\u2019: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s pledge to build advanced AI alarms experts    \u201cFor \u2018simple\u2019 weather forecasting and for downscaling physical model data I reckon [there\u2019s] massive potential,\u201d one bureau scientist says. \u201cFor warning us of real dangers when the atmosphere gets violent, I\u2019d be very cautious. \u201cAnd with climate change, we need to better understand things that are well outside the norm.\u201d Sanaa Hobeichi, a post-doctoral researcher at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes, says there are still benefits despite the limitations. Existing climate models typically offer only \u201ccoarse\u201d resolutions, such as estimating rainfall changes over areas 150km by 150km. In Sydney, for instance, a model that size would capture the city, mountains and a lot besides and so be of limited use. Google\u2019s GraphCast forecast model has a resolution down to 28km by 28km, while Hobeichi says some AI can model just 5km by 5km. A challenge, though, is that machine-learning techniques inherit and potentially extrapolate imperfections of the traditional models they train on. Jyoteeshkumar Reddy Papari, a post-doctoral CSIRO researcher, notes that the ECMWF was initially sceptical of AI but has lately started its own experimental model. It is also displaying several others on its website, including Google\u2019s. \u201cCountries that don\u2019t have good meteorological organisations are relying on these machine learning models because they are super easy to learn and are publicly available,\u201d he says. \u201cSo some of the African countries are using these forecasts.\u201d Google researchers last year claimed GraphCast \u201csignificantly outperforms the most accurate\u201d operational systems in 90% of 1380 targets. Tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers and extreme temperatures were predictions it made which were better than traditional models and improvements are ongoing.   Related: AI will affect 40% of jobs and probably worsen inequality, says IMF head    \u201cOne particular example we often mention was Hurricane Lee, because it was the first time that we observed in real time how GraphCast was predicting a hurricane trajectory that originally differed from the traditional systems, and eventually was shown to be the right trajectory,\u201d said Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, a Goggle researcher. \u201cIt was detected in real time and it was verified by independent sources.\u201d Current tracking of the potential cyclone in the Coral Sea \u2013 to be named Kirrily if it forms as expected by Monday \u2013 will also be monitored to see how models compare. ECMWF\u2019s machine learning coordinator, Matthew Chantry, says AI models are \u201ca very exciting avenue as a companion system for traditional forecasting\u201d although the latter retains some advantages. \u201cTropical cyclone intensity estimates are a good example,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether these flaws are maintained as the technology matures \u2013 it is still very early days.\u201d Authorities act based on the probabilities calculated by traditional models but that needs a very large supercomputer. \u201cWith AI forecasts, this is dramatically reduced, with some estimates suggesting a 1000-times reduction in the energy to make a forecast. Cheaper systems could therefore be a force for equality. \u201cThis reduced cost could also be invested into larger ensembles, meaning that we have a better idea of low-probability but extreme events that could occur.\u201d And as for predicting effects of a heating planet? \u201cThe problem is significantly harder than weather forecasting, with less data,\u201d says Chantry. \u201cThat said, in a changing climate, where evidence suggests an increase in extreme events, then any help with predicting these events has significant value.\u201d", "Clare Nowland: charges upgraded to manslaughter for NSW police officer accused of Tasering 95-year-old [2023-11-28T23:06:24Z]": "The New South Wales police officer accused of Tasering 95-year-old Clare Nowland who later died has been charged with manslaughter after advice from the state\u2019s director of public prosecutions.

The late Nationals elder and former deputy prime minister had long held the line against One Nation\u2019s divisive rhetoric from Pauline Hanson\u2019s first entry into parliament in 1996. Fischer was joined by fellow Nationals members such as former Queensland senator Ron Boswell, who in his farewell speech told parliament that his efforts to defeat Hanson and her party were his \u201cgreatest achievement\u201d. Current Nationals have had less clarity on One Nation, in spite of the party\u2019s history of singling out groups for their heritage or religion, whether it be Indigenous Australians, Asian Australians or Muslim Australians.   Related: The future of my grandchildren is in the hands of all Australians. Help bring our dream alive | Roy Gibson    Barnaby Joyce told his constituents in the 2022 election that One Nation had changed, that the party of 10 or 15 years ago was \u201cnot the party of today\u201d, as he justified his decision to preference the One Nation candidate. But it was a step closer when Joyce joined Hanson, broadcaster Alan Jones and former Labor minister Gary Johns for an event on Friday in his New England electorate, advertised as helping people to \u201cunderstand why you should oppose the voice to parliament\u201d. The reality was it placed Joyce on stage with someone his own Indigenous constituents accused of using racist talking points and \u201creally dehumanising\u201d language. Held in Tamworth, it was the first regional event of the Recognise A Better Way group, one of the most high-profile organisations campaigning against the voice. The group is led by Nyunggai Warren Mundine and its committee has Indigenous and non-Indigenous members, although none of the Indigenous committee members spoke in Tamworth that night. Whatever you think of the protagonists or the Indigenous voice to parliament, the speaker list promised controversy. In doing so, it provided an audience to hang a lantern over the no campaign. The purpose of that spotlight in a rural community is to show those wavering that there may be a critical mass against the voice, who may be people they know \u2013 people who have influence within their own social circles. So with First Nations people in the audience rather than on stage, regional Australia got a taste of what might lie ahead as we debate the proposed Indigenous voice. The political strategy boiled down to this slogan: if you don\u2019t know, vote no \u2013 reminiscent of the republic referendum and designed to sow doubt. But the idea was bedded down with spurious claims from the speakers and long forgotten terms like \u201cintermarriage\u201d. It is likely these people will lead the no campaign in regional areas with Joyce as a key protagonist. Indeed Joyce told the audience, which was a mix of constituents and visitors from as far as Western Australia, that he was \u201cpassionate\u201d in his opposition. It is four months since the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, fronted the cameras with Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and most of his party to reveal the decision to oppose the voice, claiming it would not close the gap for Indigenous people. The Calare MP Andrew Gee quit the Nationals days later to support the voice and sit as an independent in a seat with a rising tree-change demographic. Since then, the Nationals as a party have avoided front-running the no case. But in contrast with Littleproud, Joyce is keen to take part and is arguing on different grounds from closing the gap. \u201cIf one group has a right based on their DNA, another group does not have that right,\u201d Joyce told the Tamworth crowd. Price is the other key voice of conservative MPs, as the face of the Fair Australia campaign against the voice. She has argued her consultations with people in remote areas show they either didn\u2019t know about the voice or didn\u2019t want it.    It is clear from the Tamworth meeting that anti-voice forums could get a willing audience in regional areas.    This will leave Joyce and Price as the two rural MPs most associated with the no case. And what is clear in regional areas is the desire for detail flagged by audiences that both support and oppose the voice \u2013 a fact that Joyce is using. He described the proposal as \u201csneaky\u201d for lacking detail, even if he then painted a very detailed and dire picture of what the voice may become. Just weeks ago, the first regional forum was held with Labor senator and special envoy for reconciliation Pat Dodson in Ballarat. The audience appeared to be in favour but they were also hungry for the practicalities. \u201cPeople who live in the regions are far more practical,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey want to know how things work. Whereas we\u2019re talking about a principle here, which is significant because it\u2019s about the constitution. In a moral sense and an ethical sense, is this a good thing for us to do?\u201d   Related: Yunupingu, Yol\u014bu leader and campaigner for Indigenous rights, dies aged 74    Other campaigns are rolling out, including one from the folks who bought you the Voices For movement \u2013 with a series of kitchen table conversations. Under the banner Together, Yes, these groups are designed to promote quieter, respectful conversations inside homes that fly under the radar of the noisy media debate. The voice process has been a long time in the making. The list of community groups consulted during the co-design phase of the voice is long. Yet for all that consultation, it is clear from the Tamworth meeting that anti-voice forums could get a willing audience in regional areas. While that is sometimes the nature of democracy, the key questions is how voters in 2023 will react to divisive politics and how politicians write their own legacies.", "Australia\u2019s drought planning should begin now, not when the rain dries up | Gabrielle Chan [2023-03-06T14:00:28Z]": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that we rarely talk about drought when we are not in drought. You could loosely call it the \u201chydro-illogical cycle\u201d. For a dry continent such as ours, how we manage rain and its deficit is a big piece of both agricultural and environmental policy. Historically, we usually plan for a drought in the most emotionally draining and politically sensitive time: in the middle of a mammoth dry. Right now, we are in this weird stage, after three wet years, of maybe looking down the barrel of three dry years, according to one scenario in the latest government forecasts. It\u2019s not quite the biblical cycle of seven years of plenty and seven years of lean but it does present a small window of opportunity to talk about how we should manage the next big dry. Australian farmers have had a blinder  On Tuesday, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares) is delivering its latest forecasts on what levels of food and fibre they expect from Australian farmers.   Related: Drought and flooding rains: the Murray-Darling Basin water rights balancing act    Complacency is understandable, reading the top line of the 2023 Agricultural Commodities Report. In short, Australian farmers have had a blinder, which is a technical term for an excellent season.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Three wet years are unusual enough for Australia but commodity prices were high, competitor countries had their own droughts, and Russia invaded Ukraine \u2013 restricting the two countries\u2019 outputs that provide 30% of the world\u2019s wheat. Abares expects Australian farmers to deliver their biggest production year on record in 2022-23 by volume and value, worth $90bn. That is $2bn bigger than the previous record set in 2021-22. Western Australia farmers appear to have been dealt the best hand with record-breaking deliveries in grain across the state amounting to a harvest of 25.6m tonnes. In essence, those farmers planted the largest ever area of winter crops, got rain at the right time and had minimal frosts. For context, the WA grain forecast is 61% higher than the 10-year average to 2021-22. Given WA is a big wheat and barley producer, that is a lot of bread and beer. South Australia is also estimated to reach a new record of 12.6m tonnes, 19% higher than its previous record. Flooding in the eastern states crimped the bumper year for two reasons. Firstly, some crops were damaged or downgraded. In cropping regions, New South Wales and Victoria were the worst affected. An estimated 8.1% and 2.9% of cropping land in these states respectively were significantly damaged by floods alone. Secondly, farmers could not get onto some paddocks to plant their next crop, particularly in southern Queensland, and northern and central New South Wales. Abares is expecting a return to drier conditions in 2023-24, which will mean total agricultural production is expected to fall 10% to $81bn. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, is expected to urge the audience at the Abares outlook conference not to be complacent of the risk of future drought, even after three years of floods. \u201cWhile three seasons of La Ni\u00f1a have contributed to record-breaking production, we can\u2019t be complacent about the risk that future drought poses,\u201d Watt said. The climate challenge ahead Things get tricky in the years ahead, for farmers dealing with the climate crisis and government forecasters. Abares has tried to do something different by presenting two models that juggle various economic and climate scenarios over the next five years.   Related: The NSW floods have been as gut wrenching as drought and caused more damage     Abares\u2019 executive director, Jared Greenville, said the different scenario forecasts are designed to acknowledge the variability due to climate change. \u201cThe problem is the long history is not a very good predictor of the future any more,\u201d he said. The \u201cbaseline\u201d scenario assumes inflation remains high but declines in 2024 in combination with less rainfall due to El Ni\u00f1o conditions. The \u201cdrier\u201d scenario assumes interest rates stay higher for longer, with three back-to-back El Ni\u00f1os. In short, we are going to get dry, as per Australian cycles, but in the drier scenario, we could also have lower prices for our crops combined with higher prices for inputs like fertiliser and diesel, combined with high interest rates at a time when the seasons get tougher. Abares also confirms what is obvious in the agricultural real estate pages. Reserve Bank data shows total agricultural business debt in Australia jumped by 22% in real terms from December 2019 to December 2022. Farmers are spending on expanding as the land price booms. They have mostly been able to service that debt in the short term because their land prices keep rising. But a drought combined with sustained high rates will test that capacity to pay those interest bills. So where does this crystal ball gazing leave us? Even while flood victims remain homeless and some communities may begin sliding into drought, policy makers and advocacy groups have a sweet spot of sorts, before the next extreme comes our way. That is because climate change has caused this concertina effect between the extremes of droughts and floods, affording less time for communities to recover. We need to take this chance in between the hydro-illogical cycle to prepare calmly and rationally.

North Sydney MP Kylea Tink, who grew up in Coonabarabran on the edge of the Pilliga, returned to NSW\u2019s north-western slopes on Wednesday with fellow independent Sophie Scamps to hear the concerns on local landholders. They were invited by the former federal independent Tony Windsor, who has a farm in Werris Creek on the Liverpool Plains.   Related: The farmers fighting gas projects in NSW are politically savvy, but they face a giant in Santos | Gabrielle Chan    The battle over the project has come to a head after Santos restarted seismic testing in the area in late January. Santos has also started contacting landholders to gain access for the Hunter gas pipeline, which the NSW government declared critical state-significant infrastructure for \u201ceconomic reasons\u201d in December last year. Although Santos holds two petroleum exploration licences south of the 95,000 hectare Narrabri coal seam gas project, it has yet to confirm its plans. Santos did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia. It comes as the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, last week approved another project by Santos to open 116 new coal seam gas wells in Queensland\u2019s Surat Basin. Tink and Scamps flew over the Liverpool Plains and then met with farmers and traditional owners in a community forum to discuss the gas projects.    Tink said that if both Labor and Coalition won\u2019t listen to communities on issues such as coal seam gas, change would have to come from the crossbench. \u201c[The Santos project] is a really good example of this,\u201d Tink said. \u201cWe sit in the largest crossbench in the house with 16 [MPs], four of them are Greens. It is about changing the people who are carrying the message stick so they are not using it to beat you over the head.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Scamps told the audience about her experience organising a successful community campaign during the 2022 election, and recommended farmers concerned about the gas project endorse a community-selected independent.  \u201cIf you want someone to genuinely represent this community from within this community, you need a community independent,\u201d Scamps said. \u201cBecause who is representing the farmers?\u201d Helen Strang, a Tambar Springs farmer and president of the Tambar Springs branch of the Country Women\u2019s Association, attended and said locals had written letters about the issue and visited their state politicians to no avail. \u201cI think a lot of us are feeling very much taken for granted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken 12 years of our lives, spending time away from our beautiful families and growing beautiful produce.\u201d    Traditional Kamilaroi descendent Mitchum Neave, who is chairman of Red Chief Local Aboriginal Land Council, said governments were overruling First Nations people on the Narrabri gas project.  \u201cHow can governments justify the overruling of traditional people?\u201d he said. \u201cNot just us. We have all these farmers as well who don\u2019t want [the project]. Government departments, environmental departments and government planning departments need to be held accountable. \u201cWe are leaving our great-grandchildren a mess for a handful of dollars today.\u201d    Kate Gunn, a farmer who hosted the information day, said she was hoping more people would realise that developing coal seam gas on the Liverpool Plains was an \u201cexceptionally bad idea\u201d. Gunn is one of a younger generation of farmers. Soon after she returned to the land, the first big coalmining project was announced for the region. Since then, both BHP\u2019s Caroona coal project and Shenhua\u2019s Watermark coalmine have been dropped. Now she is dealing with the Santos project. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of us that are very committed and the number is growing,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to town yesterday and was asked for my phone number and people said \u2018make sure you ring me next time you have a protest or a blockade. I want to come and hold a sign\u2019.\u201d Darling Downs farmer Liza Balmain travelled 800km from Cecil Plains in Queensland with Suzie Holt, a former independent candidate for Groom, to meet with the farmers and share their experiences with coal seam gas developments. Balmain said their community held their first rallies in Cecil Plains in 2010 after they discovered Arrow Energy were exploring for gas in their area on the Condamine floodplain 75km west of Toowoomba.

He drives 325km to Melbourne each week for work, even though he says there is enough demand locally to keep him fully employed. \u201cI can work five days a week in Wangaratta and earn the same as I can earn working two-and-a-half days in Melbourne,\u201d he says. \u201cBut why would I want a 50% income reduction?\u201d The regions, despite the high demand, simply don\u2019t pay as much as the city. Block says the health system \u201cactively works to discourage rural specialist practice\u201d by failing to provide funding for specialist services. \u201cFor GPs, there are lots of incentive programmes,\u201d Block says. \u201cThe government will pay for GPs to move to the country, so there\u2019s a lot of support. \u201cBut the public sector doesn\u2019t have any money to employ me [as a specialist psychiatrist]. The private sector doesn\u2019t have a private mother-baby unit, so it means I rely on Medicare ... and so the amount of income you can earn is reduced compared to the city.\u201d   Related: \u2018If it takes a village, where\u2019s mine?\u2019: new mums in rural Australia lack mental health services    His comments come as a rural health survey conducted by newspaper group ACM found regional and rural patients are travelling an average of 122km to see a specialist, while more than half are waiting weeks or months to see a GP.  The survey also revealed female farmers were forced to travel 100km on average to give birth, with a third travelling more than 150km. The Rural Doctors Association of Australia\u2019s chief executive, Peta Rutherford, used to live in outback Queensland. She was not surprised by the survey results.  \u201cIf you are like 100km away [from the hospital where you will give birth], the advice is often that you need to relocate two to four weeks beforehand,\u201d she says. \u201cSo the social impacts on mother is huge.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Rutherford says these women are away from their support networks for an extended period of time, causing \u201ca lot of anxiety, mental health issues and a whole range of other things\u201d. Block says the pandemic, cost of living pressures, floods and bushfires have had a cumulative effect on increasing demand for mental health services in the regions.  \u201cEveryone has been swamped with business, psychiatrists, psychologists \u2013 we got more work than we can do,\u201d he says. \u201cBetween the north-east and Melbourne, I\u2019ve been getting five new referral requests a week.

Prof Mathew Coleman, a rural psychiatrist and the chair of rural and remote mental health practice at the University of Western Australia, says the impact of natural disasters is often under-appreciated in gauging demand for mental health services in the bush. \u201cThere\u2019s a concept called rural adversity, which is natural disasters beset regional people at a higher rate than metropolitan and it\u2019s not ubiquitous,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cThat\u2019s an additional burden on communities and an additional social determinant that\u2019s not experienced at the same intensity and extent as populations in metropolitan areas, and that\u2019s not accounted for.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s the reverse: the per capita spend on mental health services in regional and rural communities is lower than in the cities, despite the prevalence being the same and the morbidity associated with the diagnosis being worse.   Related: Mental health outcomes are worse in the bush, partly because it\u2019s easier to get a gun than get help    \u201cSo you get worse outcomes from regional people, despite them experiencing exactly the same problems as city people,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cHaving an extra three psychiatrists in Mildura makes the difference between a functioning and a non-functioning system. Three psychiatrists in Melbourne makes no difference at all. \u201cSo the scale is quite modest, but the outcomes are significant in terms of changing the landscape.\u201d Coleman said he\u2019s frequently heard the problem is \u201ctoo hard\u201d to fix, but that regional practitioners could provide the solutions. \u201cAt the moment, rural and remote [Australia] is considered all the same,\u201d he says. \u201cA third of Australians live outside of capital cities but they are underrepresented at the table. Their agency hasn\u2019t evolved.\u201d Rutherford says the lack of incentives for specialists to work in regional areas is an area of concern. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of money through the colleges for professional development support, but there\u2019s certainly not the incentives for consultants, specialists to work rurally,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to incentivise more consultants coming out.

The similarities between Australia in 2019 and Canada in 2023 were stark and disturbing. Like Australia, Canada was in the grip of drought. Like Australia \u201cunprecedented\u201d was the word of the moment. While Canada burned this year, so did Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, the Canary Islands and the US. The summer of 2023 was the hottest on record in the northern hemisphere and humanity was in wildfire\u2019s thrall.    Our existing volunteers are growing older and fewer people are joining    Across the globe, amid fire there were floods and a seemingly endless stream of other climate catastrophes. None of these individual events can be directly attributed to the carbon-driven climate crisis but together they tell a story that can no longer be denied. If this is the future, what can be done? The challenge of the climate crisis can, and often does, feel hopeless. All of our individual efforts to reduce our carbon footprint are important but can seem trivial compared with the scale of the problem.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  To face the climate onslaught we will need resilience and a key part of building that resilience will be rekindling the ethos of volunteering. Volunteering has a proud history in Australia. Everyday Australians doing their bit for their communities in fire brigades, state emergency services, St John Ambulance, Lions, Rotary and countless other community organisations. But in recent decades this spirit has waned. Our existing volunteers are growing older and fewer people are joining. The increasing costs of living and pressures of modern life all make it harder to find time, but we can\u2019t build resilience alone, we need work together.   Related: Hail Australia\u2019s public school P&amp;Cs, the unsung heroes of the election sausage | Fiona Katauskas    We need more volunteers and they need more support. Not every volunteer needs to hold a hose. You may not feel comfortable jumping on a fire truck or piloting a rescue boat through flood waters but behind the frontline there is an army of volunteers providing communications, organising meals and emergency housing, informing the public and helping their neighbours prepare and recover. Ask around, there is bound to be a role that suits your skill and interests. Whether they are on the frontlines or bringing up the rear, volunteers need support \u2013 from family, from friends and in the workplace. I couldn\u2019t be a firefighter without the selfless support of my partner and family. Never more so than in 2019 when I would come home exhausted to good meals, clean clothes and loving hugs. While I was out on the trucks, my wonderful family dealt with the mundane duties of everyday life, the worry about my safety and even the stress of preparing for evacuation when fire was forecast to threaten our own home. You may not be able to volunteer yourself, but if you can support a family member who does that is just as valuable as if you were holding the hose. If the support of my family made volunteering easier, work has sometimes been a different story. In October 2019 I wrote an email to my manager thanking them for releasing me for a few days in the previous fortnight and hoping that the worst was over. Little did I know. As the days became weeks and then months, the tensions with my city-based manager grew. It was only when blankets of smoke brought the scale of the emergency home to Sydney that the tension eased and they suggested an article about my firefighting for the newsletter. I was floored! As volunteers we don\u2019t expect to be paid when we respond to an emergency, but we would like to know that it won\u2019t threaten our jobs. As an employer or manager, if you can\u2019t jump on a truck please support your employees who can. A more resilient community benefits us all. Being a good corporate citizen is good for business. This winter I drove the inland route through NSW to northern Queensland. Everywhere I looked I saw vigorous growth of grassland and forest understory, nurtured by good seasons, which my firefighter brain called \u201cfuel\u201d. This season won\u2019t be a repeat of 2019-20 but it won\u2019t be easy. Australia has always been a land of drought and flooding rain but climate change has amplified these extremes and to survive we need to develop resilience. That resilience will depend on a community of volunteers. \u2022 Dr Geoff Goldrick is a scientist, educator and volunteer firefighter", "\u2018Dark ages\u2019: Brisbane lord mayor pushes for Queensland to adopt daylight saving [2022-10-03T06:02:30Z]": "In Hervey Bay, Paul unwittingly switched on Sunday night\u2019s NRL grand final 60 minutes after kick-off. The game he was watching had a half to go but the result had already been decided. Paul was among those suffering after Queensland\u2019s reluctance to join much of the country in winding clocks forward an hour for the annual introduction of daylight saving. But the perennial debate has taken a turn, with Brisbane\u2019s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, calling for a daylight saving trial, revisiting an issue he championed back in February on the 30th anniversary of the state\u2019s failed referendum on making the change. It is a divisive issue which largely splits Queenslanders along geographic lines. Generally, rural and regional communities back the status quo that gives them light for early morning tasks and minimises work in the heat of the afternoon. But many in the south-east would relish extra sunlit evenings and find it easier to align with colleagues working in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  Alongside jokes around confused cows and hungry dogs, proponents for and against a change make scientific claims to back to their arguments, citing impacts on circadian rhythms, skin cancer rates and even road tolls for native wildlife. But on Sunday, Schrinner gathered an assortment of Brisbane\u2019s business and cultural figures to made an economic pitch for change. The mayor claimed not having daylight saving was costing Queenslanders $4bn in lost productivity every year, adding it would \u201cdeliver a bonanza for local businesses\u201d.   Related: Should we abolish daylight saving time \u2013 or apply it across Australia?     Without daylight saving, first light in Queensland can occur as early as 4.15am during the summer months. \u201cWho is spending money at the moment at 4.45am, not many people,\u201d Schrinner said. \u201cIf you shifted that opportunity to the evening, you will get massive lifestyle and economic benefits. We\u2019re letting good daylight hours go to waste.\u201d Queenslanders voted against permanently introducing daylight saving after a three-year trial back in 1992 \u2013 54.5% voted against daylight saving and 45.5% voted in favour. But Schrinner said most people under the age of 48 and anyone who moved to the state in the last 30 years hasn\u2019t had a say on adjusting time zones. It is not an argument that may win him many friends in the north or west of the state, where there is less variation in daylight hours as seasons change in the tropics. But for people like Loganlea\u2019s Brendon Woolf, it is a no-brainer. Woolf works remotely for a Melbourne-based company that helps NDIS participants look for specialist disability accommodation. He said the trend towards working from home and the fact that many were working for or with businesses in the southern states made it unnecessarily difficult to keep track of meetings. \u201cQueensland needs to come out of the dark ages,\u201d he said. \u201cThose old arguments about cows won\u2019t know what time milking is are very \u201870s or \u201880s kind of attitudes. We\u2019re in the 21st century now, it\u2019s time we moved forward.\u201d", "Hours on hold, repeated calls, months of delay: Maryanne\u2019s struggle to get urgent jobseeker payments [2023-08-06T15:00:14Z]": "When Maryanne Watts applied for jobseeker earlier this year, she knew it wouldn\u2019t be a smooth process. She had been a Centrelink worker in the 1990s and had received income support in recent years. But even she was shocked at how difficult it was to get her application processed \u2013 even when she was about to run out of money. Watts, 60, lives on acreage in rural Queensland about 110km from Bundaberg. Prior to Covid, she participated in Workforce Australia\u2019s small business assistance program while on jobseeker, working on an enterprise to help regional artists put their work online. When Covid hit, she accessed her superannuation early and dropped off income support. But within 18 months the super had run out, so she applied for jobseeker again.    Related: \u2018Slippery slope\u2019: how Australia\u2019s inadequate welfare traps single parents in a cycle of debt    \u201cThe first time it got held up was because they had asked for bank account details from the 23rd of February,\u201d Watts says. The earliest date on the bank statement she had provided was 9 March. \u201cI hadn\u2019t actually had any transactions between the 23rd and the ninth. But because the date of the 23rd wasn\u2019t on it, they didn\u2019t accept it. So I had to go further back.\u201d Watts only knew this tiny administrative technicality might have delayed her application because she called Centrelink to follow up on its progress. The Centrelink worker told her they had marked the application as urgent and said it would be processed as soon as possible, Watts says. Otherwise, she could be waiting for more than three months for her first payment.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  After another couple of weeks, she called again. This time, she was told to supply an extra mortgage statement. Despite its size, Watts\u2019 property is worth significantly less than the maximum allowed under the jobseeker assets test. Amid this, she had mortgage repayments looming at a time she couldn\u2019t afford the fuel to drive to the nearest town and back. \u201cEvery day, you try not to think about money, you try to get on with other stuff, whatever,\u201d Watts says. \u201cBut it\u2019s always there. It\u2019s this tension that\u2019s always in your body.\u201d Centrelink staff told her three times that they were marking her application for urgent processing due to financial hardship. There were text messages telling her that someone would get in contact with her about her application. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t,\u201d Watts says. She says a Centrelink worker later told her that despite what the text messages said, their policy was to wait for the applicant to call. Kristin O\u2019Connell, a spokesperson for the Antipoverty Centre, said Watts\u2019 experience was very common. \u201cWhat we know from people who have an urgent need for support is that it is nearly impossible to get through the Centrelink bureaucracy to get that support as quickly as you need it,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. \u201cThis is not an outlier situation.\u201d A key problem was understaffing of the call centres, O\u2019Connell says.   Related: More than 8,000 single parents to be moved on to jobseeker before Labor\u2019s welfare reform begins    Centrelink call waiting times have blown out over the past 12 months. Data tabled in Senate estimates in May showing that the number of \u201ccongestion messages\u201d on the Centrelink phone lines in the first nine months of this financial year had increased by 25% on last year\u2019s total. It rose from 5.59m congestion messages in 2021-22 to 6.99m as at 31 March this year. Call waiting times discouraged people from expediting their claims, fixing errors, getting help or clarification and ultimately from seeking income support at all, O\u2019Connell says. This was compounded by applicants\u2019 information being recorded incorrectly, vulnerability indicators not being marked on applications or not being heeded and recipients receiving contradicting advice from staff, including about whether they had provided all the necessary information. Watts says she spent at least an hour waiting on hold every time she called, which was at 8am \u2013 the minute the phone lines opened for the day. If she called any later, she received a congestion message. After six weeks of relentless following up, Watts\u2019 \u201curgent\u201d application was finally approved. For some people, though, the wait is vastly longer, with O\u2019Connell saying her own application for the disability support pension took 10 months of similar back and forth, as she followed up diligently every two weeks on her claim, only to be frequently told she needed to provide more information. \u201cBecause of all of the work I do supporting other people with this process, I know that I am not alone,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. Services Australia\u2019s spokesperson, Hank Jongen, said the majority of jobseeker claims were processed within two weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to those who are waiting longer. This is our busiest time of year with tax time and millions of families balancing their payments,\u201d Jongen said. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to Ms Watts and have extended the offer to work directly with her to ensure she\u2019s receiving all available support. \u201cWe\u2019re actively recruiting but our staffing is returning to more regular levels now that pandemic-era work and associated extra resourcing has concluded. We\u2019ve bolstered our emergency response capability with 850 staff directly supporting frontline service delivery. We\u2019re drawing from this to help meet current demands.\u201d The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, and the government services minister, Bill Shorten, have also been approached for comment.", "Saddler to supercharger: Tenterfield\u2019s Tesla site sparks local debate on EVs [2022-12-12T14:00:02Z]": "The network of electric vehicle (EV) \u2018supercharging\u2019 stations in rural New South Wales is expanding, with a multibay site about to open in the New England town immortalised in the Peter Allen song, Tenterfield Saddler. Yet high diesel costs, anti-renewables sentiment, EV affordability, and calls for more local parking in Tenterfield, all suggest the era of the country fuel stop isn\u2019t about to disappear quietly.   Related: Sale of hybrid cars double that of EVs in Australia with experts blaming lack of electric incentives    The uptake of EVs in rural Australia is projected to lag behind cities until at least 2050. But in October, the NSW state government announced $39.4m for Ampol, BP, Tesla, the NRMA and others to co-fund and build 86 \u201cfast and ultra-fast charging bays\u201d compatible with all EV types, many across the regions.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The new stations promise to be much faster than the current network of \u201cdestination chargers\u201d which have significantly longer recharge times than the 15 minutes claimed by the new 175-350kW superchargers. Tenterfield\u2019s first supercharger was installed by Tesla, which has further sites planned in Armidale and Muswellbrook, giving more options for EV drivers using the New England Highway. During the construction of the four-bay site in Tenterfield\u2019s shopping centre, debate raged on social media about its use of spaces in a 70-bay car park, fire risks of EVs \u2013 particularly batteries \u2013 and the need in a region of just 6800 residents. Tenterfield mayor Bronwyn Petrie, who published the initial post, acknowledges there has been a \u201cmixed reaction\u201d to the Tesla site, which she says didn\u2019t require council oversight as it was installed on privately owned land.    \u201cSome people support the electric vehicle charging and they realise it is an opportunity. Other people find it somewhat hypocritical that electric vehicles are being charged using a fossil fuel energy source.\u201d Petrie believes it\u2019s important to have fossil fuel and renewable energy, \u201cbut we have to be very honest in our approach to that and acknowledge the fact that the renewables are at present heavily subsidised and they do use a lot of non-renewable components\u201d. Energy minister Matt Kean\u2019s announcement about the funding for the superchargers stated that they will be fully powered by renewable energy. Calls for an end to fossil-fuel subsidies were resisted by many nations at Cop27 in November, including Australia. Although he believes \u201cclimate change is real\u201d, Simon Hicks, farmer and coalmine worker from Sandy Flat, south of Tenterfield, says he bought an EV because \u201cI was interested in the technology, not because I felt morally obliged to be saving the planet\u201d. He and husband, Greg May, bought a Kia EV6 in Armidale this year. The couple runs Donegal Farmstay, which had a destination charger for guests to recharge in about six hours. \u201cI\u2019ve since upgraded to another charger that talks to my solar system and basically skims off excess solar power rather than feeding it to the grid,\u201d Hicks says. During work trips to the Hunter valley, he relies on fast chargers at Scone, Tamworth, Armidale or Glen Innes to top up, using the waiting time for shopping trips. However, there\u2019s no backup if these single-bay chargers are not working.    Apps like Plugshare and A Better Route Planner (ABRP) allow Hicks to stay informed about the recharging network, particularly when drivers report which sites are occupied and functioning. He estimates the Tesla superchargers will be similar to those he uses in Queensland, which take about 20 minutes and cost 60 cents/kWh. \u201cWhen they put one in Armidale and they make the Tamworth one available for non-Tesla users, I\u2019ll probably be going there so that I can get my top-up a bit quicker.\u201d Hicks likes the idea that whether it\u2019s solar or wind power, \u201cor even coal in the meantime \u2026 I\u2019m powering the car from Australian resources\u201d. Tenterfield artist Luanna Legge has concerns about the lack of shade at the supercharger site, considering EV batteries carry an advisory for use in high temperatures, and the loss of parking. \u201cIt\u2019s detracting from the amenities we already had,\u201d she says. Despite her concerns about Tesla\u2019s monopoly in the marketplace, Legge says she isn\u2019t against renewables but is watchful of diminishing accessibility in the town\u2019s shopping centre, particularly for those with limited mobility. \u201c[The supercharger] might make Tenterfield more desirable for visitors, but it\u2019s ignoring the needs of people who live here all year round.\u201d   Related: Are electric vehicles about to become affordable? \u2013 with Lenore Taylor     Environmental credentials encouraged Tenterfield\u2019s Glenrock Gardens owners Chris and Annie Jones to buy a Tesla Model S for its long-distance reliability. \u201cThey\u2019ve continued to grow and support their vehicles,\u201d Chris says, adding that driving an EV in the country means being prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like if you\u2019re heading out west in a vehicle, you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019ve got the right bits and pieces to survive with flat tyres and spares and that sort of thing.\u201d He calls an occasional 20-minute recharging stop \u201ca minor inconvenience\u201d. \u201cI just think that having a charging station here is a real plus. \u201cIf people were coming this way and thinking, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got to charge up\u2019, they won\u2019t stop in Warwick or Stanthorpe or Glen Innes, they\u2019ll stop in Tenterfield.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Afternoon Update: Ita Buttrose to step down as ABC chair; Mark Latham quits One Nation; and Lachlan Murdoch pays $1.3m [2023-08-22T06:43:11Z]": "It is another afternoon of big names making news. \nIta Buttrose will not seek a second term as chair of the ABC when her role ends in March next year, Mark Latham quit One Nation to sit as an independent in the New South Wales parliament, and Fox Corporation chief Lachlan Murdoch paid Crikey $1.3m in legal costs over a dropped defamation suit. \nGlobally, Thursday is set to be a big day: Japan will begin releasing wastewater from a ruined Fukushima nuclear plan, and Donald Trump is expected to surrender to Fulton county authorities. \nTop news \n \n Donald Trump says he will surrender to authorities on Thursday | The former US president says he will surrender to Fulton county authorities in Georgia to face charges in the case accusing him of illegally scheming to overturn his 2020 election loss. \u201cCan you believe it?

Mary Crooks, who hails from country Victoria, is the executive director of the Trust and the architect of the Purple Sage project \u2013 the original model of \u201ckitchen table conversations\u201d that engaged regional voters and acted as a lightning rod for dissent ahead of Jeff Kennett\u2019s defeat in the 1999 state election. It went on to be used by independent political campaigns, including former Indi independent Cathy McGowan\u2019s 2013 victory as well as metropolitan independents such as Warringah MP Zali Steggall and the current crop of independent MPs elected in the 2022 federal election. \u201cWhen I first designed Purple Sage project in Victoria, way back in 1990s, the Victorian government at that time was riding roughshod over Victoria, and especially people in regional and rural Victoria,\u201d Crooks says.   Related: The rhetoric around the Indigenous voice to parliament shows it\u2019ll be a rough campaign    \u201cThat whole position of the National party this week, was redolent of that in my mind: \u2018You can stop right now, and pick up a ballot paper and fill it out because we know what\u2019s best for you. And if we\u2019re opposed to the voice, then you should be too.\u2019\u201d Now, the kitchen table model will be used across the nation in a project provisionally known as \u201cTogether, Yes\u201d. The concept would allow people to register for a process where they invite small groups into their homes for respectful conversations about the voice. \u201cMen and women on farming lands in regional hinterlands \u2013 they\u2019re not empty vessels waiting to be filled with political speak,\u201d Crooks says. \u201cThese are people who have lived rich lives and work hard. They have all the wisdom and experience in the world about a whole lot of stuff.    \u201cAnd so you want to provide an encouragement and a process whereby they can stop and have a think about this and apply their own wisdom and experience and filters to it and come up trumps, in terms of what they think they\u2019ll do \u2013 not to be told how to think.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Crooks has been in contact with campaign group From The Heart and other Indigenous leaders. The Victorian Women\u2019s Trust works side by side with Koorie Women Mean Business. They have been planning the strategy since the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, pledged to hold the referendum earlier this year. It is expected registrations for people interested in the kitchen table sessions will be open in February next year and run until June. \u2018The worst sort of opportunistic party politics\u2019 Australian history shows bipartisan support has been required on referendum, which need a majority of people in a majority of states. So the question this week was: if a rural based party like the Nationals opposes the voice, does it stand a chance?   Related: National party \u2018out of touch\u2019 with regional Australia on Indigenous voice, campaigner says    Essential polling conducted for Guardian Australia in August suggested there was majority support for the concept among rural and regional voters. This view was backed by Noel Pearson, who told ABC radio the Nationals MPs had been most supportive of the idea of the voice. Certainly the Nationals\u2019 decision sparked conversations in its own electorates.  It made three things clear in country Australia this week. First, the decision has energised engaged sections of National party electorates, particularly those targeted by centre-right independent campaigns.  Those electorates include Calare, where Nationals MP Andrew Gee revealed he was still a supporter of the voice, and Nicholls in Victoria, where newly elected Nationals MP Sam Birrell reserved his position. Birrell\u2019s independent opponent in the recent election, Rob Priestley, made his first Facebook post since the election on Thursday, with the hashtag #sufficientlypissedofftoreactivatefacebook. He wrote: \u201cSam Birrell MP, this issue is too serious to let the party play politics with it.\u201d \u201cTrying to kill the voice to parliament before we have even had the conversation is not coming to an informed position and deciding against it, it is the worst sort of opportunistic party politics. You are better than this.\u201d   Interactive   In nearby Euroa, resident Kate Auty said a loose coalition of local people had begun organising a series of education forums in the Strathbogies and surrounds to give people opportunities to talk about the voice and share any concerns. Second, there are a lot of assumptions made about the voting habits of rural electorates, including that most rural and regional people did not support marriage equality.   Related: Have the Nationals derailed the voice to parliament?    Only three of the 17 electorates that voted against marriage equality in the 2017 plebiscite were classed rural or provincial. They were all in Queensland. Of those, only one is a Nationals seat \u2013 David Littleproud\u2019s seat of Maranoa, where the yes vote was 43.9%. That plebiscite was a reminder that in spite of the teeth gnashing over whether rural and regional electorates would support what was seen as a \u201cprogressive\u201d issue like same-sex marriage, they did. Or at least, they didn\u2019t care about it enough to come out and vote no, given the high proportions in some seats \u2013 including up to 49% in Lingiari in the Northern Territory who did not bother voting. The third point to make about rural and regional areas is that, according to polling, most people don\u2019t even know about the referendum and if they do, they don\u2019t know the details. However, Crooks says from her conversations, there are plenty of groups getting energised across the country on the voice. \u201cMy advice to people is put your fingers in your ears for the moment and just wait for what are going to be a lot of special opportunities around the country, you know, with local government or faith communities or our own approach,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s a void but I don\u2019t think there is a void.

The latest annual Rental Affordability Index, released on Tuesday, shows more than 40% of low-income households are now in rental stress and struggling to find money to pay for food, heating and healthcare. The RAI is a key annual indicator of rental affordability relative to household income. If a tenant spends more than 30% of their income on rent, they are considered to be in housing stress. Regional areas have been the hardest hit by decreasing rental affordability, the report found, with Hobart continuing to be the least affordable city due to inadequate supply pushing prices above wages.   Related: Landlord demands 60% increase in rent from Brisbane tenant amid Queensland housing crisis    But each capital city has taken a blow. Rental affordability across Sydney has steadily fallen in the past year after moderate improvement during Covid lockdowns, and remained \u201ccritically unaffordable\u201d to a significant proportion of renters. The least affordable suburbs were Bondi, Darling Point and Vaucluse.   Interactive   Brisbane, for the first time, was considered \u201cmoderately unaffordable\u201d and Perth was at its lowest rental affordability rate since 2016. Melbourne, while experiencing a decline to pre-pandemic levels of affordability, was the most affordable capital city in Australia with average rental households having a gross income of $101,300.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The chief executive of National Shelter, Emma Greenhalgh, said those bearing the brunt of the rental crisis were people on low incomes and income support payments. Rental affordability remained poor for single people on jobseeker even during the Covid-19 supplement, the report found, with rising rents in capital cities continually outpacing the allowance and pushing recipients to the outer fringes of cities. Data shows 42% of low-income households are now in rental stress, compared with 35% in 2008. It comes as the jobseeker payment has fallen from $32,638 in 2020 to $21,320. For single pensioners, living in metropolitan areas would require 50% or more of income to be spent on rent in the majority of capital cities.   Related: A bitter winter and nowhere else to go: Hobart housing crisis forcing people to live in tents    \u201cHouseholds are having to make very, very tough decisions, to find accommodation elsewhere or bear the rent increase and cut back on expenses even further than what they are,\u201d Greenhalgh said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is adult children moving in with parents, overcrowding and households living in caravan parks \u2026 people at the frontline are telling us homelessness is the worst they\u2019ve seen it.\u201d Greenhalgh said low vacancy rates, interstate migration and global supply chain issues were contributing to escalating rental prices, however the pressure could be alleviated with further government support. \u201cWhat would make an immediate difference is increases to income support and commonwealth rent assistance \u2026 which at the moment is not alleviating rental stress. \u201cWe\u2019re asking the commonwealth to take leadership and develop a national rental reform framework \u2026 they\u2019ve come to the party with the National Housing Accord but we\u2019d like to see an escalation in that investment.\u201d Greenhalgh said traditionally, households would move further out to regional areas to secure affordable housing, but vacancy rates weren\u2019t keeping up with demand.

A healthy rate is 3-4% \u2026 it\u2019s incredibly low.\u201d The RAI report\u2019s lead author, Ellen Witte, said slightly falling rents during the pandemic were short lived, with rents now equal or higher rates to pre-2020 levels. \u201cThe pandemic \u2026 saw the existing rental crisis spread to the regions, when many households left capital cities,\u201d she said. \u201cKey workers are unable to access housing.\u201d Witte said floods in the New South Wales northern rivers region this year had a devastating impact on the housing sector, with low vacancy rates placing pressure on existing rental stock and new development. Lismore was one of the worst affected, where affordability plunged by 10% between 2021 and 2022. The town of Bellingen dropped by 14%. In Queensland, Gympie and Maryborough fell by 17% and 16% respectively. Witte said city dwellers migrating to the regions in a Covid-induced \u201ctree change\u201d had also compounded rental pressure outside urban areas. Net internal migration to the regions in March 2021 was about 50% higher than the historical peak.", "\u2018I was shocked\u2019: Catholic-run public hospitals refuse to provide birth control and abortion [2023-08-21T15:00:19Z]": "When Sarah*, a Melbourne mother, was pregnant with her second child, her GP gave her a surprising warning: if she had any serious complications, concerns about the viability of the pregnancy or believed she might be miscarrying, she should go to the Royal Women\u2019s hospital rather than the Mercy Hospital for Women, where she was planning to deliver the baby. \nThe reason, the GP told her, was that the Mercy \u2013 a public hospital in Melbourne\u2019s north-east \u2013 would not assist in terminating a pregnancy due to its Catholic affiliation. \n\u201cFurther along the pregnancy, when I was part of the midwife program, I asked one of the Mercy midwives and she confirmed it was against the Mercy\u2019s policy,\u201d Sarah says. \n\u201cI was kind of shocked. It\u2019s a public hospital and we\u2019re a secular country, so it didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d The midwife \u201cagreed it was a silly policy, but their hands were tied\u201d. Fortunately, Sarah delivered her baby in March without complications. \nLike a number of publicly funded Catholic hospitals around Australia, the Mercy\u2019s religious affiliation limits the scope of reproductive services it provides. \u201cSexual assault does not get seen at the Mercy specifically because they can\u2019t provide morning-after contraception,\u201d claims a senior gynaecologist who works in Melbourne and asked to remain anonymous. \nWomen who ask for a tubal ligation \u2013 a permanent contraceptive procedure that involves surgically blocking or clipping the fallopian tubes \u2013 after delivering via caesarean section will also usually have their request denied. \u201cThe trainees know that it\u2019s a Catholic hospital and that you can\u2019t tie tubes,\u201d the gynaecologist says. \u201cThat means that some of those women are being forced to get a second anaesthetic because they\u2019re having their tubes tied six months later at the [neighbouring] Austin hospital.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nPrior to the Covid pandemic, doctors worked around the religious constraints by walking women who wanted Implanon contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices (IUDs) down the corridor to have the procedures performed at the Austin. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling,\u201d says a doctor who works as an abortion provider in Melbourne. \u201cEvery time you have to use a loophole, it means that you\u2019re still creating stigma for the patient.\u201d Doctors say since the pandemic, some contraception is now being administered onsite at the Mercy. \nA spokesperson for Mercy Health said: \u201cPatients present to Mercy with any range of issues and situations, including sexual assault. Clinicians use clinical judgment, with reference to the Catholic Code of Ethics and established partnership arrangements with other public health services to ensure patients receive the comprehensive care they need.\u201d \nFollowing years of concerns about access to women\u2019s health services, a Senate inquiry into reproductive healthcare access tabled a report of recommendations in May. But doctors and family planning advocates say the inquiry has failed to tackle one of the most galling issues: publicly funded hospitals denying women basic reproductive healthcare. \n\u2018It\u2019s really stigmatising\u2019 \nThe Mercy is one of 15 Catholic public hospitals in Australia, at least five of which provide specialist maternity or gynaecology care. Despite public funding, multiple hospitals are bound by Catholic Health Australia\u2019s code of ethics, which prohibits birth control, IVF and abortions, even after rape. \nWomen who give birth in the public system are typically assigned to a health service according to their residential address, and this may be a Catholic hospital if they live in that catchment area. Many hospitals will not treat patients who fall out of the catchment zone, creating what some family planning workers describe as a postcode lottery for access to services. \nAt Brisbane\u2019s Mater hospital, which multiple experts described to Guardian Australia as the most advanced obstetric hospital in Queensland, doctors are unable to prescribe the pill or insert Mirena IUDs without obfuscating or fabricating their purpose. \n\u201cThe Mater will prescribe contraception for things like acne or heavy menstrual bleeding,\u201d says a doctor who has worked as an obstetrics registrar there. Contraception itself is not a permissible reason. \n\u201cI\u2019ve provided referrals to [abortion and contraception provider MSI Australia] for medical termination \u2026 It\u2019s at the discretion of the doctor. The speech I give is that this is a Catholic hospital and we don\u2019t do that, but here are some services that do.\u201d \n \n  \n  It was an alien concept to me to have religion involved in healthcare, which should be an evidence-based public provision \n   Dr Catriona Melville, MSI Australia \n   \n  \n \nAnother doctor, who trained in obstetrics at the Mater, recalls being told by a senior colleague when she asked about prescribing a patient an IUD: \u201cYou\u2019ll need to change or modify the reason for why you would give her a Mirena. \n\u201cHe did say we\u2019re not allowed to give the Mirena as a contraceptive. I just remember thinking that was really terrible. \n\u201cThey didn\u2019t offer tubal ligation basically for anyone. It\u2019s a public hospital and any other hospital would do that.\u201d \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nDaile Kelleher, the chief executive of Children by Choice, describes the lack of reproductive services at the Mater as \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d because of its status as one of the largest obstetrics and training hospitals in Queensland. \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s an issue and no one wants to do anything about it,\u201d she says. \nChildren by Choice offers Queensland-wide counselling services for pregnancy decision-making. Its counsellors dread hearing that someone lives south of the Brisbane River in the Mater\u2019s catchment area. \u201c[The counsellors] have supported people \u2026 to literally put someone else\u2019s address on their records so they can access something north of the river,\u201d Kelleher says. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard of people being turned away from the Mater \u2026 with suicidality and attempted self-abortion. If you look at the legislation in Queensland, even if there is conscientious objection, you can\u2019t turn someone away in an emergency. \n\u201cWe have people who have really wanted pregnancies who get exceptional care from the Mater, who have a foetal anomaly or fatal foetal diagnosis, and [then] they\u2019re basically told, \u2018Sorry, that\u2019s where our care ends and we can\u2019t continue to support you if you\u2019re going to be terminating this pregnancy.\u2019 \n\u201cIt\u2019s really stigmatising, it\u2019s really judgmental and it creates shame. It puts them out of the public system and into the private system \u2026 to access termination of pregnancy.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a reality gynaecologist Dr Catriona Melville, the MSI Australia deputy medical director, found \u201cshocking\u201d when she first moved from Scotland to Australia. \u201cI realised fairly quickly that there are religious hospitals \u2026 and that generally most of them will not provide the full gamut of sexual and reproductive health services. So contraception, abortion being the main ones, but obviously contraception for men as well, such as vasectomy.\u201cIt was an alien concept to me to have religion involved in healthcare, which should be an evidence-based public provision. It was a cultural shock for me as an internationally trained doctor, landing in Queensland as a reproductive health specialist.\u201dShe adds: \u201cWe have been contacted by medical staff from public hospitals who can\u2019t get advanced training in contraception.\u201d MSI has accommodated some of these doctors for observerships in its clinics. \nMelville says there are a variety of reasons people choose to work in large hospitals \u201ceven if they don\u2019t agree with the religious principles\u201d. \n\u201cDoctors do understand when they sign up that this is the framework they will be working under, which is extremely limiting for them, but obviously the person that suffers most is the patient,\u201d she says. \n\u201cIndividual clinicians treat people well, but their hands are tied.\u201d \nIn Queensland, there are additional concerns about reproductive health access because the Mater is contracted to run a flying obstetrics and gynaecology service in regional areas. It is also building a 174-bed public hospital in Springfield, south-west of Brisbane, which includes maternity services and to which Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s government has already pledged an initial $177m in funding. \nThe story is similar in other jurisdictions. In Perth, the St John of God Midland public hospital provides maternity care, \u201cbut of course people who require contraception before going home with their babies have to go elsewhere, which creates barriers to access\u201d, says Dr Alison Creagh, a sexual and reproductive health specialist in Western Australia. \n \n  Related: Positive birth stories exist and pregnant women deserve to hear them | Sophie Walker  \n \n\u201cAs you can imagine, having a new child makes it difficult to see another health service to get your contraception sorted,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really shocked that it was allowed to happen in the first place and I think that should be rectified as soon as that\u2019s possible. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an essential service, both to people wanting to access the service but also for the doctors who are wanting to train in comprehensive either gynaecology or primary care.\u201d \nIn the ACT, an inquiry into abortion services in April was critical of the Catholic-run Calvary public hospital\u2019s refusal to provide \u201cfull reproductive health services in accordance with human rights\u201d. One woman who had experienced an incomplete miscarriage was refused a dilation and curettage at Calvary because the procedure is also used for abortions, the inquiry heard. The inquiry report was updated in June to clarify that the woman was advised by her obstetrician that Calvary would not provide a D&amp;C because her condition was not an emergency. The update reflected that the evidence demonstrated community unease about what services Calvary may or may not provide, which would be resolved if the hospital provided \u201cfull reproductive health care\u201d. The ACT government has since acquired the hospital in a forced takeover. \n \n  Related: Unrecognised and underestimated: the fight to get Australian women proper care after miscarriages  \n \nA spokesperson for Catholic Health Australia said that \u201cCHA members are dedicated to making sure every woman entering its hospitals receives the care she needs\u201d. \n\u201cOur member hospitals respect a woman\u2019s right to make medical decisions in line with her own conscience. We understand these can be difficult decisions, involving difficult circumstances and time constraints, and pastoral care and counselling are available. \n\u201cIf a clinician at a CHA member hospital believes the continuation of a pregnancy poses a serious threat to the health or life of the mother, they will carry out the necessary interventions, consistent with the patient\u2019s wishes and consent.\u201d \n\u201cIf a clinician in a CHA member hospital makes the clinical judgment that the use of birth control is necessary for medical reasons, then the code of ethical standards supports them in that decision.\u201d \nThe Mater and St John of God Midland referred Guardian Australia to the statement made by CHA. \nUnlikely to change \nIn July the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, indicated the federal government was unlikely to go as far as requiring public hospitals to provide abortions in return for their funding. \nThat seems unlikely to change, given the Senate inquiry into reproductive healthcare access recommended in May that publicly funded hospitals only \u201cbe equipped\u201d to provide surgical pregnancy terminations. The inquiry\u2019s chair, the Greens senator Larissa Waters, says this is a problem. \n\u201cThey stopped short of making it a requirement for all hospitals receiving public funding, or requiring the commonwealth to fund the local affordable alternative service,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout fully funded referral pathways, people who cannot access a termination through their local hospital are at a significant disadvantage. And this will be felt even more acutely by people in rural and regional Australia and those without a Medicare card. \n\u201cAbortion care is basic healthcare and the Greens believe that means it should be available at any public hospital, with no out-of-pocket costs. However, patients don\u2019t care where they have to go to get an abortion, whether it\u2019s a hospital or a local private alternative, as long as it\u2019s free of charge, local and accessible. \n \n  Related: Home test that checks if an abortion has worked reduces follow-up surgery, study finds  \n \n\u201cGiven Labor has ruled out returning to its 2019 position of mandating hospitals provide abortion care as a condition of receiving taxpayer funding, we want to see a commitment to funding the \u2018timely, affordable and local pathways\u2019 to ensure people aren\u2019t falling through the cracks.\u201d \nMonash University reproductive care and abortion researcher Dr Shelly Makleff says the wording of the recommendation is \u201cdisappointing\u201d. \n\u201cI believe that in a taxpayer model, hospitals that receive taxpayer money should be obligated to provide care to anyone who walks in \u2013 and that means that they shouldn\u2019t be able to deny abortion care, tubal ligation, et cetera.\u201d \nOne submission to the inquiry, from obstetrician Dr Wendy Hughes, criticised Catholic hospitals for refusing \u201ctermination of pregnancy for any reason, including lethal foetal anomalies, despite taking taxpayer funds to set up maternofoetal units to diagnose these for the kudos but then \u2018outsourcing\u2019 the resultant terminations to secular hospitals\u201d. \nHughes also expressed concern about terminations being refused in urgent situations \u201cwhere mothers\u2019 lives are at stake and the outlook for the foetus is extremely dismal, such as midtrimester rupture of membranes with oligohydramnios, which is very high risk for developing chorioamnionitis and a cogent reason for termination to protect a mother\u2019s life\u201d. \nKelleher, of Children by Choice, says federal and state governments \u201cneed to tie public funding \u2026 to the delivery of the full suite of pregnancy outcomes\u201d. \n\u201cAll pregnancies have an outcome, whether that be miscarriage, stillbirth, birth or termination.

Dr Bronte Somerset\u2019s town of Quaama in the Bega Valley was engulfed by fire on New Years\u2019 Eve 2020. Although the home she shares with husband, Richard Parker, was saved \u201cby a whisker\u201d, their small insurance claim was not without its problems. \u201cDespite communication difficulties, the repairs were completed, eventually. It was a fraught time and perhaps people weren\u2019t as on-the-ball as they were before the fire,\u201d she says.   Related: Are the devastating floods a continuum in Australia? | Paul Daley    Accessing government and charitable assistance was problematic. The only help Somerset was able to access easily came from the NRMA, and a wheelbarrow donated by Anglicare which Somerset used in the cleanup until she was hospitalised. \u201cEverybody suffered in some way or another,\u201d she says. The couple moved to Quaama after being priced out of the Sydney market, and while housing was more affordable, insurance costs were already on the rise. They depend on income from providing thesis preparation services to supplement their pension. Somerset says she feels lucky to have work to help pay medical, car and house insurance. \u201cWe are in our 70s, but I can\u2019t see how we could ever fully retire.\u201d Many other Black Summer survivors on the south coast speak of the longer-term challenges that recent flood survivors are just starting to experience. Insurance is one of the common themes, whether residents were adequately covered, underinsured, or not insured at all. \u2018Never happen again\u2019    At Bundamba in south-east Queensland, mechanic Gavin Fletcher says his home and workshop flooded in 2011, something he believed local flood mapping indicated would never happen again. When his insurance rose to $36,000 a year, he had little choice but to let it lapse. In 2013 it did happen again, with flood waters lapping across the floor. According to Fletcher, Bureau of Meteorology warnings indicated this year\u2019s flood was supposed to peak at that 2013 level. Instead, his crowdfunding campaign shows mud-covered boxes upstairs, stacked above kitchen benches. \u201cThe loss would be in the hundreds of thousands,\u201d he says. Art director Helen Koker returned to Lismore, where she grew up, due to the high cost of housing in Sydney. She woke very early on 28 February with water halfway up the walls. Her $500 a week rental sits along the escape route from dangerous flood waters. She did not have insurance to cover her house and business contents, including equipment she uses for photo shoots and art direction.    \u201cAm I kicking myself? Of course I am. But I\u2019m a startup, I can\u2019t afford insurance,\u201d she says. Many people go without insurance because the cost is prohibitive, in part due to the taxes. In 2019, the year of the Black Summer fires, the cost of policies were driven up by stamp duty, GST and fire and rescue service levies. This year, there has been little mention of Treasury\u2019s broad-based insurance guarantee recommendation after the 2011 floods, meant to safeguard against skyrocketing premiums. The same National Disaster Insurance Review recommended that Centrelink customers, such as Helen Koker\u2019s brother Ian \u2013 who was eligible for assistance after joining her business during the pandemic \u2013 should be able to pay insurance policies off through their benefits. \u201cThat would make things so different,\u201d Koker says. \u201cWe had so many bookings coming up. Now, all we have is lost bookings. Every person is feeling alone and forgotten in Lismore.\u201d Priced out An Insurance Council spokesperson says national underinsurance rates \u201ccould be as high as 87.5%.\u201d This happens when assets are undervalued to make policies affordable, but it opens the possibility for residents to be considered as a co-insurer, assuming the risk for the uninsured portion of the property themselves. During the 2011 southern Queensland floods, the then prime minister Julia Gillard urged insurers to show compassion because 60% of homeowners did not have flood cover.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter      Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter   Flood coverage is now standard, but according to Jodi Bird from the consumer advocacy group Choice, the term \u201cflood\u201d mainly covers inland watercourses. \u201cStorm surge may be a primary feature of the current flooding event, particularly for coastal areas,\u201d Bird says. \u201cMany people have been priced out of flood insurance, so people in high-risk flood areas wouldn\u2019t be covered now.\u201d   Related: Thousands more to live on floodplain on Sydney\u2019s fringes if developments allowed to proceed    The Canstar database \u2013 which claims to be Australia\u2019s biggest financial comparison site \u2013 has no policies that cover flood from seawater or tides. Insurance premiums have become so expensive in parts of northern Australia that a $10b government guarantee has been introduced to cover cyclones. The solution may lie in policy reform. The NSW Greens MLC David Shoebridge has proposed basic bushfire cover through a universal insurance policy based on New Zealand\u2019s earthquake model. \u201cBut it is important to also ensure that this model doesn\u2019t facilitate new buildings in areas that should not be built on,\u201d he says. The Insurance Council\u2019s spokesperson says $2bn in prevention will save Australians $19bn by 2050, and that \u201call governments must do more to protect homes, businesses and communities from the impacts of extreme weather\u201d. Although the cyclone guarantee indicates reduction in insurance costs of up to 46% the same could be achieved by scrapping regressive taxes on insurance, a move which both the Insurance Industry Council and the ACCC said would increase coverage. Difficult talk    For Koker, as a young entrepreneur, the world of insurance is new. \u201cI am not from a moneyed background. I know nothing about insurance,\u201d she says. But Somerset says she can\u2019t imagine being uninsured. \u201cHow else can you protect yourself if you don\u2019t have access to that?

CoreLogic\u2019s latest regional market update found 10 regions registered modest value declines in the three months to July, with beach and country lifestyle areas the first to show market weakness after record-breaking rises during the pandemic. Regional growth slowed from a peak of 6.4% in December 2021 to 0.2% over the three months to July. But it came as dwelling values jumped 17% overall in the past year, outpacing combined capitals which experienced a 5.4% rise over the same period. The largest quarterly falls were in the Richmond-Tweed region, where house values dropped 4.5% , followed by Illawarra (down 3.5%) and southern highlands and Shoalhaven (down 3%). In Queensland, the Sunshine and Gold coasts fell by 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. At the same time, units in the Gold Coast recorded the highest annual increase in values, up by 23.7%, predominantly due to \u201caffordability\u201d. A median house value in the Gold Coast is $1.075m, about $400,000 more than the typical unit.

At the same time, rental stress in regional areas remains high. Of the 20 NSW suburbs listed as in \u201cdesperate need\u201d of rental supply, according to RentRabbit, 90% were in regional areas.

Once a traditional black-tie ball for single country people to drink and dance and maybe meet a partner, they\u2019re now regarded as \u201ca paddock party more than a B&amp;S ball\u201d where shirts are ripped, food dye is spat and attendees have the opportunity to \u201cwrite yourself off and have a really good night\u201d, according to Andrew Greenwood. Greenwood, 40, lives in Armidale in the New England region of New South Wales and estimates he\u2019s attended at least 100 B&amp;S balls, yet he\u2019s also witnessed a \u201chuge decline\u201d in their numbers.

As the manager of the B&amp;S Balls Australia Facebook Page, which collects historical information, promotes upcoming balls and supports their committees, Greenwood says the situation is getting worse as insurance costs climb \u201cthrough the roof\u201d and companies increase liability risks for BYO alcohol and camping events. \u201cWe understand they\u2019re trying to protect themselves but they\u2019re just not supporting local towns,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just putting too many rules and regulations in.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  A spokesperson for the Insurance Council of Australia says insurance is experiencing difficulties globally with capital more expensive and reinsurance harder to obtain.  \u201cThis is impacting the availability and affordability of public liability insurance in some markets, including the live entertainment industry and for some licensed venue operators,\u201d they say.    One of Australia\u2019s longest-running B&amp;S balls, Ariah Park in the NSW Riverina region, recently announced the cancellation of its 2022 event due to insurance costs.    I would hate to see that whole culture and history die off because of the licensing and the rules and regulations  Andrew Greenwood     Kitty Mitton, 25, has attended the Ariah Park B&amp;S Ball three times and says she was disappointed for committee organisers. The Dirranbandi, Queensland, resident says the majority of people who go to B&amp;S balls are responsible; they don\u2019t turn their car on or leave the keys in the ignition. \u201cBut then there\u2019s always that one dickhead in a ute that tries to do something funny and that\u2019s when something ends up happening.\u201d The first time Mitton attended one of Ariah Park\u2019s B&amp;S balls she was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d.  \u201cEveryone ends up looking like a smurf, because they\u2019re all just like spitting food dye on everyone,\u201d she says.    The committee president of Goondiwindi\u2019s upcoming Plucked Duck B&amp;S ball, Sam Jobling, says they\u2019re expecting 1,500 people to attend on 17 September after two years off due to Covid. \u201cThe amount of people it brings to town is incredible. We donate about $50,000 a year back into different organisations and charities,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of organisations that we give money to, and that\u2019s the only money they really get for the year.\u201d Although the committee was able to secure insurance for the 2022 Plucked Duck ball, Jobling predicts there\u2019ll be a point in the future when it will be too expensive. \u201cWe try our best to keep [ticket] prices down and reasonable but there\u2019s not much else we can do,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise we just wouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d The B&amp;S Balls Facebook Page recently posted a callout to all B&amp;S committees interested in insurance, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to come together nationally to share knowledge.\u201d Greenwood says he received a call from an insurer who offered to work with all B&amp;S committees \u201cto keep the ball scene going\u201d. Broker Brennan Edgar says he saw the Facebook post and wanted to help.    As a lifeline for all B&amp;S balls, Edgar says he hopes to unite committees and create a proposal to put to insurance companies. \u201cWe aim to get a solution which suits both the insurer from a risk management point of view but also something that is not so restrictive that will suffocate the balls and take the fun away,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also want a price that is sustainable for both the balls and the insurers.\u201d Greenwood acknowledges there have been quite a few serious accidents at B&amp;S balls, but doesn\u2019t want to see rural Australia lose this tradition.  \u201cI would hate to see that whole culture and history die off because of the licensing and the rules and regulations.\u201d Mitton said B&amp;S balls are \u201ca great socialising point \u2026 everyone should go to a B&amp;S once in their life\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s like a great stress release and it\u2019s just something to look forward to rather than just going to the pub on a Saturday.\u201d ", "\u2018I simply don\u2019t care\u2019: How my dreams of being a shopkeeper crashed and burned [2022-12-16T14:00:55Z]": "I thought I wanted to be a shopkeeper, but when I started hiding from anyone who walked into my shop, I realised this probably wasn\u2019t true. I had liked the idea of being a shopkeeper for so long and had poured thousands and thousands of dollars into shop stock, so it was not an ideal truth. But, eventually, I had to face it. Real shopkeepers don\u2019t hide behind counters. The issue was not the people I was hiding from (or \u201ccustomers\u201d as they are commonly known) \u2013 I just got to the point where I couldn\u2019t handle any new browser tabs in my brain being opened by strangers. Especially strangers who didn\u2019t buy anything. A little while ago I made an order at Bunnings and when I asked the man which phone number he needed from me for the receipt, he said, with an exhale: \u201cI simply don\u2019t care.\u201d This was the voice I started hearing in my head when a stranger in the shop began sharing unsolicited information about, well, where do I start? Local airstrip maintenance; their cousin\u2019s grandmother; mosaic artists. I ended up being Bad Bunnings Man. Worse were the times when someone would walk in with a backpack, plonk it gently on the counter and pull out bowls they had painted. Or coasters they had made. One by one. To see if I might want to sell them. Mostly, I did not want to sell them. But I know what it\u2019s like to show someone your work. So I started hiding.    I had longed to be a shopkeeper all my life. But I only started talking about it out loud a year ago, under the guise of my business. I\u2019ve been running Galah magazine from a laptop in my kitchen on a pecan farm, an hour out of Tenterfield on the NSW-Queensland border. That is to say, not near anyone. This has worked very well. Then Wendy, who is in charge of mailing out the magazines, said she needed her dining table back. So I started looking to rent a shed space in town.   Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  The space I found had a freshly painted, light and airy shopfront attached. I had all sorts of ways to justify the shop idea. \u201cAny modern media business needs multiple revenue streams\u201d is a line I dished out a lot. I\u2019d also talk about synergies between the shop and the magazine dispatch. But really, I just wanted to be a shopkeeper. Friends gently warned me that running a shop was a lot of work and that it might be too much on top of what I already had. My mother, more pointedly, said my children were already being raised by wolves. But I dismissed all that because finally I had a semi-plausible excuse to live out my shop dreams. Why an introvert wanted to open a bricks and mortar shop is a question I need to ask a therapist. But until then, my armchair origin story is threefold. My mother was a big shopper and as a child I spent hours hanging out on sofas in boutiques while mum tried on clothes. I loved the calm, controlled, artificial atmosphere of the shops, where everyone had clearly defined roles and where my sister and I felt like the only children in the world. Fast forward 20 years, when I was newly married with my first child. I had just moved from Sydney to Moree and didn\u2019t know many people. I\u2019d walk into shops looking for a chat. The shopkeepers were always funny, sharp, creative women. They\u2019d make me feel less alone by talking to me. They were also surrounded by beautiful art or clothes or flowers. They were proof that other people cared about beauty and gentle things in what was, on the surface, quite a macho agricultural place. Shops, especially in small towns, can provide a service that goes way beyond selling stuff.    Finally, I blame writer Ann Patchett. Specifically the way she talks about Parnassus, the independent bookstore she co-owns in Nashville, which she credits for doing more good on behalf of culture than all her novels. \u201cI\u2019ve made a place in my community where everyone is welcome,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe have story time and poetry readings and demonstrations from cookbooks. I\u2019ve interviewed more authors than you could even imagine. Many of them sleep at my house. I promote the books I love tirelessly, because a book can so easily get lost in the mad shuffle of the world and it needs someone with a loud voice to hold it up and praise it. I am that person.\u201d I wanted to be that person. Or one of those people. And so I opened a shop. But instead of welcoming the community open-armed, I found myself crouching behind furniture. Former Google brain Mo Gawdat came up with a happiness equation that could be interpreted thus: \u201cif you want to be happy, have low expectations\u201d. Given I thought the shop could be the champion of all regional artists, as well as a cure for new-to-town loneliness with a whiff of motherly love, it\u2019s fair to say it was doomed from the start. And then there was the problem of the people walking in. So many interruptions that I thought I would love, but that I did not. I have since asked other shopkeepers how they do it. One texted GIN in capital letters. Another said \u201cthere is no room for creativity when you\u2019re making conversation all day\u201d. So I thought I wanted to be the shopkeeper, but I just wanted to be in the shop. For a small amount of time when it suited me. I wanted to be a shopper.

To the electricity transmission network operator Transgrid, it\u2019s less than $800,000. Their property beside the Blowering Reservoir in southern New South Wales is a uniquely Australian sight. Big brushstrokes of wattle creep up the ridge, clumps of yellow sitting between burnt-out gums \u2013 a legacy of the black summer bushfires of 2019-20. The Sturgess farm, where they run cattle and harvest eucalyptus oil, has been in Paul\u2019s family since the 1950s. There were two electricity connections through it when he inherited it. He and Andrea don\u2019t want any more. \u201cThese lines went in in the 70s and I\u2019ve lived with them ever since,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not a day goes by that the lines don\u2019t affect me somehow. \u201cEither I see them or I hear them or I\u2019m trying to do something in the paddock, plough a paddock, move the cattle, and those lines are in the road.\u201d    The Sturgesses are part of an increasingly agitated argument over how Australia will embrace the clean energy needed to respond to the climate crisis and what that means for its natural landscape. The federal government has set a goal of 82% of electricity coming from renewable energy by 2030, up from about 35% today. This transformation, replacing ageing and failing coal plants with solar and windfarms and back-up energy storage, is necessary to meet its climate targets and set up Australia for a zero emissions future.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Its path to get there is based on advice from the Australian Energy Market Operator, which has laid out a blueprint involving a series of major new electricity connections between the five eastern states. The operator estimates the country needs more than 10,000km of new transmission lines and a ninefold increase in large-scale wind and solar energy.    We don\u2019t want to sound like whinging friggin\u2019 farmers, but it\u2019s our life  Harry Lucas     To achieve this, the federal government has committed $20bn in low-cost finance for \u201crewiring the nation\u201d. State governments in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have announced their own renewable energy targets, including carving out new zones for development that have to be connected to the power grid. It is a huge collective undertaking being managed by a mix of national and state electricity agencies and business. At the moment, the rewiring and renewable energy rollout is struggling. Analyses suggest the pace of construction and connection will need to at least double if the country is to get near the 2030 target, and political debate has turned to whether the life of some coal plants should be extended.  There are also pockets of opposition to the rewiring project that extend beyond traditional renewable energy blockers in the federal Nationals party room. Issues raised include concern about a lack of effective community consultation during planning, confusion over inconsistent compensation arrangements and questions about how best to limit the impact on farming land and nature.   Related: Future uncertain for key Tasmania to mainland power transmission link after $2bn cost blowout    Overground v underground The Sturgesses are particularly worried about increasing fire risk. Damage from the 2019-20 fires sits like a black blanket across all sides of the hill on the property \u2013 a reminder of the impact of extreme events exacerbated by the current reliance on fossil fuels. Paul points west to where the sun will soon be setting and remembers how he and Andrea watched as a fireball jumped 3km and landed on the transmission lines, which within minutes had carried the blaze 20km. \u201cIt came straight up that line, just like a funnel,\u201d he says.   Interactive   The Sturgesses\u2019 property is on the proposed path for HumeLink, a 360km connection between the planned Snowy 2.0 expansion in the Mount Kosciuszko national park to Bannaby, north-west of Goulburn. They are strongly opposed, believing it would put them at greater risk, and have joined a campaign for the lines to be buried \u2013 a proposal that is the focus of a state parliamentary inquiry. \u201cIf they are underground, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Paul says.    The Sturgesses are part of an alliance of about 160 NSW farmers opposing the power lines and refusing to allow Transgrid access to their properties. It\u2019s a standoff that could lead to compulsory acquisition, in which they would be forced to host the infrastructure. Transgrid says overhead transmission is the quickest and cheapest way to deliver what is needed. The state government is offering compensation \u2013 a set amount that landholders have been told not to reveal, plus $200,000 per kilometre of line. It is a similar story in other states \u2013 $200,000 a kilometre in Victoria and $300,000 in Queensland. But this has not been enough to sway some opponents. Landholders say the lines will make it harder to farm, devalue properties, disrupt views and destroy ecosystems. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the $200,000,\u201d Andrea Sturgess says. \u201cPut it into undergrounding.\u201d    Farther north, about 14km from Tumut, the Lucas family \u2013 Harry and Jan, and their daughter Jessie Reynolds \u2013 are refusing to allow Transgrid on their land despite being offered $1m. Reynolds says: \u201cThere\u2019s not a monetary figure on this place. It\u2019s a family farm.\u201d The Lucas property is sheltered by the Snowy Mountains. It backs on to a national park and sits at the bottom of a valley so picturesque it was recently used as the backdrop for a car advertisement. Harry Lucas says it\u2019s the best land in the country. He worries about the loss of hundreds of trees they have planted over generations, and that the transmission lines would stop them being able to fertilise their property evenly by plane.    \u201cWe don\u2019t want to sound like whinging friggin\u2019 farmers, but it\u2019s our life,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re just industrialising fertile rural farming land \u2013 the most fertile land in Australia.\u201d The family also objects to how Transgrid has handled the consultation. Jan Lucas says they have been told to take the money or they won\u2019t get anything. Her daughter says: \u201cIt\u2019s bully tactics \u2026 You can\u2019t talk to your neighbour about what you\u2019re getting paid. \u201cThey say \u2018the nextdoor neighbour is fine with it\u2019, but you don\u2019t know. It\u2019s divide and conquer.\u201d Concern over HumeLink is not restricted to the impact on farming. Jess Campbell, the chair of the Riverina Highlands Landcare Network, says the proposed route would affect critically endangered and threatened species, including the Macquarie perch, the Booroolong frog and the box-gum grassy woodland. She says the latter is home to 14 rare birds, including the hooded robin and diamond firetail. Some small woodland birds will not fly more than 50 metres in the open for fear of predators, and the wide easements required for powerlines risk confining threatened species to small habitats that are unviable for their long-term survival, Campbell says.     Related: Australia risks failing on renewable energy \u2013 but two steps could help fix that | Adam Morton    \u201cWe\u2019re all for renewables, but you\u2019re sacrificing the environment for the environment,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be some balancing, as opposed to just going to the most cost-effective format.\u201d Like the Sturgesses and Lucases, Campbell says going underground would be a better option. \u201cObviously, underground and overground both have an impact on the environment,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to dig underground so you are going to clear the land still, but the impact is minimised and then able to be recovered.\u201d  Transgrid hopes to finish HumeLink by mid-2026.  A company spokesperson said it had been engaging with the community since early this year, including sending information packs to landowners who may be affected, holding information sessions and extending the consultation period after receiving feedback. \u201cWe encourage everybody with an interest in the project to attend a community information day to ask questions of the project team and have their say by lodging a submission.\u201d The spokesperson said the proposed transmission links were \u201cactionable projects\u201d in the government\u2019s plan and were urgently needed to ensure the power grid remained secure as ageing coal plants retired. They said putting transmission lines underground would double the cost, at a minimum, and delay the projects by several years. \u2018They\u2019re buggering up my world\u2019 In Victoria, a similar fight is under way, centred on whether the proposed 800km VNI West interconnector, a planned link between Victoria and New South Wales, is the best way ahead. On Tuesday, a line of dozens of tractors were part of a protest outside state parliament in Melbourne objecting to the route running through their properties. Some of them argued for an alternative plan proposed by the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, which supports using existing transmission links to connect to new offshore windfarms and greater battery storage, rather than interstate transmission lines. The Australian Energy Market Operator, which manages the national grid, has rejected the proposal, saying it would not provide what was needed to all parts of the state, particularly the north-west, would require the demolition of people\u2019s homes to widen the existing transmission path, and would threaten the power supply to towns during construction. The Victorian energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, says VNI West will unlock 3.4 gigawatts of the new renewable generation needed in the state, citing Aemo\u2019s analysis. Farmers at parliament said they felt unheard, and were concerned about the impact on their properties.    Tom Drife, a farmer at Glendaruel, north of Ballarat, says his newly built home will look out on to the interconnector, and banks have estimated the lines will shave $1.4m off the value of his property. He stores 30,000 tonnes of grain on his property as part of a share-farming business, and worries the lines will increase fire risk and make the place uninsurable. \u201cOur insurance man said at the minute we\u2019re happy insuring you, you don\u2019t have the power lines, but it will basically come down to risk assessment,\u201d Drife says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get insurance, we can\u2019t even run that part of our business.\u201d Closer to Melbourne, Barb and Glenn Ford say the transmission lines for the western renewable link will intrude on their farm near Melton, which is already being slowly surrounded by the city. Barb Ford says it will make it more difficult to spray fertiliser and operate large machinery. \u201cWe\u2019re not far from the substation and to get to where they\u2019re going they\u2019ve actually had to diagonally cut right through the middle of our 800-acre property,\u201d Barb Ford says. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a fairly significant impact for us.\u201d Glenn Ford says if people want overhead lines on their property \u201clet them go ahead \u2026 But they\u2019re buggering up my world.\u201d \u2018No simple solutions\u2019 For Narromine cotton and wheat farmer Karin Stark, who is also a renewables consultant, the problem that all this is trying to address \u2013 the climate crisis \u2013 is an everyday reality. She hasn\u2019t had a crop in 18 months. \u201cFarmers are already seeing those climatic impacts on their properties. It\u2019s not a future thing any more,\u201d she says. Stark is taking the solution into her own hands, working on a project with the Energy Charter, an organisation made up of energy chief executives looking at the viability of undergrounding power lines.    But she says part of the problem is that no one knows how expensive it would be. There has been no clear communication about why building transmission lines over people\u2019s heads was a better option, she says. \u201cWe need renewables, and that large scale [that is being built] is going to get us the pace and scale that we need to keep the lights on,\u201d she says. \u201c[But] the outcome has to be best for the communities and the region\u2019s environment.\u201d Energy analysts believe governments to rethink their approach, warning the country will otherwise miss its renewable energy target. Dylan McConnell, a renewable energy and energy systems analyst at the University of New South Wales, says the argument over energy infrastructure has become \u201cincredibly challenging and fraught\u201d with \u201cnot a lot of space for nuance\u201d. He suggests policymakers take a risk management approach that keeps other options \u2013 including more small and large-scale energy storage \u2013 open, and acknowledges the social and regulatory barriers facing some transmission projects. He says cost blowouts have made the viability of some developments \u2013 such as the Marinus Link between Victoria and Tasmania \u2013 questionable. \u201cIt can be simultaneously true that we need transmission, but we don\u2019t need some of the projects that have been proposed,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no simple solutions.\u201d McConnell says the country needs more policy to drive rapid construction of solar and wind and faster closure of coal plants. Tony Wood, the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan Institute, agrees. He says federal and state governments need to agree on how to encourage investment in clean energy and the firm generation needed to back it up, and suggests the best idea could be to extend the safeguard mechanism \u2013 a policy to cut pollution at industrial sites \u2013 to power plants. And he says there should be a recognition that the $20bn dedicated to rewiring the nation can not deliver what is needed on transmission on its own because the main barriers are planning and regulation, not low-cost finance. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is not going to get us there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need a fundamental change in the way we\u2019re doing it and that won\u2019t come without pain.\u201d", "Increased funding has left private schools better able to attract teachers, public principals say [2023-07-18T15:00:24Z]": "Increases in funding to the private education system have enabled it to attract teachers, despite a nationwide shortage, due to its ability to bump up salaries, according to the head of the New South Wales Secondary Principals\u2019 Council. Craig Petersen, who represents the principals of public schools across the state, said not only do public schools not have the budget to compete, but they were also restricted from lifting teachers\u2019 salaries above the award wage. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to fill a position at your nongovernment school, you can offer five to 10 to $20,000 bonuses, and you can provide other perks for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for someone to knock back that opportunity.\u201d   Related: The parents fleeing Australia\u2019s public school system \u2013 and those choosing to stay    It comes as Guardian Australia revealed funding to independent and Catholic schools has increased almost twice as much compared with public schools in the decade since the landmark Gonski review, which set out a roadmap to fund schools according to their need. Petersen said teachers were also struggling under the strain of a public school system underfunded to deliver to the needs of its students. \u201cOur classrooms are incredibly complex because of the diversity, because we\u2019re not adequately funded, and because we never got those final years of the additional Gonski funding,\u201d he said. The president of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, agreed the consequences of the funding increase divide between public and private schools was playing out in the hot competition for teachers.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  He pointed to the principal of Sceggs Darlinghurst, an independent school in Sydney, saying at the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s schools summit earlier this year that the school paid \u201ctop of the scale\u201d teachers $135,000. The top bracket in the public education system is currently $117,060. \u201cThe answer to this lies in governments fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure every classroom has a qualified teacher, and that must be through competitive salaries and manageable workloads,\u201d he said. Graham Catt, the chief executive of Independent Schools Australia, said the 1,200 independent schools across Australia had vastly different resourcing and operational capabilities, with some likely being in a better position to attract and retain teachers than others. For other independent schools which are focused on providing the lowest fees possible for parents, he said they would struggle to find the revenue to provide teachers an additional pay rise. \u201cThe workforce issues is across every sector, and I think it\u2019s by working together and through the review of the [National School Reform Agreement] that we have our best chance of solving that,\u201d Catt said. Petersen said the finding that public school funding had not increased as much as private schools was an \u201cenormous disappointment\u201d, but he was not surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to me because this is exactly what we\u2019ve been warning against for well over a decade,\u201d he said. Patrick Murphy, the president of the Queensland Association of State School Principals, said he was also seeing a downgrading of facilities across the state\u2019s public schools, from the loss of art and music programs, to sport and language.   Related: Why Australian schools fail those most in need \u2013 podcast    \u201cThose programs get dropped because they can\u2019t afford the teachers, where others can,\u201d he said. But it also meant schools have limited ability to provide other crucial staffing resources which can help build a child\u2019s learning capability for the rest of their lives, such as psychologists, occupational therapists and speech pathologists. He said this was a resource most critical in schools located in rural and remote areas where these services were limited compared with metro areas. Murphy said he was also seeing the consequences of state governments not reaching their obligation to fund public schools at 80%. \u201cThe disappointing fact is the Queensland government has not lifted from 89.6% of the school resourcing standard for students in Queensland,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Naplan results are not moving, we shouldn\u2019t be blaming schools, we should be blaming a system that underinvests.\u201d", "Guardian Australia picks up seven Walkley award nominations  [2023-10-12T10:57:38Z]": "Guardian Australia has picked up seven nominations in the 68th annual Walkley awards for excellence in journalism.

Dylan Bird from the Bureau of Meteorology said that from Friday until Monday, large parts of NSW would experience temperatures 10-14C above average, possibly peaking at 30C in Sydney. The warm weather is being caused by a high-pressure system over south-east Australia with northerly winds pushing warm air south-eastwards from Queensland and central Australia.   Related: Sydney\u2019s urban fringe braces for hot, dry summer as firefighters warn over bushfire risks    \u201cIt\u2019s the first real warmth since last warm season,\u201d Bird said. \u201cWe will get a front or a trough to clear the heat eventually, but not until Tuesday or Wednesday next week.\u201d Sydney Marathon runners will take on the unseasonal heat as well as 42.195km on Sunday. About 40,000 runners are expected to compete across multiple events, with the full marathon drawing more than 14,000 runners. Weatherzone predicted marathon start-time temperatures of 17-19C, rising to 28C by the close of race. Average temperatures for the month of the event range from 11C to a high of 20C. Smoke from hazard reduction burns in the Sydney area and the predicted warm weather were both on marathon organisers\u2019 minds on Tuesday. In a statement, the Sydney Marathon race director, Wayne Larden, said organisers were working with the Rural Fire Service and the BoM ahead of Sunday\u2019s race. \u201cSydney Marathon has taken several precautionary steps, including increasing the availability of hydration capacity and medical assistance points along the course. This is in addition to the existing rigorous safety protocols and medical support available on course,\u201d he said. He said the RFS was working to minimise the impact on the Sydney Marathon. A high of 27.9C was recorded on marathon day in 2019 \u2013 while the year before, in 2018, the marathon took place on a day that reached just 17.4C, according to BoM charts. The bureau has not yet declared an El Ni\u00f1o for the summer ahead, but Bird said the agency was observing climate criteria closely and that the phenomenon, now given a 70% chance of emerging, was \u201cvery likely\u201d. It forecasts a hotter, drier summer for much of Australia, owing to the likely El Ni\u00f1o and the Indian Ocean Dipole development. Sydney residents have been told to prepare for a high risk of bushfires this summer, while prolific vegetation growth has added to fuel loads as bushfire season approaches.", "\u2018We\u2019re not a priority\u2019: people with disabilities wait up to three hours for transport in regional Queensland [2022-04-20T17:30:32Z]": "Living in regional Queensland, David Conway sometimes waits up to three hours for a taxi to arrive. He says there are so few wheelchair-accessible taxis in Mackay that no matter how far he plans ahead, he can never rely on them to arrive on time \u2013 or at all. This week, Conway missed an urgent medical appointment after waiting almost an hour for a taxi to arrive, before finally cancelling the trip. \u201cI have endocrine issues and I need to do a blood test within the next two weeks so my specialist can make sure my medication is right,\u201d Conway says. \u201cBut it feels like people in wheelchairs are an afterthought. We\u2019re not a priority.\u201d Conway is vision impaired and paraplegic. He says drivers operating taxis don\u2019t always have the appropriate training, putting passengers with disabilities at risk. \u201cI\u2019ve had one driver not strap me in properly \u2026 and slam on the brakes to avoid collision,\u201d he says. \u201cI fell out of my chair, smashed my head and was bleeding through my nose and face. My GP said it was a miracle that \u2026 I didn\u2019t break my jaw, nose or cheekbones, with the extreme bruising that I had.\u201d But Conway says catching public transport can also be a gruelling experience. Not only are buses infrequent in his area but \u2013 unlike wheelchair-accessible taxis \u2013 they have no safety straps to keep passengers secure. This means passengers rely solely on the brakes of their wheelchair and upper body strength to stay still. \u201cYou want to hope the driver takes it easy on corners but that doesn\u2019t always happen. If they go around like Fast and Furious, I might slide forward as well,\u201d he says. Chair of the Queenslanders with Disability Network (QDN), Des Ryan, says it\u2019s common for people with disabilities to wait one to three hours for an accessible taxi to show up \u2013 particularly in regional areas. \u201cSometimes there are just no accessible taxis working or available due to low numbers,\u201d Ryan tells Guardian Australia. \u201cQDN members have reported that in regional areas the situation is worse, with not enough accessible taxis to service the needs of the local population with disability \u2013 especially in growth areas like Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and Mackay.\u201d   Related: Advocates say people with disability are increasingly \u2018forgotten\u2019 in emergency planning    Ryan says many people with disabilities don\u2019t live close to public transport, meaning getting to the station or bus can be an extra challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t think people could imagine the amount of planning that people with disability have to do to get to doctor\u2019s appointments, get our groceries, or get to work,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you have to depend on others when striving for independence.\u201d While the situation might be tougher for people with disabilities in regional areas, citysiders aren\u2019t immune to these issues. Elisha Matthews lives in Hamilton, in north-east Brisbane, and says it\u2019s nearly impossible to book an accessible taxi between 3pm and 5pm. She says this is because most wheelchair-accessible taxis are contracted to do school runs for children with disabilities. \u201cI have full-time care of my seven-year-old granddaughter, and TransLink recently removed the bus route that went from my home to her school,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cBecause [most taxis] are not available at 3pm, it\u2019s a very difficult task. \u201cI\u2019ve had to make a permanent booking with the after-school care service, just in case I cannot pick her up on time.\u201d Matthews lives with a neurological condition and autoimmune disease, which affects her mobility and causes her pain and fatigue. She says she waits an average of 30 minutes for taxis to accept her booking, and they often take another half an hour to arrive. The longest she\u2019s waited for a taxi to arrive has been two and a half hours. \u201cI really feel like I\u2019m a burden to not only the taxi service, but the community,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cThey seem to think we can just wait. But I\u2019ve still got children to pick up from school and feed \u2013 I\u2019ve still got a job to go to.\u201d Matthews says she\u2019s also experienced inappropriate behaviour from taxi drivers, including ableist comments and drivers turning on the meter before she gets inside the vehicle.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   She says this is despite her having a taxi subsidy where the Queensland government pays drivers a $20 \u201clift payment\u201d to load and unload eligible passengers into vehicles. \u201cI argued once and the driver got very aggressive, and I did fear for my safety. I decided after that it was safer for me to not argue,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cWe\u2019re very vulnerable, and drivers identify that and think they can get away with it.\u201d The state\u2019s Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) said the government launched a wheelchair-accessible taxi scheme in 2019 by funding half the cost of a vehicle. \u201cTMR does not regulate wait times for taxis in Queensland, which are a commercial responsibility for taxi operators to manage in meeting their customers\u2019 needs,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. \u201cThe driver of a taxi available for hire must not refuse to provide a taxi service to any person, or a booked hire service to a person in a wheelchair or to a member of the taxi subsidy scheme, unless they have a reasonable excuse.\u201d Ryan says while the Queensland government has \u201cdone a lot to rectify the situation\u201d, there\u2019s still progress to be made. He says this includes working with the taxi industry to review accessibility against demand. \u201cBeing able to travel freely and grab a taxi is something that most Australians take for granted but that is not the experience for many people with disability,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cWe need to continue to work on this and improve access for all.\u201d", "MP Kate Chaney launches bid to overturn ban on accessing assisted dying appointments via telehealth [2023-11-13T23:06:44Z]": " The independent MP Kate Chaney will push to amend federal laws that ban telecommunications services from being used to incite suicide, so that patients wishing to access voluntary assisted dying appointments can do so via telehealth. Federal legislation prevents anyone seeking information or advice about voluntary assisted dying from a health professional over an electronic carriage service, ruling out telehealth consults for assistance.   Related: \u2018It was cruel\u2019: dying patient denied euthanasia in Catholic-run hospital    Doctors and advocates for voluntary assisted dying have long been calling for changes to the law, saying it makes it difficult for patients who live in rural and remote areas, and those whose conditions limit their movement or make travel painful, to attend appointments. It follows reporting from Guardian Australia that disparities between state and federal laws add delays to patients obtaining approval for voluntary assisted dying, which is particularly problematic for those with health conditions leading to rapid decline, and who want to die at home.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  While state laws differ, generally, patients must make at least three requests for access to voluntary assisted dying to their doctor, and be assessed at least twice by medical professionals. Doctors require these appointments to be in person so that they do not breach federal laws. Chaney will introduce a bill in the new year exempting voluntary assisted dying appointments from the federal criminal code \u2013 making it easier for those in states with voluntary assisted dying legislation to access care. \u201cThis is such a simple ask \u2013 that we update the federal criminal code to allow people in remote areas to access the same end-of-life health services as everyone else, via telehealth,\u201d Chaney said.   Related: What are the laws on voluntary assisted dying in each state?    \u201cThis small amendment will remove any ambiguity and allow doctors to administer end-of-life services without fear of prosecution under an outdated law. It\u2019s time to update our laws in line with community expectations, so that access to dignified end-of-life services doesn\u2019t depend on your postcode.\u201d The move is being supported by fellow independent MP and former neurologist Monique Ryan. \u201cThe level of medical care needed to support voluntary assisted dying patients is challenging and requires care and commitment,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cFew clinicians have the skills required.

The latest data from the Regional Australia Institute shows that there were 84,600 regional job vacancies in April 2022 \u2013 up nearly a quarter (24.8%) compared to a year earlier. CEO of the RAI, Liz Ritchie, said the numbers continue a trend over recent years of month-on-month record job vacancy growth far exceeding the peaks of the mining boom in 2011, where vacancies were about 60,000.   Related: What will the new Labor government do for rural and regional Australia?    Ritchie said professional roles in health, legal and engineering services are consistently at the top of the vacancies lists. She said the vacancies represented a real opportunity cost at a time when \u201cbusinesses are wanting to grow and wanting to scale and that there is optimism and confidence across regional Australia\u201d. Outback Queensland\u2019s vacancies shot up by 59.1% in April 2022 compared with April 2021, while the region also had the highest unemployment rate of 14.6%. The area is part of the electorate of new National party leader, David Littleproud. Mark Collins, chair of the Ag Business Committee for Ag Force, Queensland\u2019s peak body for agriculture, said he was not surprised by the figures as the lack of employees with the right skills was a big issue. Collins blamed the shortfall of skilled workers in regional Queensland on the state government\u2019s closure of agricultural colleges at Longreach and Emerald in 2019, and at Dolby and Burdekin nearly a decade ago. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to train young people for a future in agriculture,\u201d Collins said. He said the vacancies affect production, but also rippled through the whole supply chain.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        \u201cAt a farm level, that\u2019s a problem, and then you can\u2019t find truck drivers with good enough skills to take our cattle to be processed \u2026 and then at that next level at a meatworks or even at a grain handling facility, they can\u2019t find anyone,\u201d Collins said. The new federal Labor government has promised to establish Jobs and Skills Australia as a national partnership to drive vocational education and training and strengthen workforce planning, in addition to creating 465,000 new fee-free TAFE places in areas of demonstrated labour shortage. Ritchie said Queensland\u2019s unemployment and vacancy figures showed that skills needed to be aligned with the work available. However she said it\u2019s important to note that outback Queensland was one of the smallest areas in terms of actual job numbers, which can result in more significant percentage shifts. Other regions with big jumps in job vacancies were Geelong &amp; Surf Coast (54%), Sunshine Coast (38.9%), Central Queensland (37.5%) and Gippsland (36.1%). Ritchie said Geelong and the Surf Coast told a very different story to outback Queensland.   Related: Watch the margins: competitive market forces have come to Australia\u2019s rural electorates    \u201cThis is an area that\u2019s one of the tier two cities and one of the fastest growing parts of the country,\u201d she says. Ritchie said all employment sectors in Geelong were on the rise due to enormous population migration. While many of the jobs available were for professionals, as regions try to build up health and other services for a growing population, Ritchie said finding the right housing for potential employees remained a problem. \u201cNot just in Geelong but right across the country in regional Australia, housing approvals and construction have not kept pace with population growth in our regions,\u201d Ritchie said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got government mobilising as quickly as they can, there\u2019s not a silver bullet here,\u201d she said. During the pandemic, more people were moving to the regions accompanied by an even bigger rise in people staying in regional areas. However, Ritchie said once a two way flow is re-established more housing will become available and regional Australia will be able to attract the key workers needed to take advantage of growth opportunities.", "From bush to beach: new NRL club offers hope for a region \u2018people usually drive through to get to Sunshine Coast\u2019 [2023-02-25T19:00:03Z]": "There\u2019s an emotive scene in Trent Dalton\u2019s novel Boy Swallows Universe in which young protagonist Eli Bell is perched atop an old bridge, battling to reel in a fish, when his serial prison-escaper friend, \u201cSlim\u201d Halliday, dies on its warped wooden planks. That rickety structure, the Hornibrook Bridge, long stood as a testament to the gulf between a metropolis and the sleepy communities to its north. To locals, it was known as the \u201chumpity bump\u201d. The few remnants of the bridge now lie in the shadows of two more modern structures that link Brisbane\u2019s northern bayside suburbs to the Redcliffe peninsula.   Related: The Dolphins: NRL\u2019s newest team well placed to make immediate impact | Nick Tedeschi    Like the commuters whizzing over Bramble Bay on the decidedly less romantic Ted Smout Memorial Bridge, this is a region going forward in a hurry. The smattering of sleepy bayside towns full of retirees and rural hinterland villages have been quietly growing and maturing. The Moreton Bay region is now home to almost half a million people. It\u2019s one of the fastest growing regions in the country, projected to accommodate at least 200,000 more people over the next two decades as young families flock to the region in search of affordable homes with access to the bush and the beach. And it\u2019s now preparing to announce itself on the national stage. \u2018A new era\u2019 Australia\u2019s newest top tier rugby league side is seeking to stamp its authority on the NRL. But the league\u2019s new kids will seek to evoke the emotion of their own storied past when the Redcliffe-born Dolphins enter the top flight for the first time this season. The man tasked with growing grassroots support for the team, Shane Morris, says the 75-year story of the Redcliffe Dolphins will help the new franchise win hearts and minds. \u201cWe are creating a new history, a new era,\u201d Morris says. \u201cBut it is building off what\u2019s happened in the past. That history is really important.\u201d The Dolphins\u2019 new era will begin on the first Sunday of March against the Roosters, in a nod to the greatest character in its history book: Arthur Beetson.    I\u2019ve never had a team that I can feel like this about. That this is my team  Matt Crowhurst, Dolphins fan     Beetson burst on to the scene aged 20 by steering Redcliffe to its first Brisbane rugby league title in 1965. \u201cBig Artie\u201d would go on to captain the Eastern Suburbs Roosters to two premierships in a career that saw him crowned one of the game\u2019s 13 immortals. But the Dolphins\u2019 clash with the Roosters is symbolic for another reason \u2013 one that has rugby league purists gnashing their teeth in frustration. Just as their inaugural opponents ditched the name of the community from which they arose in favour of the sweepingly unspecific Sydney label, so too have the NRL\u2019s new arrivals. Only they\u2019ve dropped geography entirely and will simply play under their nickname, the Dolphins. \u201cThat really gets my goat going,\u201d says Roger Waite, author of tomes including The Glory Days of the Brisbane Rugby League (1977 to 1987). \u201cThe nickname is basically the team. Location is the community. So what they\u2019ve done, by not having a location, is they\u2019ve essentially divorced themselves from the community.\u201d But the Dolphins believe they are fulfilling a mandate NRL boss Andrew Abdo charged them with when he awarded them the competition\u2019s 17th licence and a remit to \u201cown\u201d an area beyond Brisbane ambiguously titled \u201cthe northern corridor\u201d.    To Morris, that corridor runs up 500km north to central highlands behind Rockhampton, a swathe of country where he has spent 18 months visiting schools and clubs in an effort to give the Dolphins \u201ca point of difference\u201d. \u201cThis is making sure that we\u2019re visible in the community,\u201d Morris says. \u201cThat we\u2019re approachable.\u201d But approachable to whom? Creating identity The man who governs much of what will be the franchise\u2019s heartland, Moreton Bay mayor Peter Flannery, admits his region is not one to enjoy much brand recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s the area that people usually drive through to get to the Sunshine Coast,\u201d he says. Nor did the area\u2019s boundaries emerge organically \u2013 Flannery describes the 2008 amalgamation of three historic councils, including Redcliffe, into one local government area sprawling over more than 2,000 square kilometres, as \u201ca bit of a forced marriage\u201d.    A place is not just a geographical location. It is something we associate all sorts of feelings and pride  Dr Elin Charles-Edwards     \u201cBut that\u2019s the path we\u2019re on,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd part of my job as mayor is to bring the region together from being three separate areas to one large family.\u201d To that end, Flannery\u2019s council have backed the Redcliffe rugby league club\u2019s ascension for years, and the mayor admits he is disappointed the franchise didn\u2019t rebrand itself the Moreton Bay Dolphins. Because he knows if he wants to put his region on the map, to help create a place where people work, play and socialise and not just seek an affordable home with a back yard, then Moreton Bay needs a good story. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating identity,\u201d Flannery says. Associate professor in human geography at the University of Queensland, Elin Charles-Edwards, describes such identity construction as a \u201creally potent thing\u201d. She says Moreton Bay has traditionally been a \u201climinal space\u201d whose sense of identity was confined to its hinterland villages and \u201cold coastal resort towns where Brisbanites used to holiday in decades past\u201d on the east.    But with the rapid emergence of \u201creally large settlements\u201d like North Lakes and more to come in the form of Caboolture West, it was a region not only building new homes, but an emerging sense of place. \u201cA place is not just a geographical location,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is something that we imagine and we associate all sorts of feelings and pride \u2013 and a sports team is really good at fostering all those positive emotions.\u201d The home team Among those already bursting with pride at their \u201clocal team\u201d is a scribe of state league footy and Burpengary Jets masters player, Matt Crowhurst. A timber cutting town turned truck stop on the Bruce Highway, Burpengary, is now a booming suburb of about 16,500 people and a roughly 30-minute drive from Dolphins Oval.

September Redfest strawberry festival, Cleveland, Queensland2 \u2013 3 September A strawberry eating competition may not sound as impressive as, say, a chilli guzzling battle. A berry is too tasty, you might think, too easy to eat \u2013 and you would be right, though Redfest\u2019s strawberry contest is still a spectacle to behold, mainly because its young participants have to tuck into the plate of strawberries and cream before them \u2013 sans hands.

The federal scheme will pilot bringing up to 200 families on one- to four-year contracts starting this year, a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. This comes after years of the workers \u2013 who fill the gaps in Australia\u2019s agriculture, meat-works and aged care workforces under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme \u2013 being separated from their families. However, families who do relocate to Australia would not have access to Medicare, relocation would be at the discretion of the worker\u2019s employer, and the cost of travel and setting up a home would be at the worker\u2019s expense. And while they would have access to the childcare subsidy and family tax benefit, it was still not yet clear whether schools would be free for families Australia-wide, or only in some states.   Related: \u2018No support\u2019: Pacific Island labour-hire workers fear $6,000 cost of giving birth in Australia    \u201cThere are certain parameters in the way it has been set up which raise a few red flags for me in terms of the likelihood that workers are actually able to bring their families across,\u201d said Matt Withers, an expert on temporary labour migration at Australian National University. Without more government subsidies to help workers who want to bring their families over, Withers said it would undermine the point of the scheme. \u201cIt becomes a bit contradictory in that sense if we are loading all of these costs on to the workers themselves in a program that is basically designed to channel remittances back to Pacific Island countries,\u201d says Withers. Kerry McCarthy, who employs about 50 Pasifika under the scheme on her farm in rural Queensland, said her workers had mixed emotions about relocating their families. They wanted to have the connection to their children, she said, but they were also concerned about having less money when their contract ends and they return home. A number of workers use the money earned in Australia to build homes, sometimes lost to natural disasters, or to start businesses.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup  McCarthy, alongside Steve Burdette, the executive officer of Approved Employers of Australia, the group of businesses employing workers, is urging the government to give workers and their families access to Medicare to ease some financial burden. \u201cThese workers pay tax, they pay the Medicare levy. They are entitled to claim that levy back but many don\u2019t,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cSo a number are paying for it, but aren\u2019t getting any benefits.\u201d Workers are currently required to pay for health insurance, but president of the Pacific Islands Council in Queensland, Emma Vueti, said a number had been out of pocket for pre-existing conditions because insurance didn\u2019t cover that. This includes a number of parents working under the scheme that have had to pay thousands of dollars in hospital fees after giving birth in the first 12 months in Australia.   Related: Australia\u2019s expanded Pacific labour scheme could erode workers\u2019 rights, ex-official warns    In advice to workers wanting to use the scheme, Dfat warned families that may fall pregnant while in Australia that they would need to consider if they have sufficient funds to travel home for the birth or pay out-of-pocket hospital costs of up to A$10,000. \u201cIt\u2019s important they include pregnancy because we don\u2019t want families to come here then find that it\u2019s too expensive so they have to go and have the baby at home,\u201d Vueti said. How viable it would be for workers to bring their families over also raises equity issues given workers don\u2019t have a choice on where they work in Australia, Withers said. Robert Sivo, who is from Fiji and works in agriculture in a regional hub in New South Wales, is optimistic it will be easier to bring his six children and wife to Australia because he lives in a city. He hopes his wife, who will have the right to work in Australia, will be able to find employment to support the cost. \u201cThe reason I want to get them over here is for their safety, because I do worry about them when I\u2019m not there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will try to make the cost OK.\u201d But it will be a challenge for those living in rural areas, particularly accessing services such as childcare and whether or not there are vacant jobs for partners, and also housing. Many workers live in shared accommodation provided by the employer at an affordable cost, but families would probably need to find a private rental, McCarthy said. For the workers McCarthy employs, she said this will be a challenge given low rental vacancy rates in rural areas. \u201cWithout rental history, I think it will be difficult for workers to find the rentals without the employer stepping in and taking over some of that responsibility,\u201d she said. \u2022This story was amended on 23 January 2023 to clarify a quote", "NSW Labor criticised for directing preferences to Shooters party in key seats [2023-03-14T14:00:33Z]": "New South Wales Labor is being criticised for directing preferences to the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in a key marginal seat despite helping to pass a motion that condemned its leader, Robert Borsak, over an alleged verbal \u201cthreat of violence\u201d against a female MP. Material filed with the NSW Electoral Commission shows Labor is directing voters to preference the Shooters party in the seat of Upper Hunter ahead of the state election on 25 March. Held by the Nationals on a wafer-thin margin of 0.5%, it is one of two lower house seats \u2013 along with the electorate of Dubbo, where the Shooters hope to unseat the Nationals MP Dugald Saunders \u2013 where Labor has directed its preferences to the minor party.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But Labor is also directing upper house preferences to the Shooters in 15 seats across regional NSW, either as its third or fourth preference, a move it has defended as being necessary to stop One Nation\u2019s leader, Mark Latham, from becoming \u201cthe kingmaker of NSW politics\u201d. Among the 15 seats is Murray, held by the former Shooters MP Helen Dalton, who is now an independent. Although the party has ranked Dalton second in its lower house preferences, in the upper house it recommended voters in Murray put the Shooters third. It comes less than six months after Labor supported a motion moved by Dalton in the lower house that condemned Borsak for comments he allegedly made in parliament about her.   Related: What will it take to win the 2023 NSW election \u2013 and what happens if neither side wins a majority?    A recording of a debate in parliament last September appeared to capture someone, alleged to be Borsak, saying \u201che should\u2019ve gotten up and clocked her\u201d. Dalton alleged the comment was made in relation to her and moved a motion in the parliament condemning him for making \u201ca threat of violence\u201d. The motion stated Borsak\u2019s \u201cthreat\u201d constituted \u201cdangerous workplace behaviour\u201d and called on him to apologise. It was supported by Labor MPs, including the shadow minister for families, Port Stephens MP Kate Washington, who said it was \u201cimportant that this place is a safe place for women \u2013 and everyone \u2013 to work\u201d. \u201cViolence and threats of violence against members in this place are entirely unacceptable,\u201d she said during the debate. The fallout was devastating for the Shooters, with its two lower house MPs \u2013 Phil Donato in Orange and Roy Butler in Barwon \u2013 quitting to run as independents instead. Labor\u2019s move has been blasted by the Coalition\u2019s minister for women, Natalie Ward, who said the opposition leader, Chris Minns, \u201cneeds to explain why he is supporting Robert Borsak, when his own MPs left the party following his appalling treatment of a female MP\u201d. While the opposition hopes to see the Nationals unseated in Upper Hunter \u2013 one of the few regional seats where the conservative Shooters may still be in play \u2013 Labor sources also insist the move was intended to help limit One Nation\u2019s chances of securing a second or third upper house spot. The prospect of a larger One Nation contingent has grown in the wake of the declining fortunes of other minor rightwing parties such as the Liberal Democrats and Fred Nile\u2019s Christian Democrats. \u201cThat would make Mark Latham the kingmaker of NSW politics \u2013 on everything to do from climate change, renewables, public education, anti-discrimination and anti-racism policies,\u201d a Labor campaign spokesperson said. \u201cNSW Labor has given some preferences \u2013 with none in return \u2013 to try and stop that super crossbench majority forming in the upper house.\u201d Both Labor and Borsak said there had been no deal between the two parties. Borsak declined to comment on last year\u2019s controversy. The election analyst Ben Raue said depending on the way votes in the upper house go, the decision to put the Shooters third and fourth in a handful of seats could help the party on election day. While the majority of voters do not follow how-to-vote guides, preferences \u201cdo make a difference\u201d, he said. \u201cAt the last three elections the final seat changed because of preference flows favouring a particular candidate,\u201d he said.", "Why the Ben Roberts-Smith verdict is not a complete victory for journalism | Hugh Riminton [2023-06-01T20:30:42Z]": "Ben Roberts-Smith\u2019s personally disastrous defamation case is not the complete victory it seems for Australian journalism. The gruelling five-year legal battle will leave the Nine stable out of pocket by a seven-figure sum, even after payment of costs. As he took the train from his home on the New South Wales Central Coast to hear the judgment in Sydney, the veteran investigative journalist Chris Masters was in a ruminative mood.   Related: The man who wasn\u2019t there: Ben Roberts-Smith misses his day of reckoning     \u201cSadly, irrespective of the outcome, this won\u2019t be encouraging to brave, responsible, risk-taking journalism,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf this is what it takes, it\u2019s too much.\u201d A defamation specialist, Dr Matt Collins KC, said \u201cno new law\u201d had been created in the Roberts-Smith case. \u201cIt was purely about the facts, who was telling the truth.\u201d The new ground was the sheer financial scale. A senior legal source with intimate knowledge said the final bill could top $35m, including the costs for commonwealth barristers who attended court. The two main parties, Roberts-Smith and the journalists and outlets he was suing, are believed to have run up at least $25m between them. So here\u2019s the arithmetic. When a winning side claims costs, Collins said it typically recoups 66% to 75% of their actual legal bill. Nine has indicated it will seek what are called \u201cindemnity costs\u201d. In exceptional circumstances, according to the federal court website, a successful party can seek \u201call legal costs and disbursements that a party reasonably and properly incurred\u201d. In practice, according to Collins, that\u2019s no more than 85% to 90% of actual costs. Usually the party would have to prove the other side rejected an earlier offer to settle. That Roberts-Smith was given an option to settle and didn\u2019t take it would itself raise questions about his judgment and that of his legal team. But on those numbers, even in winning, Nine will be out of pocket at least $1.25m. On a conventional cost finding, it will be more like $4.25m. And that assumes Roberts-Smith has the means, or the friends, to pay. Which explains Masters\u2019 somewhat morose mood on the day of one of the biggest legal victories of his celebrated journalistic career. \u201cThis should go down in history as one of the great moments in Australian media,\u201d he said. But journalism still faced \u201cdeath by a thousand courts\u201d. Nine\u2019s managing director, James Chessell, says his organisation would continue its pursuit of Australian war criminals. But Masters said institutional self-censorship is almost unavoidable. \u201cThe costs are prohibitive irrespective of the outcome,\u201d he said. The media was \u201calready on its knees\u201d. Making judgments on which stories to pursue, even when you\u2019re confident you\u2019re right \u201cis as much a game of deep pockets as a contest of the law\u201d.  Masters\u2019 work for Four Corners in the 1980s helped bring down the corrupt Bjelke-Petersen government In Queensland. He won the Gold Walkley, Australian journalism\u2019s highest prize, for revealing that the bombing of the Greenpeace boat Rainbow Warrior in Auckland was an act of state terrorism by France. Another major Walkley came with his revealing book on the Sydney power-jock Alan Jones. But court action lasted 13 years after his Queensland expos\u00e9s. Now a further five years in the courts over his work on war crimes. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can call that a victory.\u201d Still, the opposite result from Judge Anthony Besanko would have been, Masters said, \u201cthe death knell\u201d for serious journalism in Australia. \u201cThe media will be herded into the shallow water [of only reporting insignificant stories].\u201d  Collins agrees. Had Roberts-Smith won, \u201cwhat stories are likely to be spiked? How much more likely are media organisations to go after the powerless rather than the rich and powerful who can afford to take you on?\u201d Instead, journalism is out of pocket after the Roberts-Smith show.

Children By Choice (CBC) chief executive, Daile Kelleher, said there have been devastating stories from women struggling with lengthy wait times, conflicting advice, and some forced to travel long distances to access abortion services. Kelleher said the closure of clinics operated by private non-for-profit healthcare service Marie Stopes in Southport, Townsville and Rockhampton has created increased demand in south-east Queensland, blowing out wait times by up to six weeks in some cases. \u201cPregnancy is a time-sensitive diagnosis,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cThe more delays that people face \u2026 that actually has sort of real implications to the healthcare that they receive.\u201d Since December 2018, abortion has been legal in Queensland and available on request as a health service, up until 22 weeks gestation. After 22 weeks, a second doctor must be consulted. \u201cWhat we\u2019re also finding is that \u2026 not a lot of hospitals are actually embedding termination of pregnancy care within their hospitals,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cSo a regional person might have to travel a couple of hundred kilometres to Brisbane to access a publicly funded termination.\u201d Kelleher said CBC had supported a central Queensland woman in her 30s who had suffered significant domestic violence, sexual abuse and financial difficulties. She had a four-year-old daughter and no income.   Related: Queensland to issue free flu vaccinations as cases jump 132% in one week    She eventually had to travel to Brisbane to receive healthcare, with CBC offering her financial support, including a $250 petrol voucher so she could take her car, her child and flee the relationship. CBC also provided support to another woman who learned she was pregnant while in Iraq, where she was refused an abortion. Upon her relocation to Australia, the woman undertook mandatory home quarantine and was denied an abortion as it was assessed as non-essential healthcare. Once released, the mother-of-five attempted suicide and attempted to self-abort after being told by staff at a private hospital they could not perform an abortion \u201cdue to religious reasons\u201d. She was eventually able to access a termination at about 23 weeks after consulting a private service who referred her to a public hospital for surgery. Kelleher said while abortion is legal in Queensland, some health practitioners and hospitals are conscientious objectors, further complicating access. Marie Stopes\u2019 managing director, Jamal Hakim, said access to abortions was a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d across the country. Hakim said abortions were free in public hospitals for Queenslanders who hold Medicare cards. But he said Marie Stopes has seen an increase in those without Medicare cards \u2013 such as migrants and international students \u2013 seeking terminations. \u201cOften private health insurance doesn\u2019t cover abortion care. For international students who are highly vulnerable \u2026 they fall through the gaps,\u201d he said. Marie Stopes provides a \u201cChoice Fund\u201d to assist people struggling to afford abortion and contraception.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        Out-of-pocket costs for surgical abortions are approximately $620, while medication-based abortion through Telehealth is generally about $430, Hakim said. However, costs increase with the duration of the gestation period and complexity of the termination service. Hakim said abortion care was \u201cchronically underfunded\u201d and some Marie Stopes centres in Queensland were closed due to the increased costs of delivering day surgeries. At the time of the closures, Queensland\u2019s health minister, Yvette D\u2019Ath, did not commit to restoring the services. She said she would continue to make sure \u201cwomen can access safe and high-quality termination of pregnancy services no matter where they live\u201d. But Hakim believes the way the health system supports abortion services in regional, remote and rural areas needs \u201ca rethink\u201d. \u201cDay surgeries are under a lot of pressure to deliver care in remote areas with increased regulation and increased cost of delivery, with very little funding increase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently working with the hospital and health services to look at how we can deliver more care closer to home.\u201d ", "March of the fire ants could reach Sydney\u2019s outskirts by 2035, costing economy up to $1.2bn a year  [2023-06-01T15:00:38Z]": "Failing to stop the spread of an outbreak of invasive fire ants in south-east Queensland could cost the Australian economy more than $1bn a year, including damage to high-value crops, infrastructure and homes. A previously unreleased cost-benefit analysis, commissioned by a steering committee managing the outbreak of red fire ants and obtained by Guardian Australia, says eradication of the species provides \u201cmuch higher returns\u201d than suppression measures that simply limit its spread. The study says the spread of the ants, which were first detected in Brisbane in 2001, would cause \u201ccascading negative impacts on future generations\u201d.   Related: The ants go rafting: invasive fire ants take to Australian flood waters to colonise new areas    Australian governments have a $400m eradication program but, despite the investment, red fire ants continue to spread. Finds on the Gold Coast have raised concerns the pests are moving quickly towards New South Wales. \u201cFire ants are just a few kilometres from the NSW border and, when they break out, they can quickly spread everywhere in Australia,\u201d said Reece Pianta from the Invasive Species Council. The report, by economists at Central Queensland University, modelled the economic impacts of the spread of fire ants if their invasion progressed at 5km a year, and a \u201cmaximum\u201d spread of 48km a year.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  In the first scenario, the pests will have reached high-value farmland in the Darling Downs by 2035. In the worst case, fire ants reach the Liverpool plains and the northern outskirts of Sydney in the same time period. By 2035 the annual cost to the economy in the 5km invasion scenario was about $890m, increasing significantly year on year. Under the 48km scenario, the costs would be about $1.2bn a year. The biggest cost would be to households, including the cost of pesticides, veterinary bills and electrical faults. \u201cThere are much higher returns available from eradication options compared to suppression options, largely because suppression would still lead to large impacts by [2035], especially on households and agriculture,\u201d the report said.   Related: Ryegrass, fire ants and feral cats: major Australian study identifies costliest pests in past 60 years    Pianta said the report supported calls for more investment in eradication measures. \u201cThe cost of action on fire ants is far cheaper than the cost of living with fire ants,\u201d he said. \u201cFire ant damage predicted in the report is becoming a reality in southern Queensland. Fire ants are closing playing fields, garden centres and parks, impacting cane fields, schools, housing construction and natural habitat. \u201cIf we do not urgently step up eradication efforts, we face the fire ant future being experienced in the United States where fire ants cost $7bn per year in damage and control.\u201d According to the Queensland government, fire ants may have arrived in Australia \u2013 possibly via shipping containers from the Americas \u2013 decades before they were detected.", "Watch the margins: competitive market forces have come to Australia\u2019s rural electorates [2022-05-19T17:30:04Z]": "I once stayed in a city pub where the roof opened up as the obligatory afternoon Sydney storm rolled through. We scrambled to move our suitcase out of the torrent of water and went downstairs to see the manager. He replied, without a hint of irony, \u201cif you think your room is bad, you should see mine\u201d. I was reminded of that hotel this week when I read that Barnaby Joyce was complaining about the lack of available childcare in his electorate. The deputy prime minister told the Northern Daily Leader that his partner, Vicki, struggled to return to work without adequate childcare as he announced that if the Coalition won a fourth term, it would fund a $3m childcare centre at Guyra. Joyce was right in that research by the Mitchell Institute, at Victoria University, found that 35.2% of the Australian population lives in a childcare \u201cdesert\u201d and New England had the lowest level of access in NSW. But it was yet another example of identifying problems as if he played no part in his nine-year-old government. It continues a longer tradition of playing the anti-politician politician, appealing to those who want to get government off their back. The second most powerful politician in the land could also add a list of other outstanding issues plaguing rural and regional electorates. These include a lack of evidence-based infrastructure planning, systemic health service failures, a majority of rural aged care facilities losing money, housing shortages to rent and to buy, natural disasters linked to climate change and water management.   Related: \u2018Get ready for silly\u2019: signs of change on the Cowper campaign    These issues all play into rural contests in various proportions depending on the place. Instead of big strategic policy ideas to address looming challenges, we have instead seen more one-off grant programs from the Coalition. Labor has largely steered clear of more obviously rural seats to concentrate their resources on winnable regional centres. Let\u2019s face it, many rural electorates are allergic to Labor, notwithstanding the party\u2019s birth in the bush.    Instead, Albanese has targeted semi-regional seats in Tasmania and Queensland while hoping to hold off the Coalition in seats like Hunter in NSW and Lingiari in the Northern Territory. So the fact remains that most rural and regional electorates will stay in conservative hands. As always in rural politics, watch the margins. A closer look at the 2022 federal election campaign provides proof of slow but changing trends in rural electorates. First, community independent candidates, usually of the small-l liberal variety, are starting to make inroads. The trend is strongest in Victoria and dissipates the farther north you travel. It reflects the Barnaby Line \u2013 the map of Joyce\u2019s appeal which is strong in the north, but not so much in the south. It was a point reinforced by the former Nationals minister Darren Chester, who asked voters not to be \u201cpunish\u201d him for his leader on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s not logical to say to me \u2018a vote for Darren is a vote for Barnaby\u2019 given I have publicly disagreed with him on several issues that are important to regional Australia\u2019s future. And I didn\u2019t vote for him to return as leader,\u201d he wrote.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        Nicholls in Victoria is the clearest regional seat in play on a whopping 20% margin, but things are also getting interesting in Cowper and Calare. In Queensland, Hinkler is definitely worth watching, with the former state LNP minister Jack Dempsey running as an independent against the Coalition federal water minister, Keith Pitt. Groom, too, is fascinating because of the religious right and the inroads which may count towards the next election by a former LNP member turned independent, Suzie Holt. Second, while independents remain a minority option for now, they are becoming a more culturally acceptable alternative in conservative rural seats as they use models like the \u201cVoices For\u201d movement to build volunteer bases that can rival party memberships.    For example, the Cowper independent candidate, Caz Heise, admitted she was formerly a member of the Greens on Australian Story on Monday night. As someone campaigning on climate change among other issues, it will be a test of whether that previously unacceptable link will hurt her in a National party-held seat battered by floods and fires, and whether her large supporter base can neutralise the National\u2019s attack ads. Third, the whole shift is attracting more media coverage, which has created a profile for candidates previously hard to build. It creates an expectation among voters that competition brings more attention and more promises. They have learned the magic of electoral marginality \u2013 a big change from past elections. Fourth, all three factors are happening before we even work out the effect of regional migration as a result of the pandemic. These trends have the capacity to change campaigning significantly. The campaign for the independent Rob Priestly in Nicholls has attracted a volunteer base of close to 500. They have moved their election night venue to accommodate a much larger crowd.   Related: Texts sent out falsely claiming independent challenger in Nationals seat has Labor backing    In Cowper, the volunteer base is about the same number. In Indi, the sitting independent MP, Helen Haines, can now call on a volunteer base of 1,800 people. Any party membership director would be pretty pleased with those numbers to draw on in individual electorates. Every one of those volunteers has a social impact. In conservative communities, seeing people you know and trust stand up for something carries great weight. That is how rural seats have remained rusted on to the Liberals and Nationals for so long; the Coalition are part of the furniture and that doesn\u2019t change easily. There is a live experiment in Nicholls in these dying stages of the campaign. Texts and letters erroneously trying to link Priestly to the Labor premier, Dan Andrews, appeared in residents\u2019 phones and letterboxes this week. Priestly supporters immediately took to social media to condemn the last-minute attempt.    Think of each one of the voters who called out that behaviour as a social algorithm and you can see how that power builds. Large numbers of engaged people will have an effect, at the dinner table, in the workplace, in the bakery and at the barbecue on this and future elections. None of this means the death of conservatism in the bush or the last nail in the National party coffin. Rusted-off voters will desert the major parties at various times and will return when they feel the need. But it does bring competitive market forces to rural electorates to make sitting MPs work harder for every vote. Free market parties would have to agree that\u2019s a good thing.

The nationally representative poll of 2,032 Australians, which was conducted by YouGov, also found that 51% of respondents were \u201cvery or fairly worried\u201d about climate change and extreme weather events in Australia. Of the 80% who reported experiencing at least one extreme weather event, the most common disasters Australians had lived through were heatwaves (63%), flooding (47%), bushfires (42%) and droughts (36%).

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  People in rural or regional areas were more than 1.5 times as likely to have experienced flooding than people in urban areas (61% compared to 38%), and were also more likely to report inadequate or unavailable mental health services following a natural disaster (41% compared to 33%). Queensland and New South Wales residents were the most likely to have experienced multiple disasters since 2019. Of those polled in Queensland and NSW, more than a third in both states had experienced multiple flooding events \u2013 compared to 13% in Victoria, 5% in Western Australia and 4% in South Australia. In addition to YouGov polling, the Climate Council carried out a follow-up survey asking people who had lived through a natural disaster about their experiences. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were common, and more than a third of these respondents reported inadequate mental health support.

But is Peter Dutton listening? | Paul Karp [2023-04-07T15:00:08Z]": "While their opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament captured the headlines this week, the Liberal party\u2019s meetings in Canberra were also focused on how to respond to the Aston loss. The party\u2019s first reaction was to not panic. To stand by Peter Dutton as leader and maybe start to think about the need for new policies on issues such as home ownership and the climate. But there is a growing split between the party\u2019s conservative and moderate faction about whether broader changes are needed. This depends on whether one views the once-in-a-century byelection defeat as the latest tumble in a long decline for the Liberals, or an aberration that will be rectified by the electoral pendulum inevitably swinging back their way. Simon Birmingham, a leading moderate, argued this week that \u201cperceptions of intolerance created by some hasn\u2019t just cost the votes of those who feel judged, it has hurt the Liberal party with all who reject nastiness or divisiveness\u201d.   Related: Peter Dutton urged to differentiate Liberal party after Aston loss prompts identity crisis    This reminded me of what former minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer said after the 2018 Victorian state election wipeout: that the Liberal party is regarded as full of \u201chomophobic, anti-women, climate-change deniers\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  That warning went unheeded. Then, as Scott Morrison pulled off his miracle election victory against Bill Shorten\u2019s tax agenda in 2019, the warning bell of Tony Abbott losing his inner-city seat of Warringah was also ignored. While gains in suburban marginals such as Longman and Lindsay helped the Coalition stay in power in 2019, the next election delivered an inner-city bloodbath. There were six losses to teal independents, two to the Greens in Brisbane, and a swag more to Labor in Western Australia, Bennelong and Higgins. Then came another Victorian election wipeout, the New South Wales loss, and Aston. That\u2019s the long decline that has to be reversed if the Liberals are to become \u201ca credible alternative government\u201d, which is what Bridget Archer says she is fighting for with the party \u201cat a crossroads\u201d. Archer does not agree with the Liberal party\u2019s opposition to the voice. She\u2019s not alone; in the shadow cabinet Simon Birmingham, Paul Fletcher and Marise Payne also opposed locking in against constitutional recognition, as did a few more MPs in the party room. Archer has been the bluntest about the party\u2019s overall direction. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve learned the lessons from the 2022 election or the Aston byelection,\u201d she told the ABC. But there is an alternative school of thought on the Aston loss among Liberals \u2013 one that refuses to join the dots and instead focuses on one-off factors.  Luke Howarth, a Queensland conservative, told the Liberals\u2019 shadow ministerial meeting that the key lesson from Aston was that the party needs to preselect a local candidate.   Related: Malcolm Turnbull says the \u2018chickens are coming home to roost\u2019 for Liberal party after Aston byelection loss    The Liberal candidate, Roshena Campbell, was a brilliant woman from a diverse background, but Labor\u2019s Mary Doyle lived closer to the Aston electorate for longer, and drew stronger local support as a result. Others argue that it\u2019s just too early in the first term of the Albanese government to expect the opposition to hold on to a seat. It couldn\u2019t hurt to have a better pipeline of talent, so the Liberals aren\u2019t having to pick between the best candidate on paper and someone who actually lives in or near an electorate. But to ignore the broader decline in metro areas and treat Aston as an anomaly would be disastrous. So which view does the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, subscribe to? Well, on Tuesday he went to Albury, in deputy leader Sussan Ley\u2019s seat of Farrer, to say \u201cwe are the party of regional and rural Australia\u201d and that too much of Labor\u2019s effort is \u201cconcentrated on capital cities\u201d. That is not an encouraging sign. Rather than casting the Coalition as a broad church that encompasses moderates and conservatives, in the cities and the regions, he continued to narrow his messaging and in turn the party\u2019s appeal. Contrast this with a significant thing the Albanese government did this week: promise more funding to national collecting institutions, including the National Gallery of Australia. This is the sort of thing that could be passed off as an inner-city concern; one for latte-sipping, art gallery-attending sophisticates. But the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the arts minister, Tony Burke, framed the spending as an investment in national pride. Albanese noted that Jackson Pollock\u2019s painting Blue Poles, purchased by the Whitlam government, is now worth 38,000 times what it cost to buy.  It was \u201cabsurd\u201d to house a $500m artwork \u201cin a building with buckets to collect leaks from a leaky roof\u201d, he said. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, referred to the culture package as an example of \u201ccleaning up the mess\u201d in the Coalition\u2019s budget, by not hiding costs or ignoring the need for ongoing funding. These were arguments that were perfectly crafted for middle-of-the road voters. The sort of pitch that would stand up just as well in the front bar of a regional pub as it would at a wine and cheese night at an urban gallery. The Albanese government is speaking to all Australians even as it enacts progressive policies, while the Liberal party is ignoring its most compelling internal voices of dissent who are urging it not to drive off the electoral cliff.", "Dozens of independent newspapers launched during Covid in Australia.

The RACGP wants IUD insertion to be made more affordable, and financial support for GPs to train in surgical abortion and long-acting reversible contraception procedures. The RACGP submission also calls for nationally consistent legislation for medical and surgical termination.

Related: Australia\u2019s vaping crackdown to be enforced with new laws    The lithium-ion batteries embedded in vaping products have been blamed for an increasing number of hazardous fires at landfill sites across the nation. Last month an incorrectly disposed vaping device caused a fire in a recycling truck in Benalla, in north-east Victoria.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Shannon Cooper, resource recovery coordinator for Benalla rural city council, told Guardian Australia that batteries from a vaping device had been incorrectly put into the recycling. \u201cWhat happened is that the scraping of the batteries on the metal inside that hopper has caused the fire to spark,\u201d Cooper said. The driver, also a member of the local fire service, drove the truck to the Benalla fire station to have the fire put out. \u201cIt was quick thinking and the fact that it hadn\u2019t gone any further into the truck that saved it from doing any serious damage,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cNo battery-operated e-waste should ever go into your landfill bin or the recycling bin,\u201d the Benalla mayor, Bernie Hearn, said. \u201cWhen people dispose of their vapes, they should take the batteries out and dispose of the batteries properly.\u201d Pip Kiernan, the head of Clean Up Australia, said consumers should not be left to navigate the complexities of how local councils classify the waste. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess and it\u2019s no wonder they are ending up as litter. There is an urgent need for national consistency.

So there\u2019s a cash incentive for consumers to do it, and it\u2019s very clear how to do it. \u201cAnd in that instance, the beverage companies are responsible for that \u2013 financially.\u201d A report by the NSW environmental watchdog last year said vape sales had climbed from $28.3m in 2015 to $98.1m in 2020.

Last month, the government pledged to introduce new legislation to ban non-therapeutic and disposable single use vapes domestically. \u201cWe will continue working with state, territory and local governments on better managing waste,\u201d Plibersek said. Policies and regulations on waste are the responsibility of state and territory governments but the federal government can take a leadership role. It has done that in the past, helping state and territory environment ministers lock in reforms to ensure packaging waste is minimised and that, where it is used, it is designed to be recovered, reused, recycled or reprocessed. E-cigarettes can also contain carcinogens and toxic heavy metals that pose an issue if they leach from landfill into soil and waterways.

Every sample contained nicotine, toxic heavy metals including arsenic, lead, mercury and chromium, and known carcinogens such as formaldehyde.", "Morning Mail: ACBF-Youpla victims wait for compensation, Oscar goodie bag gift prompts questions [2023-03-12T20:09:12Z]": "Good morning.

Housing supply in the region of more than 60,000 people has become almost nonexistent. \u201cAs it stands today, we\u2019ve only got three [rental homes] on our books,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd two of them are $500-a-week-plus.\u201d The rental crisis has pushed an unprecedented number of people into the hunt for social housing in a region which has not traditionally had a problem with access to affordable homes. Lynda Townsend, homelessness manager with Tamworth Family Support Services (TFSS) in the New England region of New South Wales, says she has never seen a situation this bad.    Like many community housing and social support service providers in regional NSW, she has witnessed a rise in evictions and homelessness during one of the coldest winters on record; while Covid, floods, and increased demand for housing have left many living even closer to the edge. Domestic violence has increased not so much in frequency but \u201cin viciousness\u201d, Townsend says, as couples were forced together in tight spaces during lockdowns, jobs were lost, schools closed, and families stressed. \u201cI\u2019ve been in my role three years, and we\u2019ve never had a waitlist, but at the moment I\u2019ve got around 40 that are waiting for a case manager. \u201cSome women in our refuge are staying there for up to six months,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we weren\u2019t in the midst of a housing crisis, we would actually have them out in two or three weeks, once we\u2019ve got them stabilised.\u201d Townsend estimates that vacancies in Tamworth have dropped to a fifth of normal levels. \u201cIt\u2019s typically around 3.5%. The latest availability we have is 0.7%,\u201d she says. Data collected by TFSS client surveys shows that the proportion of people seeking assistance who cite \u201cHousing crisis (eg eviction)\u201d as the main reason for needing help has more than doubled from the 2019-2020 to the 2021-22 financial years, from 19.2% to 41.2%. The proportion looking for assistance due to \u201cHousing Affordability Stress\u201d also rose from 3.2% to 6.1% for the same period.    Plentiful housing myth Migration to regional centres hasn\u2019t just been driven by tree-changers unshackled from their city offices, but also by those marginalised in the cities who have bought into the myth of plentiful, cheap housing in the bush. Flood victims who\u2019ve lost rentals elsewhere have also come to Tamworth. If you\u2019re already sleeping in your car, you may as well drive it somewhere, Townsend says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a family that were in Ipswich. Their house was condemned after the floods in Queensland, and they were told to go down to Tamworth. \u201cThey were actually camping at one of our dams with two small children \u2013 one a seven-month-old.\u201d Elderly long-term renters are also being driven out of homes, with the temptation of increased rental incomes proving too great for many landlords. This has led to a rise in 90-day evictions, where owners are asking tenants on rolling tenancies to vacate the property without having to give a reason. One 78-year-old TFSS client was given a 90-day eviction notice for the property he\u2019d rented for 15 years when the owner decided to sell. He is now living in his car. Winter temperatures in Tamworth can get to below 0C at night. Nick Grimes, senior housing manager at Homes North community housing company in Tamworth, has seen a notable increase in clients seeking public housing. \u201cEvictions have absolutely increased\u201d over the past couple of years, he says. \u201cTamworth and Armidale have never been considered high-demand areas for social housing. But in the last year and a half, they have become so .\u201d According to Grimes, \u201ca whole new cohort of people\u201d who have never before required social housing are now asking Homes North for help. \u201cThey\u2019ve held down regular jobs and their first port of call was the real estate [agent],but the real estate [agent] was at capacity, so they\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cThose people then wonder, \u2018Well, what else is out there?\u2019; and that\u2019s when they turn to us.\u201d Some demographics are underserved even by the already-strained services available to the homeless, Grimes says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a women\u2019s refuge, which is fantastic. We\u2019ve got a youth refuge. But probably the bulk of what I come across is single men. There\u2019s no refuge for single men,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for them to go.\u201d    \u2018Domino effect\u2019 According to George Barton, a real estate agent with McCulloch Agencies, an increase of $10 a week might have been the norm once, but it\u2019s not uncommon for renters to now face a $30 or $40 hike in weekly rent. \u201cWe feel for them. We\u2019ll go over and beyond to help them find that next one,\u201d he says. Barton is seeing an exodus of property buyers coming out of Sydney. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the biggest transfer of population out of the metros into the regions since the second world war,\u201d he says. Metro residents who bought lifestyle blocks in places like Mudgee are realising they can sell their property, clear all their debts, then pick up a home on just as big a block in Tamworth with the profits, Barton says. \u201cSydney\u2019s bought out the Central Coast, and the Central Coast\u2019s bought out the Upper Hunter, and the Upper Hunter are moving up here,\u201d in what he describes as a \u201cdomino effect\u201d. Tianah, a young mother with two daughters and a third on the way, returned to Tamworth after leaving family in Queanbeyan and spending time in rehab for drug use. She is currently in a TFSS transitional home, which she shares with her younger sister. \u201cWe need at least a three-bedroom house,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for everything I can, and I\u2019ve just been knocked back for everything so far. \u201cI think that I\u2019ll get housing now, because I\u2019ve done everything that I\u2019ve had to do.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter      Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter   Dakota* is a middle-aged woman who fled both domestic and criminal violence in Queensland, forcing her to shut down her small business and move back to Tamworth.

Every August, the almond industry requires 300,000 beehives to pollinate the national crop, which represents the largest movement of livestock in the country. But under the emergency order issued on Sunday after the varroa mite was detected at the Port of Newcastle, no bees are allowed to be moved across NSW, which is home to 44% of the nation\u2019s beehives. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Covid for bees,\u201d Cormac Farrell, the head beekeeper at Australian Parliament House, says.   Related: What is the varroa mite and does it pose a threat? The deadly parasite that sent NSW into bee lockdown    \u201cWe have to stop it at the border to stop it from spreading through the wider landscape and make sure that it can\u2019t get out and infect other hives.\u201d  Tim Jackson the CEO of the Almond Board of Australia says \u201cthe timing of the outbreak could not be worse for the almond industry\u201d. He says the huge number of beehives required for the blossom event already goes close to \u201cmaxing out\u201d all available commercial beehives of New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and southern Queensland and any limitation on bee numbers could have a devastating effect. Danny Le Feuvre, the acting CEO of the Australian Honeybee Industry Council, says almond pollination accounts for 10% of beekeepers\u2019 income. Honeybees also pollinate apples, pears and cherries in September, avocados in October, and seed production later in the year. \u201cAbout one in every three mouthfuls of food that you eat has had pollination by honeybees in some shape or form,\u201d he says. Le Feuvre says the rapid rollout of restrictions would hopefully result in a swift containment of the mite and minimise the impact of the outbreak on major agricultural pollination events. But he says the industry has already started gameplanning ways to allow for the restricted movement of essential bees, if the bee workforce remains locked down when major pollination events \u2013 like the looming almond pollination \u2013 take place. The almond board is working with the taskforce in charge of the outbreak to work through all options.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        It is difficult for industry to have a definite plan for allowing essential bee movement until they have a clearer idea of the extent of the incursion, Jackson says, but they are hopeful that cold winter conditions will have limited the spread. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early to be panicking, but we\u2019re on Code Red as far as concern around how this outbreak will be managed and how we can best pollinate a billion-dollar crop in just over a month,\u201d he says. There are already not enough bees to do the job: Guy Gaeta, the chair of the NSW Farmers horticultural committee, says that if the outbreak reduces honeybee populations that would cause a significant issue for farmers. Gaeta says the recent spike in almond farms, which require a lot of bees, has caused shortages and price hikes for other agricultural industries. Gaeta uses 50 hives for a three-week period each year to pollinate his apple and cherry farm outside Orange. He says if his beekeeper is only able to bring 30 it will affect his production.    Varroa mites have slipped past Australia\u2019s biosecurity provisions before, notably in Queensland and Victoria, and been successfully contained.  \u201cAll efforts have been made to minimise the impact of this incursion while also recognising the very serious threat that it poses,\u201d Jackson says. Australia produces 10% of global almond supply, the second biggest producer behind California which provides 80% of global supply. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from being a boutique industry 15 years ago to the richest horticultural export crop in Australia,\u201d Jackson says.   Related: Strange bee-haviour: social life of Australian species offers insights on evolution, scientists say    Farrell says the winter loss rates of bees (which is the measure of bee survival) in Australia where the varroa mite is not present is below 5%. Loss rates in the United States are between 30 and 40%. Canada lost up to 90% of its bees over winter in some regions. \u201cAnd there are a whole range of factors contributing to this, but the varroa is a really big part of this problem,\u201d he said. Anything above 20% is considered too high by Australian beekeepers, Farrell says. Farrell\u2019s hives in Canberra are not included in the control order, but he is asking all ACT beekeepers to sit tight. \u201cIf we\u2019re moving gear around, if we\u2019re moving hives around, the chance for an infected hive to slip through the net increases a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we\u2019re just really asking people, even if it\u2019s scary, please just sit tight, let [Department of Primary Industries] do their job and figure out where this is.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Budget cuts and Morrison\u2019s pledges: where are the biggest savings coming from? [2022-10-25T09:18:09Z]": "The Albanese government has ripped at least $9bn of regional, environmental and infrastructure spending out of the federal budget, much of it linked to Scott Morrison\u2019s bid to win Nationals\u2019 support for net zero. The cuts reverse some of the Morrison government\u2019s most controversial spending, from pre-2019 election commitments including the urban congestion fund, the Hells Gate Dam and regional funds established by the Coalition\u2019s last budget in March.

This includes a cut of $769m from the urban congestion fund, including a $160m saving from the controversial commuter car park fund, which the auditor general found was used to fund Coalition election commitments. If you\u2019re hoping to park and ride at MacArthur or East Hills on the T8 line, or Hurstville in New South Wales; or Bentleigh, Ferntree Gully or Hampton in Victoria then there is bad news: the budget axes the commuter car parks promised for these suburbs. Other cuts from the Coalition\u2019s infrastructure investment program include upgrades to the Wakehurst Parkway in NSW and Dorset Road in Victoria. The government has also \u201creprofiled\u201d the funding of existing projects, meaning the projects will still be built but over a longer timeframe, with $6.5bn of infrastructure spending pushed out of the forward estimates (the next four years) into the medium term. The budget papers explain this was done \u201cto better align investment with construction market conditions\u201d. Although this measure is a net $4.7bn saving, the government is also spending in the infrastructure portfolio, including:  $2.6bn for Victoria, including $2.2bn for the Suburban Rail Loop East $2.1bn for Queensland, including $866m for the Bruce Highway $1.4bn for NSW, including $500m for the early planning for Sydney-to-Newcastle rail  Regions The budget shows a $1.4bn saving for \u201cresponsible investment to grow our regions\u201d. The energy security and regional development plan will be slashed by $6.4bn.

It was a hit job on the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. After Bavas posted his article side-by-side on Twitter with Gleeson\u2019s article, Courier-Mail staff demanded to know what Jones was going to do about the plagiarism. Jones told them he was taking it seriously and posted an uncharacteristically frank note for a News Corp editor on the offending online article: \u201cEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story included four paragraphs which were not the author\u2019s work. News Corporation\u2019s Code of Conduct states that \u2018plagiarism is theft\u2019. The Courier-Mail apologises for this error.\u201d The Courier-Mail published a page-four apology from Gleeson in which he claimed the plagiarism was \u201cunintentional\u201d. \u201cI deeply regret the fact that material written by another journalist appeared under my byline in The Courier-Mail last Saturday,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was not a deliberate act by me to use another person\u2019s work and present it as my own.\u201d But after further revelations of plagiarism, including by the ABC\u2019s Media Watch which found Gleeson took big chunks of a 2015 story by the ex-Courier-Mail journalist Jason Tin, he was let go.", "Disaster fatigue: how nine floods in six months have taken a toll on a NSW farming community [2022-11-26T19:00:34Z]": "It\u2019s the day after the ninth flood in six months in the New South Wales town of Gunnedah, and Ellen Howland is in her empty gym on the corner of Bloomfield and Chandos streets \u2013 just back from where the Namoi River broke its banks. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a mindset coach,\u201d Howland says. \u201cI generally am very positive, but I am exhausted.

More than 230,000 insurance claims, totalling more than $5.5bn, were submitted for flood-related damage between January and October \u2013 not including the most recent flooding in Victoria and NSW. For many of Howland\u2019s clients, gym sessions are a much-needed social occasion, an excuse to drive into town, do a class and grab a smoothie from the caf\u00e9. But with the clients cut off or the gym shut, Howland worries about them.    \u201cIt is starting to take its toll,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with people that have had some health challenges as well.

Equally I think there\u2019s been people in rural Australia who have viewed Labor with suspicion,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of a clean slate here to work constructively with both the industry and rural areas, generally, around some shared goals. And I mean, climate change is a really good example of that.\u201d Watt said he was considering a new Landcare-style scheme to address the climate crisis and sustainability. It could build on the 30-year-old partnership between farmers and the environmental movement, which is a legacy of the Hawke government.   Related: What will the new Labor government do for rural and regional Australia?    \u201cWe\u2019ve got to the point where the National party was pretty unrepresentative of what real farmers actually wanted,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI think that if we manage climate change action and the push for sustainability in agriculture sensibly, I think that\u2019s an example of an issue where there\u2019s an opportunity to really build a strong partnership. \u201cAll the farm groups and individual farmers I\u2019ve met with, not just since taking on the portfolio, but even beforehand, they\u2019re up for this. They want to be part of this. Now we can turn the page and think about how we revamp some of these structures and mechanisms and bring farmers to the centre of it.\u201d Watt was also open to the idea of a national food strategy, as governments globally grapple with food security and supply chain issues. The Gillard government promised a national food plan in 2013 shortly before losing office, but it lapsed under the Coalition. The Food Policy Working Group in the agriculture department was abolished in the Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously growing concern about food security, particularly what\u2019s happening overseas and that is something I\u2019ve started thinking about.\u201d Watt committed to bring farm industry leaders, unions and First Nations people together to discuss solutions to the dire shortage in the agriculture workforce.   Related: \u2018Fair\u2019 development of renewables in regional Australia could eliminate future energy crises, report says    Labor has promised a dedicated agriculture visa stream under the established Palm (Pacific Australia Labor Mobility) scheme, effectively replacing the Coalition\u2019s new visa for the forestry, fishery, and farm industries, targeting workers from south-east Asia. The move angered farm groups even though no workers had arrived on the Coalition\u2019s scheme at the election. \u201cI\u2019m not dewy eyed about the potential of that to fix the problem,\u201d Watt said. \u201cBut, there\u2019s some incredibly interesting careers in agriculture, particularly on a permanent basis with the kind of technology that\u2019s coming in.\u201d He defended Labor\u2019s decision to phase out live sheep exports on the grounds of animal welfare and a loss of social licence by the live export industry \u2013 though Anthony Albanese has promised it would not happen before 2025. While the ban primarily affects Western Australian sheep farmers, Watt said it shouldn\u2019t spell the end of sheep farming but rather \u201cchange how the product is sent to market\u201d. \u201cThe primary motivation, obviously, is an animal welfare consideration. And I think unfortunately for the industry, it lost a lot of public support,\u201d Watt said.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        \u201cWhen you look at the numbers of exports, we\u2019re not not talking about a booming industry, and that, in part, reflects consumer demand changing as well.\u201d He pointed to Labor\u2019s promise of a $500m reconstruction fund to help the regions value add and develop food processing and manufacturing. \u201cEventually it could be used as part of this transition about live sheep exports. Potentially it could be used in the forestry sector to extract the most value from our forestry plantations,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fixed view about you know, exactly what regions or what products that can be used for, but I certainly want to make sure that we use it to lift productivity and ultimately lift jobs in the sector.\u201d Watt said he asked for a position with a connection to regional Australia. Most of his shadow roles had concentrated on regional areas, including portfolios of northern Australia, natural disaster and emergency management. His parents came from the Darling Downs and Mackay regions in Queensland, though he has been Brisbane-based. While the Labor party has its historical roots in the shearers strikes just prior to federation, Watt said he was not unrealistic about the relationship between Labor and the bush. Of Labor\u2019s 77 seats, Labor currently holds 13 seats classified as \u201cprovincial\u201d and six seats classified as \u201crural\u201d by the Australian Electoral Commission. Gilmore, also classified as rural, is still being contested. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that every single person who is living in rural Australia is a potential Labor voter, but I think that being in government gives us a real opportunity to break down some of the misconceptions that exist between the Labor party and rural Australia.\u201d   Related: Breakthrough gene discovery could help prevent disease affecting 10% of world\u2019s crops    Watt said Labor had worked hard to rebuild trust and relationships in regional Australia after previous election losses, particularly the 2019 election. \u201cBeing a Queensland-based senator, I particularly needed to do that, after the wipeout that we suffered in the 2019 election but I feel quite optimistic about our relationships with farm groups and the sector generally, and with rural Australia overall.\u201d But he said Labor had been supportive of the Coalition\u2019s carbon and biodiversity pilot programs - which paid landholders for building carbon sinks and protecting habitat but would visit the trial sites to see how it was working. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive opportunity around the carbon market and reforming things like the emissions reduction fund, so that the average farmer can actually get involved and make a buck out of these sort of things.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Morning Mail: Centrelink staff toilet breaks \u2018timed\u2019, ABC defends unfair dismissal claim, hospital treatment for two royals [2024-01-17T19:51:02Z]": "Morning everyone.

Known as the \u201cbible of the bush\u201d, the Victoria-based News Corp newspaper dedicated to rural and particularly agricultural issues has accused Joyce of \u201cnot reading the play\u201d from the weekend\u2019s election results. \u201cThe lessons for Joyce and co are right before their eyes with increased support for two of their own. Darren Chester in Gippsland and Kevin Hogan in Page, both of whom believe climate change is real,\u201d the editorial says.   Related: Barnaby Joyce signals Nationals could drop support for net zero emissions    \u201cThe climate schism within the Nationals ranks is already playing out with rumblings of a break away from the Liberals and jockeying for party leadership positions. \u201cBut what must happen first is a concession from the deniers that climate change is real and will affect all parts of the country, not just the leafy suburbs of Melbourne and other capital cities.\u201d The intervention from the News Corp-owned masthead comes less than a week before the Nationals leadership ballot. It piles pressure on Joyce, who is facing a split within his party over its future direction, particularly when it comes to the issue of climate change. Former Nationals leader Michael McCormack has not ruled out standing for the leadership and has highlighted the fact that Joyce\u2019s name was actively used in campaign messages against the Coalition in the cities. Chester told The Project he was considering standing as leader because the party\u2019s immediate challenge is to work out how to appeal to younger people and women. He warned the Nationals were a drag on the Liberals\u2019 votes in cities and rejected his leader\u2019s suggestion the party did well to hold all their seats. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a surgeon coming out of the operation saying the operation was a great success but the patient died,\u201d Chester said. \u201cWe lost government on the weekend and that means we lost our capacity to influence policies on behalf of regional Australia who we represent.\u201d Chester said he was currently canvassing support for leadership, though he is unlikely to have the numbers, particularly among National MPs in Queensland.    McCormack and Chester represent a split between south-eastern National MPs who want a softer stance on issues such as climate change and the northern Nationals and LNP members in Queensland, including Joyce, who have been more sceptical. The split \u2013 characterised as the Barnaby Line \u2013 became clear in the election, as Joyce was left off campaign material in Victorian seats such as Nicholls, which delivered a 25% swing in primary votes to a centre-right independent. In a curious piece of timing given the federal leadership debate, Victorian Nationals leader Peter Walsh issued a statement on Tuesday underlining that his state party continued to stand with regional Victorians committed to action on climate change. Walsh told Guardian Australia that climate continued to be one of the key priorities for regional Victorians and the party was currently working on their 2030 targets in conjunction with the state Liberal party. \u201cPeople have different \u2018top of their list\u2019 priorities for federal or state governments. But climate is a consistent one that people want more to be done, but they want it done in a sensible and structured way,\u201d Walsh said. Outgoing resources minister and Queensland MP Keith Pitt said he would back in Joyce as leader and said it was too early look at lessons from the elections while postal votes were still being counted. \u201cUntil that\u2019s finalised I don\u2019t want to get into the debate about which went where. But what we\u2019ve seen is very clear support for people like Kevin Hogan, who\u2019s come through a really tough period of time for him and his people.\u201d Joyce ally Matt Canavan urged his colleagues to declare if they wanted to run for the leadership to be \u201cupfront and honest with people\u201d.

We couldn\u2019t really point out the cost of crazy radical environmental action and because we failed to do that we lost government,\u201d Canavan said. But exit polls done in key marginals found climate and environment policy was the top issue for voters in those electorates. Seats included the Labor-held seat of Gilmore on the New South Wales south coast, Hogan\u2019s seat of Page on the NSW north coast and the Labor-held seat of Eden-Monaro in southern NSW. Gilmore and Eden-Monaro were badly affected by the 2020 bushfires and Page includes Lismore, which was hit by flooding. The polling, conducted for Farmers for Climate Action, found more than 70% of voters considered \u201ceffective climate change\u201d policies important to their vote. Between 42-44% of voters said climate change and environment was in the top three issues informing their vote. The Weekly Times editorial says in spite of Joyce\u2019s \u201cspruiking\u201d that his party held all its seats, it is an inescapable truth that his party lost support all over the country, \u201cthe reason being mixed messaging on the commitment to net zero emissions\u201d. \u201cThe climate change scepticism pedalled by Joyce and senator Matt Canavan played out last year when they were dragged kicking and screaming to a commitment on net zero by 2050,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cIt provided powerful impetus for the teal independents to make successful raids on Coalition held city seats such as Kooyong in Melbourne and Wentworth in Sydney.\u201d", "ChatGPT is coming to Australian schools. Here\u2019s what you need to know [2024-01-22T14:00:04Z]": "ChatGPT will formally be rolled out in all Australian schools for the first time this year after the education ministers\u2019 backing of a framework guiding AI use. From embracing the technology as a learning tool to blanket bans and returning to pen-and-paper exams, the education sector has grappled with how to respond to the chatbot since it was released in late 2022. Now that it\u2019s firmly here to stay, here\u2019s what you need to know about schools in the age of AI. What\u2019s in the framework? The framework, released in December, outlines principles for the use of emergent technologies including privacy and security standards, equity and accessibility. It was developed by the national AI schools taskforce, in consultation with school sectors, education unions, experts and First Nations Australians. As part of the requirements, schools must engage students on how generative AI tools work \u2013 including their \u201cpotential limitations and biases\u201d, with teachers deferred to as \u201csubject-matter experts\u201d in the classroom. Student work, including assessments, needs to outline how generative AI tools should or should not be used, including by ensuring appropriate attribution. The framework also takes note of the ability of AI to support students with disabilities, from diverse backgrounds and in rural and remote communities \u2013 provided it is accessible and equitable.

Every state and territory, excluding South Australia, moved to temporarily restrict ChatGPT in public schools last year as concerns mounted about privacy and plagiarism, while some private schools adopted it in their teaching and services. Since then, the education minister, Jason Clare, has launched an inquiry into the use of generative artificial intelligence, looking into the opportunities and risks it poses to students and teachers.

Early research showed AI could provide intelligent tutoring systems, better personalisation, more targeted learning materials and help educate at-risk students, she said. \u201cThe question will be how do we operationalise [the taskforce] and support teachers and schools to deal with the challenges,\u201d she said. Who is leading the way? South Australia has been a notable national outlier, opting against banning the technology when ChatGPT was released. Its minister for education, training and skills, Blair Boyer, told Guardian Australia schools would be doing young people an \u201cincredible disservice\u201d if it didn\u2019t educate students about the appropriate use of AI. \u201cAI will be a part of our work and lives in the future,\u201d he said. Since ChatGPT\u2019s release, South Australia\u2019s Department of Education has developed a generative AI chatbot app which uses the same language model as the tool with built-in safeguards to protect students\u2019 privacy and avoid inappropriate content. EdChat, being tested at 16 public schools, doesn\u2019t save students\u2019 input or use it to learn from, unlike ChatGPT. The trial is being used to inform how AI will be implemented into the state\u2019s curriculum and was shared in the creation of Australia\u2019s framework. Are other states and territories on board? Queensland has also completed a small trial in state high schools that piloted an AI teaching and learning tool called Cerego among 500 students. The adaptive learning platform, which uses AI to create quiz-based learning that adjusts to the needs of individual students, will be released to all state schools later in 2024. Victoria was one of the first states and territories to lift its restriction to access ChatGPT, scrapping it in term two last year. A spokesperson for the state\u2019s Department of Education said any use of AI in the curriculum would be determined by schools within the \u201coverarching principles\u201d of safe and ethical use. Tasmania is similarly preparing its own policy, procedures and materials for the 2024 school year, noting the latest version of the Australian curriculum includes means to integrate the teaching of AI. Western Australia has been considering AI trials held in other states to streamline lesson planning, marking and assessment developments and reduce teacher workloads. It has pointed out the ability for AI to automate jobs like excursion planning, meeting preparation and writing general correspondence. The Australian Capital Territory is taking a \u201ccautious approach\u201d, noting the continued risks of algorithmic bias and unauthorised use of student data by tech companies. \u201cOur current priority is to establish a robust educational framework, to guide teachers in how students use AI tools responsibly,\u201d an ACT education directorate spokesperson said. The secretary of the New South Wales education department, Murat Dizdar, said the state was committed to national collaboration and actively involved in discussions to prepare learners for a future where \u201cgenerative AI is part of everyday life\u201d. What risks remain? Leslie Loble, a UTS academic and former deputy secretary in the NSW education department, said while the \u201cshock\u201d of ChatGPT\u2019s emergence had worn off, the issues surrounding generative AI were \u201cby no means settled and resolved\u201d. \u201cGoing from seven states banning it to now is a sign of how far schools and systems have come in understanding the potential benefits and risks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we really have to get started on clearer standards and expectations for what AI should deliver and how it should be defined and governed.\u201d She said the framework was an \u201cexcellent foundation\u201d but key risks remained \u2013 particularly the persistent problem of equity and the digital divide. \u201cA lot of students still aren\u2019t getting the basics of computers and wifi,\u201d she said, pointing to funding gaps between government and independent schools in terms of resourcing.   Related: Machine learning: could ChatGPT become just another tool for Australia\u2019s year 12 \u2013 like Wikipedia?    \u201cThere\u2019s a clear gap in take-up of these sophisticated generative AI tools between households and schools that have resources and those that don\u2019t. \u201cTo the extent these technologies can have a positive impact on learning \u2013 that divide is deeply troubling and will lead to a learning gap getting even worse.\u201d While Australia\u2019s framework succeeded on a global scale in connecting AI to teaching and learning, Loble said the worst case would be to \u201cset and forget\u201d without consistently anchoring AI in teacher-led programs. \u201cThat means investment in professional learning and support,\u201d she said. \u201cTeacher workload is enormous and growing but if we don\u2019t start to provide much better information about these tools, AI will end up increasing teacher workload because it will fall to them to decide [how to use it]. \u201cIt\u2019s a potential workload shift we can\u2019t afford right now.\u201d", "Land clearing at Queensland\u2019s Deebing Creek angers Indigenous protesters [2022-10-28T08:11:20Z]": "Clearing has begun on land in south-eastern Queensland upon which Indigenous protesters claim the bones of their ancestors lay and an unrecognised massacre took place. Bulldozers on the former Deebing Creek Aboriginal reserve were halted on Friday, however, when the protesters held a smoking ceremony on the site on Ipswich\u2019s southern outskirts.

But the bush surrounding these protected areas is slated for development, despite claims by some First Nations people that it is culturally significant and harbours the remains of their ancestors More than 140 hectares of the former Aboriginal reserve is in the hands of several developers, among them Stockland, which began bulldozing trees on Wednesday in order to build about 2,300 houses over the next 10 to 15 years.    A Stockland spokesperson said the company \u201cdeeply respects the history of the area\u201d and has \u201cvalued the time taken to engage\u201d traditional owners.

Brisbane councillor Jonathan Sriranganathan, who was at the ceremony, disputed claims that Aboriginal owners had consented to the development.    \u201cThe current native title framework does not give Aboriginal people the power to say \u2018no\u2019 and veto developments like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may have to sign a cultural heritage management plan in order to extract some concessions through negotiations, but whether those groups might have signed a CHMP or not doesn\u2019t mean that they are consenting to and supportive of a development.\u201d   Related: First Nations children account for 84% of Queensland youth detainees put in solitary confinement    Sriranganathan said the land clearing was \u201ca disgusting attack\u201d on both the ecosystem of Deebing Creek and First Nations land rights.

Documents obtained by Guardian Australia predict Queensland and New South Wales will bear the brunt of that shortfall, with each needing more than 1,700 teachers by 2025. Teachers and union representatives warned they were facing what one described as the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of booming enrolments, an ageing workforce and a mismatch in the type of educators required compared to those coming out of university. Even as most states and territories were expected to not have enough secondary teachers, a glut of more than 8,000 primary school teachers was predicted across Australia by 2025. The modelling \u2013 completed by the federal department of education and circulated to state and territory education ministers \u2013 shows a 25% decline in Queensland\u2019s high school teaching graduates over a five-year period to 2025. Secondary school enrolments are forecast to rise by 13% in the same period. But a spokesperson for Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, disputed the predictions.   Related: The Gonski \u2018failure\u2019: why did it happen and who is to blame for the \u2018defrauding\u2019 of public schools?    The spokesperson said the Queensland government statistician\u2019s office figures show enrolments across state schools will increase 4.4% between 2021 and 2026. Modelling by the state government was also said to show there will be enough teachers to meet enrolment growth. \u201cWe made a commitment at the last election to employ 6,190 new teachers and 1,139 new teacher aides over the next four years, and we are on track to meet that commitment,\u201d Grace said. \u201cThis is in addition to the more than 6,000 new teachers we have employed since 2015, as well as more than 1,500 new teacher aides.\u201d Teachers at public and private schools across Queensland \u2013 who wished not to be named as they were not authorised to speak about their work \u2013 said they were buckling under increasing workloads.  One department head at a large state school in southeast Queensland said he and his staff were \u201ctotally overworked\u201d. The teacher has almost two decades experience, and said he was now \u201cstruggling to get through every day\u201d. \u201cTeachers are wanting to walk away in droves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are totally over it.\u201d He said his roughly 10 teachers were struggling with stress and anxiety, swamped under an \u201cimmense workload\u201d that was oriented towards \u201cbusiness goals\u201d not \u201cstudent outcomes\u201d.

It found one in three teachers aged under 30 intended to leave over the coming 10 years. Beyond the south-east, schools, stories have emerged of at least one regional school seconding school administrators to fill a gap in teacher numbers, something one teacher said was \u201cunheard of\u201d.

In the 12 months to last June, more than 30,000 people moved to Queensland from interstate \u2013 almost the equivalent to adding a city the size of Gladstone in a year. \u201cThe state government is doing a good job of building schools in the metro growth corridors, but they need to focus on encouraging teachers to outback and more rural areas,\u201d Richardson said. As well as reducing workloads, teachers say increasing pay and locality allowances would help make the career more desirable. In all, more than 4,000 extra high school teachers nationwide are needed over the next four years to meet demand, according to federal government modelling.   Related: International researchers shun Australia after government vetoing of grants, expert says    South Australia is projected to fall more than 1,100 high school teachers short of its needs in 2025, Western Australia will have a dearth of 900 and the Northern Territory be short more than 100 high school teachers. Victoria was forecast to have a surplus of almost 1,000 teachers, Tasmania about 200 more than needed and the ACT was forecast to roughly match its high school teaching requirements. The Department of Education said the acting federal education minister, Stuart Robert, had \u201cled discussions at education ministers meetings to better understand teacher workforce issues across the country\u201d.

Patients who are bulk billed do not pay anything for their consult, with GPs billing the government directly through Medicare instead. As of Wednesday, GPs began receiving triple the government rebate to bulk bill concession card holders and children under 16 for most standard consultations. The incentive has risen from $6.85 to $20.65 in metro areas, and from $13.15 to $39.65 in very remote areas.   Related: Higher Medicare rebates will not cure broken system that rewards \u2018speed, not need\u2019, report says    The federal health minister, Mark Butler, said on Wednesday at a press conference announcing the start of the incentives that he had heard from general practices that had moved away from bulk billing that \u201cthey were intending to return to bulk billing\u201d due to the increased rebate. \u201cAnd for those feeling a need to reconsider their ongoing bulk billing practices, they\u2019ve reaffirmed their commitment to do it in the long term,\u201d he said.

The proportion who answered \u201cyes\u201d was 15%, with the remainder \u201cunsure\u201d. A GP working in rural NSW told Guardian Australia: \u201cAs a practice, we are not planning on changing our billing practices. \u201c[Moving] to a more private billing model took a considerable amount of effort to change culture and patient expectations and [their] sense of entitlement [to have their visit bulk billed],\u201d he said. \u201cI am concerned that if we go back to bulk billing and undo the hard work we have done, when funding once again fails to keep up with inflation we will need to stop bulk billing again and go through the re-education and abuse again.\u201d Meanwhile, the Australian Medical Association on Wednesday recommended doctors raise their fees for a third time in 2023 to keep pace with rising costs, increasing the costs of non-bulk billed appointments.

This concern will only continue to be perpetuated through the current, restrictive triple bulk billing incentive criteria.\u201d The health program director at the Grattan Institute, Peter Breadon, said while the bulk billing incentive increase was likely to help slow and, in some areas, reverse the decline in bulk billing, other policies were needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve argued for a blended funding model that has more funding for patients with complex health needs, and who have lower incomes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s designed well, this would help increase bulk billing for people who need it most, including those who don\u2019t have concession cards but still struggle to pay fees \u2026 many of which are in disadvantaged areas where bulk billing is needed most.\u201d", "Caroline Jones: groundbreaking Australian journalist and champion of women in media [2022-05-27T20:00:13Z]": "The twinkling eyes and mellifluous voice of Caroline Jones belied the grief and loss underpinning what she called \u201ca gift\u201d that made her an attentive listener who connected profoundly with people experiencing hardship.

She won a Logie award for a hard-hitting series about Sydney\u2019s slumlords and their tenants, but learned a difficult lesson in the process. \u201cI imagined that [my reporting] would change things for the better \u2026 Some of the tenants were evicted [as a result]. I felt it was a great failure on our part and a hard lesson,\u201d Jones said in a 2013 interview.    So, too, the warmth of her personality. She had grace and poise, sheer class, oodles of style. We used to call her &quot;Matron,&quot; a joke she genuinely enjoyed. She had no hesitation in hosing down the testosterone, but never with malice.&mdash; Mike Carlton (@MikeCarlton01) May 21, 2022    Jones\u2019s mother took her own life in 1969, an event that deeply affected the young journalist. It sent her on a lifelong quest to find meaning in the world, and revealed her life\u2019s purpose. \u201cMy newly awakened compassion, born of suffering, was still only embryonic but it was a gift because it enabled me to listen to people and, at times, it allowed me to be close to another person in trouble,\u201d she wrote in her memoir An Authentic Life.   Related: Bill Peach: farewell to a much-loved Australian character    In 1972 Jones became the story when it was announced she would be the first woman to host Four Corners. Unprepared for the resulting furore, she let herself be photographed wearing a miniskirt and applying lipstick. The photo appeared on the front page of a Melbourne newspaper under the headline \u201cBrains Now, Beauty Next\u201d. Ironically, that front page is now a reminder of the barriers Jones helped to dismantle. Jones took most delight in her work with Women in Media. She joined the organisation as co-patron in 2017, and a year later the Caroline Jones Women in Media Young Journalist\u2019s Award was launched. The annual award aims to provide an opportunity for female regional and rural journalists to experience the media and political landscape of Canberra first-hand in a supportive mentoring environment. Jones threw herself into supporting the young journalists and caring for them as though they were family. One pregnant Queenslander heading to Canberra in winter received a package of thermal underwear in the mail, another was sent money to help with babysitting. Jones was born in Sydney on 1 January 1938, the only child of Nancy and Brian James. After her father left home to serve in the second world war, Jones and her mother moved to the New South Wales country town of Murrurundi to live with a grandmother and aunt until he returned. Jones\u2019s grandfather, Ashley Pountney, had been editor of some of the first newspapers in north-western NSW and Jones always felt she had \u201cink in her blood\u201d, but it was not until her mid-20s that she secured a position with the ABC in Canberra. Jones worked as presenter of Radio National\u2019s Search for Meaning, interviewing a range of diverse people across the nation. The program led to Australian Story, which she hosted until retirement in 2016, although she continued to tweet about it with viewers on Monday nights. Jones wrote a series of books based on the radio program and explored the emotions around her father\u2019s death in her last book, Through a Glass Darkly. Jones became a cherished and respected mentor and friend to many young female journalists in regional and rural communities. Recipients of the award in her name have expressed nothing but admiration for the way she nurtured and supported them, and often their children too. Elly Bradfield, a Queensland regional reporter and recipient of the 2020 award, said: \u201cOne of the saddest things Caroline ever said to me was that back in her day, you had no choice; you either had a family or a career but you couldn\u2019t have both. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that I want to stay in the regions but there aren\u2019t a lot of incentives to do that. Caroline\u2019s support helped me to realise the importance of what we are doing. She was almost a cheerleader from the sidelines and had a real soft spot for regional journalists. She lifted us up and always made the time for us.\u201d Others also benefited from Jones\u2019s generosity. She taught primary school children in western Sydney how to read and was personally invested in Mahboba\u2019s Promise, a charity helping Afghan women and children. In 1988 Jones was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for her contribution to radio and television journalism. Jones married and divorced in her early 20s and had no children, yet her legacy is indelibly stamped on a generation of young women in the media. Part of the Women in Media prize is the opportunity to ask the first question at the National Press Club, and a highlight for winners was to see Jones beaming from the front row, watching with pride as the question was delivered. As 2022\u2019s winner, Brooke Littlewood from Western Australia, was announced at the Press Club this week, a bunch of flowers was placed on Jones\u2019s empty chair. \u2022 Caroline Jones, journalist; born 1 January 1938, died 20 May 2022", "Most wild dogs killed across rural Australia are pure dingoes, DNA research says [2022-04-05T17:30:01Z]": "Angus Emmott counted 19 dogs strung up by their tails on four trees within 50 metres of the main tourist road between Winton and Lark Quarry in western Queensland, their golden coats set off against a clear blue sky. Last week, the grazier received test results confirming the animals he spotted hanging on a single evening in May 2021 were pure dingo, not wild dog hybrids. Dr Kylie Cairns, a specialist in conservation genetics at the University of New South Wales, said the results for the dogs\u2019 DNA samples were a 99.99% dingo match \u2013 the highest available for the modelling.   Interactive   While scientific, Indigenous and agricultural knowledge are increasingly converging towards the need to protect dingoes for their ecological and cultural value, Cairns says the dogs\u2019 slaughter comes down to a matter of wording. The government-endorsed National Wild Dog Action Plan defines wild dogs as \u201call wild-living dogs, which include: dingoes, feral dogs and their hybrids.\u201d The plan, a livestock industry-driven initiative, provides a framework for landholders to participate in a range of control measures \u201cemphasising humane, safe and effective management techniques\u201d. A spokesperson from the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions told Guardian Australia it provides wild dog best-practice management information to land managers that is \u201cunderpinned by scientific evidence,\u201d including \u201ctrapping, ground shooting, ground baiting, aerial baiting, canid pest ejectors, exclusion and cluster fencing and guardian animals\u201d. On Monday, Australia\u2019s minister for the environment, Sussan Ley, and the minister for agriculture, David Littleproud, announced $800,000 to extend the national feral animal coordinators program to June 2023, including the National Wild Dog Management Coordinator project, in partnership with Australian Wool Innovation.    Cairns\u2019 research shows dingo cross dog hybridisation is much less common than previously thought. Tests of 5,039 wild dog DNA samples from across Australia found 64% were pure dingos and a further 20% were more than 75% dingo. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a strong result for telling us that feral dogs are not an established pest population in the wild in Australia,\u201d Cairns said. The results don\u2019t surprise Sonya Takau, a Jirrbal rainforest Aboriginal woman, who knows \u201ca domestic dog can\u2019t survive in the bush\u201d. \u201cWe have a saying amongst our mob, if it looks like a dingo and it acts like a dingo, it is a dingo.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        Cairns said \u201chybridisation has been used as justification for lethal control\u201d but she believed protecting pure dingoes from mixing with wild dogs was not the primary reason for the killing of the animals. \u201cI think livestock predation has always been the primary justification, but hybridisation was a convenient alternative reason,\u201d Cairns said. Greg Mifsud is a wildlife ecologist employed as national wild dog management coordinator by the Centre for Invasive Species Solutions. He says the killing of a native species like the dingo is not a concern. \u201cManagement is based around managing the impacts, so regardless of what the dog might be, if it\u2019s causing impact to either agriculture or even a biodiversity asset, such as an endangered species, then we need to control it,\u201d Mifsud said. However, Barry Traill, a conservationist, says graziers are increasingly seeing the benefits of \u201csimply doing nothing\u201d to the dingoes.   Related: \u2018Dingoes were here first\u2019: the landowners who say letting \u2018wild dogs\u2019 live pays dividends    Traill says the dingo has an important role in the food chain as the apex predator in keeping the ecosystem in balance by, for example, reducing the impact of feral goats and kangaroos on vegetation. This in turn means healthier coverage of vegetation and grass, which benefit the livestock. Traill says that as a medium-sized dog weighing only around 15kg, dingoes are not designed to attack cattle. He says that while sheep and goats are vulnerable, more resources need to be employed for non-lethal methods of protection such as fences and guard animals. Despite growing up in an environment where \u201ceveryone used to carry a rifle and would shoot at every dingo they saw,\u201d Emmott is one of the graziers learning to live with dingoes.    He believes the use of poisons, such as the common 1080 bait, only make the dingo problem worse as they destroy the animals\u2019 natural hierarchal structure. By killing the alpha male and females, Emmott believes it makes young dingoes more likely to harm livestock, \u201ca bit like a mob of teenagers gathering down at the beach and creating mayhem and havoc\u201d. However, he says public perception in the outback remains a problem. \u201cPeople cop a lot of flack, they wouldn\u2019t be game to go down to the pub if they admitted they\u2019re not killing dingoes, because there\u2019s a lot of peer group pressure to conform to the way we\u2019ve always done. But the way we\u2019ve always done it isn\u2019t working,\u201d Emmott said. In a bid to change public perception, Emmott was one of the creators of a lobby group, Landholders for Dingoes, established two years ago to spread and normalise their message.  Takau last year created Dingo Culture, a First Nations initiative to protect the culturally significant totem species. When Takau sees dingoes hung up on trees \u201cmy heart breaks\u201d. \u201cAs an Aboriginal person, we see them as our family,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m driving along and I see a dingo I pull over, because it\u2019s an honour to see that\u2019s one of my ancestors there. It could be my grandmother, it could be my grandfather, could be any one of our old people.\u201d   Related:NSW plan for Kosciuszko feral horses a threat to endangered freshwater fish    Takau says the current situation allowing the indiscriminate killing of dingoes could see the dingoes go the way of the thylacine.  She understands farmers have to make a living, but science is also showing dingoes and farmers can co-exist. \u201cThis is where Aboriginal knowledge and western science works well together. When you combine the two, there\u2019s solutions there.\u201d Littleproud and Ley said pest and species coordinators exist to bring stakeholders together \u201cto coordinate best practice management of threats and to facilitate the best overall environmental outcome\u201d. \u201cThe stakeholders include landholders, community groups and First Nations\u2019 people,\u201d the ministers said in a joint statement. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 April 2022 to clarify the information given to land managers about the National Wild Dog Action Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cwild dogs\u201d.

His property would fit into the average Queensland farm more than 5,300 times and he can afford to relax \u2013 there are no fences to mend or animals to feed and his crops are impervious to the vagaries of the weather. Davis is an exotic mushroom grower, his pocket-sized farm in the equally diminutive town of Harrisville, south-west of Ipswich, a repurposed lawn bowls club. The former cafe owner started growing mushrooms at home for family and friends. \u201cI spent five or six years studying mushroom growing and learning everything I could from reading books, and watching YouTube and Facebook videos and just connecting with people and asking questions,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen this unique property came up for sale, I thought it would be perfect for commercial growing.\u201d A former second world war army barracks, the property once housed soldiers stationed at Archerfield airport before being redeployed as Harrisville District Bowls Club in the 1950s, quickly becoming the social heart of the small rural community. But with an ageing membership, the club folded in 2016, the once immaculately-trimmed green consumed by weeds and bindi patches. Sold and used for storage, it was back on the market in 2020, a serendipitous time for Davis, who jumped at the opportunity to progress his hobby into a business.    Now, with Scenic Rim Mushrooms, he sells pink oysters and freckled chestnuts grown in temperature-controlled rooms to some of the region\u2019s top restaurants as well as visitors who cross the old bowling green to his \u201cfarmgate\u201d shop. \u201cLook, I think if you\u2019re passionate about something and if the business plan makes sense, then you should just go for it because we only get one life and you\u2019ve got to have a crack, you know?\u201d he says. Bigger isn\u2019t always better Davis\u2019s operation is emblematic of a new generation of small-scale farmers being welcomed into semi-rural Queensland communities. These farming first-timers are happy to take advice while also seeking to do things differently, with diversified income streams and a greater focus on sustainability. Nick Holliday worked in a law firm, as a union organiser and as an air-conditioning technician before buying Belvedere Farm, north-west of Brisbane, in 2014.   Related: Australian farm revolution: hopes and fears as a new workforce replaces backpackers    His intention initially was to live on the property and commute to his job. \u201cBut once I started raising cattle and chickens, I became deeply interested in the idea of feeding people, as well as using livestock to building soil organic matter,\u201d he says. In addition to their own eight hectares, Holliday and his wife, Brydie, now lease another 60, still well below the average farm size in Australia of 4,300 hectares. The couple practise agro-ecological farming, using temporary fencing and feeding troughs to rotate cattle around different pastures every day, followed by the chickens, to further aerate and naturally fertilise the soil. On their leased land, an old dairy farm, they\u2019re using pigs to clear lantana and regenerate the degraded soil.    To ensure a regular income, the Hollidays operate Belvedere Farm via community-supported agriculture (CSA). Their subscribers buy into the farm\u2019s projected harvest for a set period, receiving monthly deliveries of pork, beef and pastured eggs. Davis, too, has incorporated a subscription model into his business plan, albeit for different reasons. With demand for his Lion\u2019s Mane mushrooms, appreciated for their medicinal as well as culinary benefits, greater than he\u2019s able to supply, his subscribers get first dibs. These loyal customers appreciate the operation\u2019s light environmental footprint, with power for the temperature-controlled rooms provided by solar panels, minimal water use and the mushrooms grown on sawdust, a byproduct of the milling industry. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for our conscience \u2013 restaurants are really wanting products and producers that are sustainable these days,\u201d Davis says. Hungry to learn While both the hands-in-soil and the business end of farming can be a sharp and sometimes devastatingly cruel learning curve, both Davis and Holliday have been gratified by the support they\u2019ve received. \u201cThere\u2019s a really awesome movement of new farmers,\u201d Holliday says. \u201cFirst generation farmers \u2013 young people who are undertaking these practices and there are some great mentors, particularly holistic management educators who have adapted methods to an Australian context. We\u2019ve been very lucky to have the opportunity to learn off a lot of other really good farmers.\u201d Davis says the local council, keen to attract tourism to the region, has also provided business development courses and mentorship programs. Jo Sheppard, CEO of Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation, says many young farmers are \u201cenjoying the diversity modern farming can offer\u201d. This includes \u201cthe opportunity to create a sustainable farming enterprise through efficient production, strategic investment decisions and diversification into emerging areas such as agritourism and natural capital.\u201d Kate Keating is the south-east Queensland co-ordinator for Young Farmers Connect, a national not-for-profit network that provides resources and peer support for young farmers. She says small-scale farming is on the increase and proving a boon for the communities they settle in as well as consumers.    \u201cThey\u2019re fostering strong relationships between grower and consumer and educating people on the true value of food and in doing so, bringing a sense of connection back to our local communities and cities,\u201d she says. For Kate Creasey, of Olive View Estate, the career transition from event producer and vintage makeup artist to olive farmer necessitated a hasty education in horticulture. \u201cWhen we moved here, the trees were drought-affected and hadn\u2019t fruited for a couple of years. The previous owner had just sort of lost heart.\u201d But with lots of advice and support, she and her father have managed to double the size of the trees and had two successful fruitings since buying the farm together 18 months ago, she says. \u201cThe first season, there were heaps, but they were very small fruit. This year we have a smaller crop, but the fruit is absolutely massive, plumped up with all that extra rain and nutrition. We\u2019ve actually had other growers message us to ask us how we got them so big.\u201d Creasey\u2019s not putting all her eggs (or olives) in one basket though. Like a growing number of farmers, she\u2019s mitigating risk with agritourism, a sector projected by the Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation to be worth a potential $4.5 billion by 2030. Like Davis, she has a \u201cfarmgate stall\u201d, a quaint 1950 Morris bus, formerly used as a broadcast bus for the Melbourne Olympics, restored by her vintage-loving (and olive-loathing) father where she sells jars of olives, tapenades, oil and more.    She\u2019s also using her events experience to host weddings and other celebrations in the picturesque olive grove and has renovated a cottage on the property to run as an Airbnb. One thing stopping more people embracing a life on the land is often the start-up capital required to purchase property. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very fortunate that I owned this land before the price of land around here accelerated out of the reach of a farmer,\u201d Holliday says. However, QFF says it is increasingly seeing out-of-the-box solutions such as share farming or, as the Hollidays are doing, leasing more land. Demand for Belvedere\u2019s eggs is so great the couple are looking to expand their flock from 300 to 1,000 hens. But while the business is growing exponentially, their life goals remain modest. \u201cWe have no aspirations to control huge tracts of land or buy a Maserati,\u201d Holliday says. \u201cWe just want to have good jobs and pay ourselves a decent white-collar salary, feed people and heal the country.\u201d", "Some voters in regional Australia could face hours-long drives to cast their federal election vote [2022-05-19T07:15:32Z]": "Regional communities are concerned they will have to travel for hours to cast their vote on Saturday, as the Australian Electoral Commission makes a last-ditch effort to fill staffing gaps so polling places can open. \nThe administration of this year\u2019s election has been hampered by labour shortages, which have been compounded by further staffing shortages due to Covid, with 90 workers calling in sick with the virus within 24 hours in Hobart. \nThe AEC said in the past day more than 5,000 people had signed up to work on polling day in the electorates in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland that were facing staff shortages. \n \n  Related: Australian election 2022 voters\u2019 guide: everything you need to know, including how to vote if you have Covid  \n \n\u201cThe new registrations mean some of the locations we identified yesterday are no longer of critical concern but others are still falling short and, given the current environment, there could be new areas of concern arise,\u201d digital engagement director at AEC Evan Ekin-Smyth said. \n\u201cHowever, the impact will be limited. We will have the absolute vast majority of the 7,000 polling places we operate across the nation on election day open and operating as per usual.\u201d \nThe AEC said it was doing everything it could to ensure every polling place was staffed on Saturday, including approaching the Australian defence force to enlist the help of the reserves, police and emergency services personnel. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nThere has been a last-minute callout for workers over social media and public servants are being urged to help out, with rules around holding another job waived so they can take part. \nIt was expected that 76 booths across regional and remote Australia would not open on Saturday, although that number has become unclear. \nThe key seats of concern were: Capricornia, Flynn, Kennedy and Leichhardt in Queensland, Barker and Grey in SA, and Durack and O\u2019Connor in WA. \nIn some of those electorates, community members were racing to find their own staff to work. \nDianne Const and her husband run the roadhouse in King Lake, a small farming town in the eastern region of WA.

They need one more to open, and they are \u201cnot 100% sure\u201d if they will get there. \nShe said the town would have about 100 voters, and if the polling booth doesn\u2019t open in King Lake, everyone will have to drive 50 minutes to the next one. \n\u201cThis is what happens in the bush and with Covid it\u2019s worse.

The First Nations campaign director at GetUp, Amy Gordon, said it would amount \u201cto voter suppression\u201d. \n\u201cThe affected electorates have the highest Aboriginal votes in the country, and plans should have been in place to make sure their polling booths were fully staffed,\u201d Gordon said. \n\u201cOur local volunteers on the ground in the Cape York peninsula this week have seen how people really want to have a say on issues like remote housing, health in communities and cultural heritage.\u201d \nThe AEC said the vast majority of the nation\u2019s planned 7,000 polling places will be open. \n\u201cPeople are taking advantage of the options the Australian election system makes available \u2013 pre-poll, postal, remote mobile votes, couriered overseas votes, in-person overseas votes and even telephone voting are all being utilised by those eligible to do so,\u201d Ekin-Smyth said. \n\u201cFor those areas of concern, people are putting their hand up to help deliver democracy in their community, which is great, but we need more.\u201d", "\u2018No longer useful\u2019: the dark history of Australia\u2019s post-war Asian deportations [2024-03-30T23:00:21Z]": "The White Australia policy was behind thousands of deportations, many of them illegal, which took place at the end of the second world war. Families were torn apart, Australian-born women were stripped of their citizenship and Asian-born men who had served in the Australian armed forces were ordered to leave the country they had fought for. It is a part of Australia\u2019s dark history that has been largely buried for decades. Forgetting is crucial to the creation of a nation, 19th-century French philosopher Ernest Renan once observed. Now, 150 years on, another Ernest on the other side of the world is exhuming the buried history of government-enforced racism, often implemented in the face of public resistance.   Related: How immigration changed Australia \u2013 an interactive journey through history    A research paper will be published by Ernest Koh, a historian specialising in south-east Asian history, later this year, with a book to follow. The University of Canberra academic\u2019s work was part of research led by the CNA TV network in Singapore, which resulted in a documentary, The Exiles: Australia\u2019s Asian Deportations. The documentary has been screened in Singapore and broadcast by PBS America in the UK, but is yet to be screened in Australia. Three years ago, Koh was engaged by CNA to research Chinese merchant sailors living in north-west England who were recruited into the British merchant navy in the 1940s. The Royal Merchant Navy\u2019s mariners numbered about 150,000 when war broke out in Europe, and about 8% were Chinese recruits. These seamen played a vital role in Britain\u2019s warfare, but were deported at the war\u2019s conclusion. During the research, Koh came across archival material suggesting a similar scenario took place in Australia. \u201c[We were] trying to find out what happened to these Chinese sailors from Liverpool who were deported to Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong,\u201d Koh says. \u201cWhat I found instead were all these newspaper reports and parliament papers about these Asian men from Australia who were being deported, in many instances with their Australian wives and children, to Singapore, to Malaya, as the colony was referred to at the time. The Chifley government didn\u2019t really know what to do with them either.\u201d    Koh and the CNA team tracked down the descendants of some of these ex-servicemen, adding oral histories to his bank of research. What he recorded was a pattern of intergenerational trauma. With the creation of new nation-states across Asia after the war, many of the sailors had become effectively stateless, and had been deported by the Australian government to countries they had no connection to. \u201cThe act of removing someone and placing them in another place where they don\u2019t belong has all these horrible effects that go on for generations,\u201d Koh says. Seaman Tony Ang Kai Ming, who carried more than two hundred European women and child refugees to Australia from Penang after the Japanese invasion of Malaya in 1941, went on to serve in the Australian army before being recruited by the US army as a foreman for its Civil Construction Corps based in Brisbane. It was there he met his future wife, 19-year-old shop assistant Marjorie Pettit.    When Ang received his deportation orders in 1949 the couple had three Australian-born sons. Although from mainland China, Ang and his family were deported to Hong Kong, where the family lived in squalor in the Walled City in Kowloon. Youngest son Kerry Ang told the Guardian his Australian mother\u2019s deportation to Hong Kong left her permanently traumatised, with a deep-seated fear of authority. \u201cBut she just refused to talk about any of it,\u201d says Ang, today a high school history teacher in Melbourne.    \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe really, I\u2019ve spoken about it with some of my classes and \u2026 they find it really difficult to even believe it ever happened, that a government could just use people and then when they\u2019re no longer useful, get rid of them because they don\u2019t fit into a white Anglo-Saxon racial group.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Mavis Ada Anderson was a 17-year-old Sydney waitress when she met Abdul Samad Amjah, who had arrived in Fremantle on the SS Klang after the siege of Singapore a year earlier.

Amjah received his notice to leave Australia in October 1947. Mavis, born in the south Sydney suburb of Sans Souci, learned at this time the Australian government had reclassified her as an alien. She was pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child. Both Amjah and the Ang family managed to eventually gain re-admittance to Australia. \u201cA lot of the Chinese [people] dad worked with didn\u2019t fight it, they just did what they were told and left,\u201d Kerry Ang says. \u201cBut he was married, he had his Australian wife and three kids, and he fought against it.\u201d In his own research, Ang found records of Australia\u2019s first minister for immigration, Arthur Calwell discussing his father\u2019s case. \u201cCalwell was arguing that dad really wasn\u2019t in the Australian Army \u2026 and we know that\u2019s not true because we\u2019ve got his Australian Service Medal.\u201d    In September 1948, the Singapore-based Amjah signed on as crew on the SS Marella, and upon reaching Sydney deserted the ship to re-join his family. He avoided immigration authorities for three months and was subsequently charged with being a prohibited immigrant. Both men\u2019s cases captured media attention. Several of the women who were married to Chinese sailors formed the Australian Wives of Chinese Deportees\u2019 Association. Koh says their strategy was simple: \u201cKeep the story in the newspapers, focus on the Australian-born children and on the war service performed by their husbands in defence of Australia.\u201d   Related: \u2018Fight for every other refugee\u2019: Priya Nadesalingam on what Australia can learn from Biloela    Like events that would unfold in the small rural town of Biloela in Queensland decades later, public sentiment, Koh says, was turning. \u201cA lot of the pushback actually came from not the sailors themselves, but from the community who rallied around the wives,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have the churches, the unions and even the RSL all telling the media the same thing \u2013 they\u2019ve earned their right to stay here through war service, they have families, they have children. Let them stay.\u201d    Carol Marshman, one of Abdul Samad Amjah\u2019s daughters, told the Guardian if it wasn\u2019t for the support of the RSL and the World Council of Churches, she may have never seen her father again. \u201cIt turned out that because my father could speak English, [immigration authorities] gave him the compulsory dictation test in French,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t what finally won him the case. That test had to be given to immigrants within a five year period, and my father\u2019s test happened a few weeks after that period, so legally, they should never have deported him in the first place. \u201cHe won on a legal technicality, rather than on any point of justice.\u201d    Koh says as many as 20,000 Asian refugees and mariners arrived in Australia in the aftermath of the Japanese conquest of south-east Asia. But unlike their European counterparts, once the war ended most of the Asian immigrants were ordered to leave, and many mixed Asian and Australian families were never able to return. When US navy seaman Ahmad bin Osman was ordered to leave Sydney in 1947, his Australian wife, Phyllis Frater, left for Singapore with him. But the government would not allow her to bring her three children from a previous marriage with an Australian man, who had played no role in their upbringing.    The children were placed in an orphanage and she never saw them again. Australian navy seaman Jacob Abdullah and his Torres Strait Islander wife, Mercia, were deported with their four Australian-born children in 1948. Like a number of Australians who accompanied their husbands back to Asia, Mercia succumbed to malaria in Singapore the same year. Five years later, Abdullah died, and the children, now numbering five, were rejected by his family. They spent a period living on the streets before being placed in foster care, continuing a pattern of abuse that left lifelong scars. With a prewar population of less than 7 million, Australia was never going to be capable of sourcing all its war effort from an exclusively white population. It was not the only country in such a position. By the war\u2019s end, Koh says, it is estimated nearly 30,000 Chinese sailors were serving on US vessels across Europe and the Pacific.    It was not uncommon for a Japanese warship to be attacked by a US vessel crewed by Chinese, Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese recruits. \u201cBut the second world war became the bedrock for postwar, nationalist creation stories, and this racial diversity has become a lost history,\u201d says Koh. \u201cWhen we think about who was fighting to defend Australia at the time, the enduring images of the second world war are very stereotypical. \u201cIn the retellings of the second world war, its armies are almost always of a single colour, such is the monochromatic nature of second world war histories.\u201d While forgetting may be crucial to the creation of a nation, Australia cannot deny that there was a \u201cbanal cruelty\u201d with the racially motivated deportations that followed the deadliest war in history, Koh says. \u201cFor all of its progressiveness, post WWII was not simply a celebratory watershed moment in Australian immigration history. It had a darker side to it.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2024. A previous version said Kerry Ang lived in Brisbane, rather than Melbourne. It was further amended on 5 April 2024 to make clear that Ernest Koh\u2019s research was initiated by the CNA TV network, and to correct the credits for two of the images.", "Potholes, warped rail lines and washed-away roads: flood-hit regions face infrastructure crisis [2022-11-27T14:00:09Z]": "Just outside the flood-affected town of Condobolin, the rail line that helps connect Sydney to Perth is suspended mid-air. The hanging track is warped, dropping and rising like a carnival ride.

Cars have to slow to a crawl to navigate parts of the 100km/h road, and many of the dirt roads that connect it to properties to the north and south are either closed entirely or extensively damaged.   Related: Flood could cut off NSW town of Moulamein \u2018through December\u2019, authorities say    The situation is replicated all over the south-east of the country, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, where flooding and heavy rains have caused immense damage to infrastructure critical to rural Australia. In NSW alone, the government estimates a staggering 10,000 kilometres of road have been affected by flood and rain damage, an early estimate only expected to worsen. Many of the state\u2019s roads are still underwater, making it difficult for crews to properly assess the damage. The state government is warning of a \u201cmammoth task\u201d ahead to repair damaged roads and reconnect the state\u2019s road network. Even with the deployment of 200 extra staff and heavy machinery to support existing council crews, the government is warning repairs to roads will take \u201cmany months\u201d. The rail network is similarly affected. The Australian Rail Track Corporation said it is still conducting aerial surveys to get a proper understanding of the damage. \u201cARTC track inspections and repairs can only commence once water levels in the rail corridor recede significantly, and the duration of repairs will be dependent on the damage sustained,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to determine the cost of the repairs.\u201d    What started out as a sinkhole\u2026Today\u2019s reminder to take care when driving through flood-impacted areas.

For farmer Peter Wiggins, just outside Condobolin, the damage to the Broken Hill line and local roads undermines his ability to move goods from his properties. The damage has left some of the most productive areas of the state inaccessible to harvesting machinery \u2013 just as they prepare for harvest time in coming weeks. Farmers who are able to harvest are, in many cases, unable to move grain off their farm and are now attempting to work out how to store large volumes on their properties until roads are repaired. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause nothing but chaos,\u201d Wiggins says. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be more trucks on the road, more damage to the road.\u201d The National Farmers Federation has warned rebuilding road and rail infrastructure to reconnect farms to their customers will take \u201cmonths, years, and many billions of dollars\u201d. NFF chief executive, Tony Mahar, said the damage was \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and required repairs \u201cof a magnitude we have not seen before\u201d. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t have confidence that the government is aware of the scale of the massive crisis farmers and regional communities are facing,\u201d Mahar said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the absolute obliteration of so many arterial roads and rail lines across the country.\u201d    The problem will also be felt in the cities. The damage has compromised supply chains that cities rely on. Australia Post has warned of two-week delays to deliveries due to the damage to major rail links \u2013 including the Sydney-to-Perth corridor, which includes the damaged Broken Hill line \u2013 and the associated freight backlogs. The Australian Logistics Council says supply chain disruptions can lead to shortages of goods, commodities and equipment, and that the damage to road and rail can cause the overloading of ports and other infrastructure. The longer trips forced by damaged roads increases fuel usage, costs, and emissions, and causes accidents and blockages. \u201cThis flows on to a wide range of products and services which all push up the cost of living,\u201d a council spokesperson said. Rail freight is particularly vulnerable to severe weather, forcing rail freight to shift to the road when lines are damaged. \u201cSignificant weather events in Australia are bringing to light the lack of redundancy in the infrastructure as well as the importance of an interconnected network of modes to better handle overflows from disruptions,\u201d the spokesperson said. Damage leaves vast repair bills Since 14 September, a staggering 75 local government areas have been declared disaster zones due to flooding and heavy rain. The number grows larger still when counting the floods in August and June. Many of those councils are now grappling with enormous road repair bills. Dubbo regional council alone has warned rain and flooding has caused a $40m blowout to its road and maintenance budget, according to the Daily Liberal. The state government has boosted its contribution to the road budget, including $50m announced in October to help regional and rural councils fix potholes. It also announced earlier this month it would fast-track an additional $30m in emergency road repair funding for councils.

Earlier this month, Local Government NSW estimated successive floods and torrential rain events had caused a staggering $2.5bn in road damage. The body has declared a statewide roads emergency \u2013 something supported unanimously by NSW mayors and councillors. LGNSW president Cr Darriea Turley said the damage had caused a collapse of the local and regional road network. She said the dire situation would wreak havoc on harvest time and on Christmas travel.   Related:  Lamb chopper airlifts flock to safety as inland sea surrounds Condobolin    \u201cIn the coming weeks, close to $4bn worth of crops will need to be harvested and transported, yet harvesting machinery is unable to access some of the most productive regions in our state,\u201d Turley said. \u201cThe wider rural communities supporting Australia\u2019s food bowl are on their knees, waiting for the network to be repaired.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile, families travelling during the upcoming summer holidays will find their trips to visit family and friends severely disrupted unless councils get the support we need to rebuild the road network. Turley is calling for $1.1bn in extra funding for a program to fix local roads and country bridges and new funding to give councils plant machinery and skilled workers. \u201cNSW communities are facing an unprecedented disaster which requires an unprecedented response,\u201d Turley said.    Mahar says the problem can only be solved by a response coordinated across federal, state and local government, which is driven by the commonwealth. He says the government has indicated it recognises the need for a sustained response. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly the message we\u2019ve been given and it will be important this continues to be backed up with funding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just be lumped with decimated roads once the water recedes and the news cameras leave town.\u201d", "Morning Mail: China warns against \u2018hype\u2019, Anzac Day plea, Tucker Carlson leaves Fox [2023-04-24T20:48:03Z]": "Morning, everyone.

The 52-year-old, who is based in Redlands, Queensland, will represent the Australia pavilion in 2024, seven years after Tracey Moffatt did so in 2017. On Wednesday Moore said: \u201cThe opportunity show my work to an international audience is a big honour and privilege.\u201d Neither Moore nor the Australia Council would reveal any details of the project, which is yet to be named, but the artist said his Biennale work would \u201cbe about something I feel strongly about\u201d, including his family history and memories of where he grew up in south-east Queensland. He said his family\u2019s history was \u201csomething I\u2019ve been avoiding\u201d but that he was now \u201clooking at the family tree, going back 60,000 years\u201d. Asked if he felt any pressure representing Australia, Moore said: \u201cI won\u2019t let you down.\u201d  Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  Moore\u2019s previous works have spanned painting, sculpture and textiles, often wrestling with his memories, racism and Australia\u2019s sense of national identity. The artist has previously said \u201cmemory has been in all of my work somewhere\u201d. Since 2010 he has created four versions of his childhood home in Tara: last year, he built it inside Victoria\u2019s Gertrude Contemporary gallery, complete with the smell of Dettol \u2013 \u201cIt represents for me the fear my mother had of having her children \u2018taken away\u2019 \u2013 if we weren\u2019t looked after, clean enough,\u201d he said in an interview.    And in 2014 he worked with a master perfumer to create a series of \u201cperfume portraits\u201d that evoked moments from his childhood, including the smell of graphite pencils and paper at school, and the aroma of his aunties. In 2018 a career retrospective exhibited at the Griffith University Art Museum was installed as a series of recreated memories from Moore\u2019s childhood in rural south-east Queensland. Flags and language are common themes: his work United Neytions \u2013 28 large flags featuring designs used by Aboriginal nations on their shields, bodies and in art \u2013 hangs permanently in Sydney airport\u2019s international terminal, while his 2015 installation 14 Queensland Nations (Nations imagined by RH Mathews) saw him create flags for the Aboriginal nations mapped by Mathews, a 19th-century anthropologist.    His 2022 work Inert State involved 200 redacted coroner\u2019s reports detailing the death of an Indigenous person in custody being scattered in a pool in Queensland Art Gallery, all dating since 2008, the year the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, issued the apology to the stolen generations. For the 2013 National Artists\u2019 Self-Portrait prize he submitted a taxidermied dog painted with boot polish, titled Black Dog. \u201cSkin was an identifier of who I was and what status I held \u2013 not in the long-gone birthright of a traditional \u2018skin name\u2019, but from racist slurs that we\u2019ve all heard at some time and continue to hear today,\u201d Moore said at the time.    Queensland Art Gallery\u2019s curator of contemporary Australian art, Ellie Buttrose, will curate Moore\u2019s work at the Biennale. She described Moore as \u201csingular in his ability to engage audiences on an emotional level through memories and familial stories in artworks that stimulate discussion about how we bear the responsibility for social change\u201d. \u201cArtistically adroit and politically incisive, Archie is uniquely placed to confront Australia\u2019s past and assert Indigenous sovereignty on a worldwide scale,\u201d she added. Trevor Nickolls and Rover Thomas were the first Aboriginal artists to represent Australia in Venice, back in 1990, but did so in the same year; Judy Watson, Yvonne Koolmatrie and Emily Kngwarreye followed as a trio in 1997.   Related: John Akomfrah to represent Britain at Venice Biennale    Moffatt became the first Aboriginal artist to represent the country as a solo artist in 2017. But in 2019, artist Richard Bell made a memorable appearance at the Biennale after he applied to be part of Australia\u2019s official showing but was rejected; the Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang man organised a sculptural replica of Australia\u2019s pavilion to be driven around the canal city on a motorised barge, wrapped in chains. The Australia pavilion will be on display from 20 April until 24 November 2024, marking the nation\u2019s 25th year taking part in the Biennale.", "NSW public school cleaners assigned more than 600 tasks a day under \u2018impossible workload\u2019 [2023-03-14T14:00:33Z]": "Public school cleaners in New South Wales are given less than a minute to mop floors, clean toilets and empty bins each day, with a major union claiming the \u201cimpossible workload\u201d has led to one of the state\u2019s highest worker\u2019s compensation premiums. \nDocuments obtained by the United Workers Union detail how cleaners in state public schools are being asked to complete several hundred individual tasks each day as part of their daily work routine. \nA copy of contract specifications for one of a handful of private companies contracted to clean the state\u2019s schools show how cleaners are expected to complete 179 \u201cregular\u201d tasks as well as dozens more classed as \u201cperiodic\u201d. \nAccording to the union, those \u201cregular\u201d jobs are repeated multiple times to add up to more than 600 every day, based on the workload of an average cleaner.

She was there to assist with whatever they needed, but in the end it was she who needed the help. The 73-year-old has diabetes and constant high blood pressure was causing her to have dizzy spells throughout the driving trip. In Cobar in western New South Wales, she couldn\u2019t go on. After multiple visits to the local GP, her husband took her to the Cobar hospital for more specialised treatment. Unbeknown to her, the doctor she was about to see was nearly 14,000km away. \u201cI was having a telehealth consult, because there was no hospital doctor and no doctor that could come to the hospital,\u201d Matthews says. \u201cI asked, \u2018where are you from?\u2019 and he said: \u2018I\u2019m in Canada\u2019.\u201d   Related: \u2018Our health services were already compromised\u2019: Australia\u2019s regions struggle under Omicron\u2019s weight    Over the course of her week-long stay, Bet had three consultations with the doctor, who conducted the appointments via telehealth with the assistance of nursing staff at the hospital. \u201cHe was a nice chap, but it was really strange sitting up in your hospital bed and having the nurses wheel the TV monitor into your room, and then the doctor was there,\u201d Matthews says. The doctor Matthews saw is one of four Australian-trained medical practitioners living overseas who regularly treat rural and regional patients in the Western New South Wales local health district via telehealth, as part of a program known as the virtual rural generalist service. The virtual service is made up of a pool of 25 Australian-trained doctors, based both locally and internationally, with specialised GP experience in rural and regional communities. They provide consultations using video conferencing around the clock and have the power to assess patients and admit them to the local health facility or transfer them to a larger centre if necessary. Dr Shannon Nott, the district\u2019s rural director of medical services, says the service has been a \u201creal backbone\u201d for regional and remote communities, particularly during Covid border closures. \u201cIt was really tough for us to get workforce into some of those communities,\u201d Nott says.   Sign up for the Guardian Australia Weekend App   \u201cThe particular benefit of having doctors based overseas is the time difference, so for night shifts instead of having an Australian doctor on Australian time, tired and being woken in the middle of the night, we\u2019ve got doctors that are overseas that do the Australian night shift only.\u201d  The service started in February 2020 and builds on a telephone support service that has been operating in the health district for more than 10 years. All doctors involved have committed to doing 25% of their shifts in person in a region; so far there have been 800 days of face-to-face contact. There are 35 rural and remote communities in the district, outside Bathurst, Orange and Dubbo; so far 20 hospitals use the service regularly, after hours or when there is a gap in staffing. \u201cIn the last year, the vast majority of the contracts for our rural and remote doctors in western New South Wales have been reliant on this service supporting people after hours,\u201d Nott says. Richard Colbran, the chief executive officer of the NSW Rural Doctors Network, says specialised GPs, or rural generalists as they are known, are \u201cnot distributed well\u201d and there needs to be trialling of measures to break the distribution issues. \u201cIf you are able to build a workforce approach that chases the sun \u2013 so you\u2019ve got people who are refreshed, who are working during the day, they are appropriately skilled and trained \u2013 why in the digital era do they need to be in the local environment, or the state or even the same country?\u201d Colbran says. Currently there is a shortage of rural generalists in Australia, the NSW Rural Doctors Network saying the number has more than halved in the last 10 years. Nott recognises that people don\u2019t want to do what doctors did 30 years ago, where they worked 24/7 and felt the weight of the community. \u201cThere is no silver bullet in regard to fixing the challenges of the rural and remote medical workforce,\u201d Nott says. \u201cWe acknowledge that rural communities want local doctors, so this is very much the aim, to support a workforce and to continue to recruit and retain doctors on the frontline.\u201d", "ABC given $83.7m to reverse Coalition\u2019s funding cuts but little help for arts in 2022 budget [2022-10-25T08:46:56Z]": "The Australian Broadcasting Corporation will receive an additional $83.7m over four years to restore funding it lost as a result of the former Coalition government\u2019s freeze on annual funding increases.

The complaints come as Labor promises an immediate review of the 1,700km inland rail network. The project had \u201cgone off the rails\u201d under the Morrison-Joyce government, Catherine King, the shadow minister for infrastructure, told Guardian Australia, adding \u201cLabor will do the hard work of getting this project back on track\u201d. \u201cWe supported the Senate inquiry into inland rail and the report will guide our approach, including reviewing the business case.\u201d But Labor would not confirm whether it would support an independent review of the Narromine to Narrabri route, citing any review\u2019s need to access details only privy to government.   Related: \u2018An X on the map\u2019: inland rail flood measures fail to reassure regional NSW communities    The Coalition has refused to support recommendation 26 of the Senate inquiry, which calls for an independent comparative review of alternative routes around Narrabri. Narrabri councillors unanimously passed a motion to write to the Department of Planning and Environment withdrawing their support for the current route. The motion clarified that \u201ccouncil supports the concept of the inland rail and acknowledges the positive contributions and opportunities it will make to both the Narrabri Shire and the wider Australian community\u201d. But Rohan Boehm, a councillor, said \u201cit\u2019s the right railway in the wrong place\u201d. The council\u2019s opposition comes as other council motions have achieved varying success in having their concerns addressed.    The former Goondiwindi regional council mayor Graeme Scheu said in 2019 his council passed a motion to seek clarification regarding the inland rail\u2019s flood modelling, which resulted in the appointment of an independent hydrologist, whose feedback was incorporated to update the flood modelling for the North Star to Border section of the project. Lawrence Springborg, the current mayor and former leader of the Queensland Nationals/LNP, said the council was able to access the entire modelling, all the assumptions that underpinned it, and the data.

Ahmed Karanouh, a Coonamble councillor, said when he was mayor in 2019, the council asked how the route can be justified economically when it would bypass their town, one of the largest grain-producing areas in the country. Bill Fisher, another Coonamble councillor, said the Senate inquiry was only one expression of the council\u2019s frustration. \u201cThere was letter after letter after letter in [the] five-year council period term between 2016 and 2021.\u201d Narrabri council\u2019s motion reaffirmed that the issues, including serious flood concerns raised in the 2021 report, meant the current proposed alignment \u201cdoes not provide an optimum outcome\u201d for Narrabri. Boehm said the motion was necessary because the general manager and mayor had expressed council\u2019s support for the current alignment of the inland rail, without consulting the previous council. On 2 July 2021 a media statement from Ron Campbell, the mayor of Narrabri, said \u201cwe recognised the futility of moving the line after a number of meetings in Sydney with Inland Rail and again meetings in Canberra with the federal Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications.\u201d A spokesperson for ARTC would not confirm whether they would consider an alternate route around Narrabri, but said that the current route had already been carefully considered. \u201cThe Narromine to Narrabri section of Inland Rail has been subject to careful consideration by ARTC with studies undertaken in 2006, 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\u201d   Related: Trouble on the tracks: is Australia\u2019s $14bn inland rail project going off the rails?    \u201cThese studies demonstrated that the selected route in the Narromine to Narrabri Environmental Impact Statement (N2N EIS) provides, on balance, the best engineering solution to mitigate potential environmental, amenity, flood and other risks to the Narrabri community,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cARTC is continuing to work with the NSW Government to finalise the EIS, including addressing community feedback.\u201d Craig Davies is the mayor of the town of Narromine, whose residents have also expressed concerns surrounding potential flooding.

A Guardian Australia analysis of major party spending commitments from January to March this year shows Queensland as the biggest beneficiary of commitments from the Coalition and Labor, with the state a key battleground for parties to form government. As the official election campaign kicked off on Sunday, with an election to be held on Saturday 21 May, Guardian Australia is tracking the funding commitments of both major parties and highlighting pork-barrelling in marginal electorates.

Interactive   The party\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has promised to \u201ctrim\u201d discretionary funding programs if Labor wins office, but has not gone so far as to commit to abolishing them. Of the total $2.5bn that the opposition has committed over the past three months, at least $1.1bn is allocated to Queensland, targeting the marginal seats of Leichhardt and Flynn. The Coalition has committed a total of more than $28bn in just three months across all major government funding streams, with almost $14bn directed to projects in Queensland. This is more than the funding directed to Victoria and NSW combined. Of the total funding, $5.6bn is for projects targeting single electorates. About half of this \u2013 49% \u2013 will be directed to projects in marginal seats, accounting for $2.8bn, with 25% going to those held by Labor. While this means $2.9bn is also committed to safe or fairly safe seats with a margin above 6%, just $290m, or about 10%, of that will go towards Labor-held electorates. The total government spend from discretionary funds to safe Labor seats is just $158m \u2013 less than 3% of all funding committed, compared with more than $2bn, or 35%, spent in safe Coalition seats. Of the total $28bn committed by the Coalition since January, the largest projects include funding for large state-based road and infrastructure work, such as the north-south corridor in South Australia, the Brisbane to Sunshine Coast rail extension, the intermodal terminal package for inland rail, and more than $300m for roads in regional Tasmania where the Coalition is targeting three marginal seats. A separate Guardian Australia analysis of the government\u2019s budget infrastructure package shows that only 15% of the funded projects were recommended as priorities by Infrastructure Australia, with more than half of the $6.4bn for single electorate projects going to marginal seats. The Coalition\u2019s targeted funding includes $352m for the Milton Ulladulla bypass in the seat of Gilmore, which the Coalition is hoping it can win off Labor\u2019s Fiona Phillips.  The Labor party is also spending up in the NSW south coast seat, pledging $7.5m for a new library, $22m for a birthing centre and $25m for an emergency operations centre in Moruya.

The Coalition has committed $130m to projects in Flynn, including $45m for an alumina production facility near Gladstone, $10m for a new rural health department at James Cook University and a combined $74m for four separate road projects. In Boothby, held by the Coalition on a 1.4% margin, Labor has committed $3m for a community hall upgrade, $1.6m for a park in Blackwood, $544,000 for a tennis club redevelopment and $135,000 for a reserve in Warradale.

That is the central finding of the Liberals\u2019 2022 election review released on Thursday, blaming a combination of factors for a result it said was \u201cnot comparable\u201d to any other in Australian history and poses a \u201csignificant and unique\u201d challenge to the party. Rather than blame Morrison directly, the review by the shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, and former federal director Brian Loughnane said the Coalition allowed itself to be defined by its Labor opponents, hostile state premiers and a \u201cwell-resourced grassroots activist network\u201d supporting \u201callegedly independent candidates\u201d.   Related: Liberal party review of election loss finds 50% of candidates and new MPs should be women    At the 2022 election the Morrison government suffered a 5.7% primary vote swing, and \u201clost nearly all of its inner metropolitan seats\u201d. The party now holds just four of the 44 inner metropolitan seats, after losing six seats to teal independent candidates. Despite the Coalition actually improving on its internal polling by 3-4% during the campaign, the review found the government was weighed down by its \u201clongevity\u201d, a \u201clack of a clear forward agenda\u201d, \u201callegations of poor treatment\u201d of women and \u201cexamples of scandal, disunity and instability\u201d. \u201cThe leadership choice between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese became the most influential driver of voting intention during the campaign period,\u201d it said. Morrison\u2019s standing \u201cdeteriorated significantly through 2021 to become a significant negative\u201d and both he and the Liberal party were \u201cseen as out of touch\u201d. The review blamed \u201cperceptions that the government and the prime minister [in particular] had not adequately managed the response to the pandemic\u201d and \u201cvery importantly, that the prime minister was not attuned to the concerns of women\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The review said it was a \u201cparticular concern\u201d that the Liberal party now holds just three of the 30 seats with the highest number of female professional voters, down from 15. \u201cThe only demographic class where the Liberal party and National party have a strong hold is in rural electorates,\u201d it said. \u201cNo party that is seeking to form government has a pathway to a majority solely through rural and regional electorates.\u201d The review said the Coalition\u2019s agenda for a fourth term \u201cappeared to be limited and unclear\u201d, with the release of its signature super for housing policy just one week out from the election contributing to a view the government had \u201crun its race\u201d. The review noted the worst losses were in Western Australia, with double-digit swings seeing the party crash from 10 seats to five \u2013 the \u201cworst result\u201d since 1983. It said the decision to support Clive Palmer\u2019s challenge to the state\u2019s border closure had \u201csignificant ramifications\u201d and also noted Labor had run a targeted campaign in the state. The review noted delayed preselections had harmed the party in some states, particularly New South Wales, where \u201cpotentially attractive candidates\u201d were discouraged and the party \u201cdid not present the candidate with the strongest possibility of winning\u201d. As part of a three-person panel, Morrison hand-picked nine NSW candidates just days out from the election. The review noted that \u201cdeep frustration among party members\u201d about being locked out of preselection processes made them \u201creluctant to volunteer\u201d. The Coalition was forced to fight on multiple fronts: in teal seats where voters \u201chad a different set of election priorities\u201d, making a national election message difficult; while also losing votes to minor parties and independents who \u201cbroadly could be considered rightwing\u201d. Although the primary vote of both major parties decreased, Labor was able to benefit from a higher flow of preferences from minor parties both from its left (the Greens) and its right, with 35.7% of One Nation preferences flowing to Labor and 38.14% of United Australia votes. The review called for greater outreach to culturally and linguistically diverse communities, particularly Chinese-Australians. It noted that in the top 15 seats by Chinese ancestry, the two-party preferred swing against the Liberals was 6.6% compared with 3.7% in other seats. The review recommended:  A target of 50% female representation in parliament within 10 years or three terms, with 50% targets also for party membership and senior positions The establishment of the \u201cDame Margaret Guilfoyle Network\u201d for female staffers and MPs to promote greater female representation A timeline for preselections Deadlines for candidate selection that trigger federal intervention if state divisions fail to meet them Improved oversight of outsourced candidate vetting A code of conduct for candidates with clear penalties for breaches A Liberal party conference to engage members, particularly young and new members, to contribute to centre-right policy A national search committee to identify potential promising candidates early  The review also called on the party to redouble efforts to win back teal seats, including collecting \u201call available public information on the teal campaign, the voting record of teal MPs, their social media and other comments\u201d. In the review\u2019s single reference to \u201cclimate change\u201d, it said the teals were able to exploit perceptions of weakness on \u201cwomen, integrity and climate change\u201d.

The Greens say the flood adaptation scheme would mainly support homeowners in south-east Queensland and the NSW northern rivers who have been hit by multiple floods over recent months.

It wanted to hear \u201cwhat people are actually concerned about\u201d, she said. Even before February\u2019s floods, Watson-Brown said the climate crisis was \u201cabsolutely front of mind\u201d for voters in her leafy electorate. \u201cPeople have been devastated again this year by flooding, and that is going to happen more and more often into the future with climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is serious, it is here and it\u2019s in lots of people\u2019s back yards.\u201d The Greens say independent Parliamentary Budget Office costing of the house-raising plan assumes 48,000 homeowners would take up the grant each year for 10 years. Homeowners would be required to match the grant from their own pockets, meaning the party does not expect all would apply for the full $20,000. Watson-Brown, a practising architect, was a first-year student at the University of Queensland during the 1974 floods. \u201cOne of our first projects was to go around and look at flood damage right across Brisbane,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of my politicisation was witnessing the personal devastation that occurs with these floods.\u201d    So how much will it cost homeowners to lift their houses? Brisbane House Raising and Restumping\u2019s Luke Macdonald said it was a question he was asked \u201cabout 500 times a year\u201d. Macdonald said his phone had been running hot from people in Lismore and Murwillumbah seeking quotes, but he is only licensed to operate in Queensland. His small business raises houses and puts in the support beams and posts to hold them in place. He says an average quote is about $30,000, although prices vary widely depending on factors like house size and topography. Macdonald said he had recently quoted $50,000 to raise and restump a 90 sq metre Queenslander. \u201cBut we also absolutely quote homes for less than $20,000, if they are small houses and the engineering is simple,\u201d he said. Homeowners also require engineering reports and design plans, documents which could collectively amount to about $10,000. Once their house is lifted, most owners opt for a concrete slab underneath. They also require water and electricity to be reconnected and stairs rebuilt, all of which could cost tens of thousands of dollars more.   Related: Adam Bandt outlines seven demands for Labor in Greens\u2019 balance-of-power wishlist    Another Brisbane house raising company puts the average cost of the whole process, from planning to reconnecting services, at between $80,000 and $120,000. Still, Macdonald said policies like that announced by the Greens could be enough to \u201cinspire\u201d those who were already considering raising their homes to take the next step. \u201cIf someone gives you $20,000, that\u2019d be a pretty good incentive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if they did it.\u201d The Insurance Council of Australia said it welcomed policies that \u201cincrease community resilience to worsening extreme weather events, including investing in better protecting homes against flood\u201d.

We settled into different patterns of working, travelled a little and dared to plan for things other than just getting through the pandemic. But Australians also seemed to resume their lives with a resolve that some things should change. They voted for a new federal government and a parliament that would finally get serious about the climate crisis.

Curious exploration of different points of view is more possible if the contending parties are not shouting    It was a year of resetting what\u2019s important and recalibrating how we live and interact. To some extent, it was because of choices made during the long inward-focused pandemic years. To some extent, recalibration was imposed on us, by the rising costs of daily life. It was a year of taking stock, a year when the outrage machine seemed to quieten a bit, where a new government mostly just got on with the job of governing, and voters responded positively to the reduction in political noise. And despite challenges, including stretched household budgets and a virus that has not gone away, Australians are looking to 2023 with optimism.

The Older Persons Advocacy Network (Opan) audited 27,000 calls made by aged care residents, families and carers to aged care advocates in recent years, finding inadequate staffing was \u201ca major factor in poor-quality aged care and inadequate access to care\u201d. The report includes shocking details of abuse and neglect in aged care in the past 12 months, including, in one case, staff ignoring a wound for so long that doctors deemed it \u201crequired amputation\u201d.

The family member told staff, who said they would treat the wounds. But 10 days later the family noticed the arm appeared to be infected. It took days for staff to administer antibiotics, the report said. \u201cThe family member informed the advocate that they were increasingly concerned about the facility\u2019s quality of care,\u201d the report said. \u201cThey noted that there were different staff providing care each day, and they were concerned that the staff did not know or understand the resident\u2019s needs.\u201d Another aged care resident said they had been left \u201cshaken\u201d after being criticised for repeatedly asking their carer if they could use the toilet before their continence aid was replaced. \u201cAs a result of the incident, the resident suffered anxiety and was still required to have the same carer attend to their support,\u201d the report said. The report also detailed the impact of ongoing restrictions on resident movements and visitation due to Covid, enforced contrary to government advice. One resident was wrongly prevented from leaving their residential facility for two months because of Covid, the report said, including to attend the funeral of a close friend. Opan also detailed a series of cases in which residents alleged they were overcharged or accumulated significant unexpected debts. Roughly half the advocacy cases Opan was involved in during the past 12 months involved \u201cservice access issues\u201d, the report said. Accessing aged care services was particularly difficult in rural and regional areas, the report said. \u201cAdvocates have been involved in numerous cases where people in rural and remote locations cannot access any aged care services or have had their regular services reduced significantly,\u201d the report said.

The federal government has already announced an aged care workforce taskforce, designed to address the glaring shortages in the sector. Those shortages existed before Covid, but were exacerbated by the pandemic. Gear said the recent increase to the award wage for aged care workers was welcome, but was \u201cunfortunately\u201d coupled with insufficient funding across all levels of care. \u201cOverstretched, or under-resourced, services are a particular challenge in rural and remote locations,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some communities, providers have \u2018closed their books\u2019 because they do not have the required staff to take on new clients.\u201d Gear welcomed the government\u2019s attempts to address the workforce crisis and said he looked forward to helping devise \u201csolutions that can have an immediate impact\u201d.

A workforce support program was being used to attract and train 13,000 new aged care workers to home care, the department said.  \u201cOptions for increasing overseas supply of key workers, such as personal care workers, are also being considered, including through the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme,\u201d the department said in a statemnet.

There was nothing she could do. \u201cI sat in the gutter and watched it and cried,\u201d she said. The east coast of Australia has been battered by more than a week of torrential rain, as communities begin to survey the wreckage of fatal flash flooding that has left townships looking like war zones. South-east Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales have borne the brunt of the \u201cone in-1,000 year\u201d catastrophic weather conditions, which have claimed at least 17 lives. Residents in the regional city of Lismore in north-eastern NSW are still reeling from the worst flooding in its history, which sent huge areas of the regional city underwater with the cleanup likely to last months, if not years.      More than 700mm of rain fell in just 30 hours during the worst of the floods on Monday, forcing hundreds of the town\u2019s 43,000 residents to scramble onto their rooftops and wait to be rescued by emergency services crews. Four of the dead were in Lismore, people who were trapped in flooded homes or swept away while trying to escape. A number of the city\u2019s residents remained missing. Among the devastation have been stories of heroism and kinship. World championship surfers Mick Fanning and Joel Parkinson spent Tuesday ferrying stranded residents and distributing supplies on their jet skis at badly hit Tumbulgum on the north coast of NSW. Emergency services volunteers saved dozens of elderly trapped in their homes and facilities, using boogie boards and dinghies to pull residents through windows and ferry them to safety.      Others spent hours locating and mustering hundreds of livestock that were swept away in flood waters causing devastating losses for farmers already hit by drought and past flooding events. If lucky, the occasional cow turned up on beaches or rooftops. As the cleanup in Lismore began on Thursday, a harsh sun strengthened the stench of mud and sewage on the main street as business owners returned to their ruined shops where flood waters had crept up to the ceiling.    Mark Bailey was one of them, forced to wade through a pile of ruined goods and furniture he estimated was worth $5m amassed at the front of his collectibles store, The Penny Man. \u201cEverything in there\u2019s fucked,\u201d he told Guardian Australia, holding an album of vintage East German stamps that were dripping brown and unsalvageable. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at anyone in particular, every shop has a different story along here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be reopening here, and I would be surprised if half of the street ever does.\u201d    Many businesses that went underwater, including Bailey\u2019s, were uninsurable given their proximity to riverbanks and flood-prone areas. The cleanup had barely begun in large parts of south-east Queensland when residents were again forced to take cover due to more storms.  The \u201crain bomb\u201d that battered the capital city of Brisbane and surrounds until Monday killed 10 people and damaged more than 17,000 homes and businesses. Some 739mm of rain fell in just four days \u2013 nearly 75% of the annual average.      On Friday, all schools in south-east Queensland closed except for children of essential workers in anticipation of further \u201cextremely unstable\u201d storms.

In 2021, Australia generated 265 TWh of electricity, with a quarter of that coming from renewable sources. \nAccording to the report, building the renewable energy infrastructure, including energy storage, and creating a green hydrogen industry to serve the regions could generate between 178,000 and 372,000 jobs, with investment of between $50bn and $100bn. \nIndustry leaders among the 18 partners in ETI said a high level of collaboration and coordination would be needed to achieve the emissions cuts in the Pilbara, Hunter, Illawarra and Gladstone regions. \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nAnna Skarbek, the chief executive of Climateworks, one of the conveners of ETI, said: \u201cThis will require an unprecedented transformation of the energy system.\u201d \nEmissions in the regions accounted for 16% of Australia\u2019s total carbon footprint, with the largest being the Pilbara in Western Australia \u2013 a centre of iron ore and LNG production. \nIn the Pilbara, the report says much of the emissions come from the LNG industry. \nManaging methane leaks, recovering lost heat and electrifying the process of cooling gas down to liquid form could save about 13Mt of CO2e a year, but up to 7.6Mt would need to be captured and stored using carbon capture and storage technology \u2013 an approach which has struggled to be viable despite billions in investments. \nThe second highest emitting region, Gladstone in Queensland, could also save emissions on its LNG export industry. Large emissions cuts could also be made by electrifying processes in the aluminium industry, where other technologies were also in development to save energy. \nThis month, Rio Tinto put out a formal call for wind and solar energy projects before 2030 to power its aluminium operations in Queensland. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nIn the New South Wales Hunter region, heavy industry includes ammonia production and aluminium smelting.

Where can we find hope and connection? |  Arnagretta Hunter [2022-12-12T01:08:34Z]": "We\u2019re at the beginning of a wild few decades. A century without precedent. \u201cIncrease in extreme weather events\u201d \u2013 a prediction made by climate scientists over the past few decades, is now playing out in front of us. Drought, fire, flooding and storms are increasing in severity, with devastating consequences around the world. The language of 1.5-2C of global heating doesn\u2019t begin to describe the future. From climate science we understand that the frequency of extreme events will increase and the extremes will become more extreme. \u201cUnprecedented is not a reason to be unprepared,\u201d opined the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements. The 2020 report reflected on the disasters of 2019-2020 \u2013 devastating drought across the east coast of Australia and a summer where apocalyptic skies became normal across New South Wales and Victoria, as millions of us breathed air polluted by destruction, as our natural environment was consumed by fires that wouldn\u2019t go out.   Related: \u2018Nature is striking back\u2019: flooding around the world, from Australia to Venezuela    The wave of unprecedented events continued after Black Summer. Hailstorms in the ACT were a fierce distraction after the smoke. Many buildings and vehicles are still damaged. And then came the big new challenge of a global pandemic from a highly infectious disease, the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2. The need to protect ourselves and our loved ones showed us just how much human behaviour can change in a short time. Devastating floods in Queensland and northern NSW through last summer were an intense taste of the east coast flooding that happened, is happening, and is still predicted. Three years on from the royal commission, \u201cunprecedented\u201d hasn\u2019t finished with us. There\u2019s more heat in our global atmosphere and therefore more energy. Intense weather events are the most obvious manifestation of the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the last hundred years. So while the novelty has worn thin, \u201cunprecedented events\u201d aren\u2019t going away anytime soon. There is more to come, more we haven\u2019t faced before.

This is the century to appreciate the mix of catastrophic risks around us and the interdependence of both risk and opportunity. As we roll from challenge to crisis through to catastrophic risks, we need scientists and experts to be sharing knowledge and learning quickly. It was environmental scientists who warned of the risks ahead in 2019, as Black Summer unfolded. It was scientists and public health experts who helped combat Covid-19. Scientists and those with deep knowledge are central. We also need imagination. While science and expertise are a key element of preparing for the unprecedented, we can\u2019t prepare for the future without imagination \u2013 allowing our minds to explore events that we\u2019ve not previously confronted. The evidence base of our past offers a platform for discussion, but is incomplete without space for imagination, collaboration and sharing.   Interactive   Imagination comes through reflection and conversation \u2013 the sharing of ideas from different places. Simply recognising its power in preparing for our future is an important start. It\u2019s fostered in collaboration, creativity and new ideas.  Amid disaster, it is hard to plan and even harder to imagine the altered future ahead. Creating space for collaboration and caring within communities is a key ingredient for our future. Hope is also an important tool for resilience. Hope, joy and connection, creativity and play are synergistic with imagination. These elements help confront fear, which is essential when looking toward the challenges just over the horizon in our sometimes-dystopian future. It is imagination that allows us to not just confront challenges, but also to shape solutions and imagine a future that inspires hope. Extreme weather around our world will shape this century. Imagination, collaboration, and caring are key elements of adaptation in challenging times. There\u2019s never been a more important moment to foster community conversation. This is how we will shape our best future together. \u2022 Dr Arnagretta Hunter is a cardiologist and physician, and the human futures fellow at the Australian National University", "\u2018Jumping the gun\u2019: Coalition accused of spraying money around in $678m pledge to seal Outback Way  [2022-02-22T16:30:15Z]": "Experts have warned the federal government\u2019s pledge to seal the 2,720km Outback Way may not be the best approach for ensuring the project\u2019s success, saying the Coalition is \u201cjumping the gun\u201d ahead of the election, while remote communities have welcomed the promised development. With a federal election expected in May, the infrastructure minister, Barnaby Joyce announced $678m for tarring 1,000km of the roads connecting Laverton in southern Western Australia to Winton in Queensland, known collectively as the Outback Way. It came a day after Anthony Albanese promised a $200m roads package for the Northern Territory if it wins the election.   Related: \u2018What the hell were you thinking?\u2019: fighting flares in Narrabri over inland rail    The federal government has previously committed $330m to upgrade the route as well as a more recent $42m federal injection for upgrades along the Eyre highway, the Stuart highway from north of Coober Pedy and the Barrier highway from Burra to Cockburn. Director of the Grattan Institute\u2019s transport and cities program, Marion Terrill, says the government is \u201cjumping the gun\u201d and should not be making promises with public money when they don\u2019t understand the nature of the problem or the solution. \u201cYou don\u2019t start with a bucket of money and spray it around,\u201d she said. Terrill said her research had shown that prematurely announced projects are not only more prone to cost overrun but can also continue to be problematic. As a result, she said \u201cthe people who will benefit from this, perhaps could have benefited more from something else if careful study had been done or Infrastructure Australia had been allowed to complete its analysis\u201d. Infrastructure Australia, the body established to advise governments of infrastructure priorities to which Joyce appointed Col Murray as chair earlier last year, said it had \u201cnot received a business case for the sealing of Outback Way.\u201d The mayor of Boulia shire council along the Outback Way, Rick Britton, welcomed the announcement, which he says allowed the project to go \u201cfrom a pipe dream to now a reality\u201d. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned in a remote rural area you have to have a road corridor first and then you can build things around that. It\u2019s a bit like a chicken and an egg,\u201d he said. \u201cFor someone to come and stay in our community, they have to be able to leave in any given time or weather. A sealed road will give that connectivity.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the upgrades would support 2,197 jobs, and deliver an important economic boost across Australia\u2019s centre. Britton affirmed a road crew from his shire would be employed, and the sealed roads would bring an increase in traffic that would bolster other industries. \u201cIf you own a local hotel or roadhouse or have a business in tyre or service providers, it makes your business sustainable and you can invest in it and ramp your business up,\u201d Britton said. He said it would open up greater tourism opportunities for communities all along the Outback Way. Britton also said he believed the announcement came as an acknowledgment of the GDP that rural and remote Australia brings to the nation.

Of 100 new McDonald\u2019s Australia restaurants set to open in the next two years, about a third will be opening in regional and remote areas. Cameron Newlands, a senior director of the restaurant group, said growth in population as well as investment from government and business in regional areas was driving where they would open. \u201cAnywhere north of 5,000 [people] is something we\u2019d consider,\u201d Newlands said. \u201cBut other characteristics like traffic flow, tourism and growth potential are just as important.\u201d   Related: \u2018What the hell were you thinking?\u2019: fighting flares in Narrabri over inland rail    But the move could be controversial in towns that have battled to keep the fast-food giant out of their backyards. Tecoma, on the edge of Melbourne, fought unsuccessfully to stop a McDonald\u2019s development and Tamworth council faced controversy when it approved its fourth Mcdonald\u2019s outlet in a town that suffers high rates of obesity. Megan Belot, the president of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, said the expansion was not a positive outcome for rural patients who already have an increased risk of obesity. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to think that there\u2019s going to be more jobs and opportunities for our younger people to work in a place like McDonald\u2019s, but realistically we don\u2019t need fast food in our smaller rural communities,\u201d Belot said. She believes the focus for regional communities should be on better access to more fresh food and vegetables and meat. \u201cBecause half the time that actually can be quite a struggle, especially for remote communities.\u201d Belot said the move could create \u201cfood deserts\u201d, where fast-food restaurants are closer than access to fresh fruit and vegetables. Dr Kim Houghton, the chief economist at the Regional Australia Institute, said McDonald\u2019s may be increasingly drawn to the regions because of the growth that came during the Covid pandemic. \u201cRegions really weren\u2019t as affected by those capital city lockdowns in 2020 and bounced back much faster than the city,\u201d Houghton said. \u201cAnd couple that with a very good agricultural season on the east coast and there\u2019s a lot of optimism in our inland places. I think that would play well into the business planning for McDonald\u2019s expansion.\u201d Serrin Dewar moved last year from Melbourne to Roma, a town considered the gateway to outback Queensland, to become the licensee for McDonald\u2019s in Roma. Dewar said the need to be open to moving to a regional, rural or remote location to become a McDonald\u2019s licensee was part of her reason for applying. \u201cYou really have to want to reconnect and commit to regional,\u201d Dewar said.    Despite being a quick service brand, Dewar said she and her fiance try and incorporate the country ethos and a local flavour in their service. \u201cThat is 100% the most rewarding part of it, that all of these kids, whether they stay on with us for life or it\u2019s just a stepping stone, they\u2019ve got amazing access to training, they make friends, it looks great on their CV if they want to use it as a stepping stone before heading off to the big smoke,\u201d Dewar said. Newlands said the average McDonald\u2019s restaurant fills about 120 fulltime, part-time and casual jobs in each town so is \u201creally substantial in terms of employment opportunity across different roles from kitchen, service and management roles\u201d. Erica Spry is a Bardi Jawi traditional owner, Aboriginal research officer for the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services and research fellow with the rural clinical school of the University of Western Australia. Spry said she was very concerned about the effect of fast-food restaurants such as McDonald\u2019s on the Indigenous population, who are seeing increasing rates of diabetes across multiple generations. Research by Spry and Julia Marley, professor of health research at the rural clinical school of the University of Western Australia, shows Indigenous populations in rural and remote populations can have three times the average rate of diabetes as the general population.

Spry said before fast-food restaurants came to the Kimberley, people cooked more meals but now \u201ceveryone loves Maccas here because that\u2019s just how it is\u201d. She said even though the brand had made changes such as adding options like substituting fries with sliced apples, \u201cit\u2019s still a worry\u201d with high sugar items such as soft serve ice cream available for under $2. \u201cTheir marketing is their selling tool and people give in,\u201d Spry said. Marley said remote communities \u201cneed access to cheap fresh food \u2026 not junk food\u201d if they are to help prevent high incidences of diabetes and obesity. Marley said remote areas like the Kimberleys often experience food deserts as trucks only come in once a week or once a fortnight. And, in the dry season, tourists buy up fresh stock in supermarkets. She said picking up prepared food was often the easier option not only because it was cheaper but because of a other factors that act as drivers of obesity. \u201cIt could be that your cooker doesn\u2019t work, you don\u2019t have a working fridge or freezer, the electricity gets cut off,\u201d Marley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 10 people living in a three-bedroom house and you\u2019ve got people visiting so they can end up eating the food you\u2019ve got.\u201d", "Farmers\u2019 report warns climate crisis puts Australia\u2019s food supply at increasing risk [2022-03-08T17:00:09Z]": "Empty supermarket shelves will become a more frequent sight for Australians as the climate crisis heightens the risk of food shortages after extreme weather events, a new report says. The report, released on Wednesday by Farmers for Climate Action, entitled Fork in the road: impacts of climate change on our food supply, comes after recent food shortages across the country caused by the pandemic, bushfires, floods and inundation of rail lines. The report was prepared before the current flooding in Queensland and NSW lead to retail food shortages, but anticipated that global heating leading to a higher frequency and severity of extreme weather events would continue to put supply chains at risk. The author of the report, Stephen Bartos, an expert in food resilience and also the author of the last comprehensive review of the resilience in the Australian food supply chain, concluded that logistic chains were highly robust but would be at risk if affected by two or more catastrophic events simultaneously. Bartos said the latest report showed \u201cthere\u2019s greater fragility in the food supply chain than had previously been thought due to the impact of climate change\u201d. It found that while risks could also arise from causes other than global warming, \u201cwhat climate change does is raise the base level risk of extreme weather events \u2013 putting further pressure, like an additional weight on the scales, on the balance of risks faced in food supply every day.\u201d Bartos said Australians took for granted that food would always be available. \u201cClimate change disrupts this. It creates and amplifies risks all the way through the supply chain, from farm to warehouse to supermarket shelves,\u201d he said.   Related: Australia\u2019s supply chain issues likely to continue despite drop in Covid cases    Bartos said food shortages had a knock on effect, resulting in increased produce prices and increasing the costs of insurance and lending. CEO of Farmers for Climate Action, Fiona Davis, called on governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as the most effective way to protect against the risks facing the food supply chain. The report found increasing the diversity of supply chains, with multiple nodes and connections, would reduce some risk and that government investment in more numerous and diverse transport connections was vital. But it warned inland rail, a flagship Coalition infrastructure project, may not be a panacea. \u201cSeveral organisations consulted for this project were concerned that inland rail could be disrupted by flooding at the same time as other road and rail links,\u201d the report found. It also recommended shorter supply chains, able to respond quickly to shortages. This was demonstrated during the pandemic when local butchers and greengrocers, especially in rural towns, were able to maintain continuity of supply through their networks with producers.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        Bartos said farmers and supply chain operators are already investing in improving their risk management, but even the best systems would eventually collapse in the face of the impacts of climate collapse. \u201cAdaptation is not sustainable if climate change continues unabated. Deep cuts to emissions are therefore required to protect food supply and food supply chains,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the federal government action can do is to take what we already know is going to be a high risk and stop it from turning into an unmanageable risk.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Warning for flood-hit regions as wet weather and storms return to eastern Australia [2022-03-22T07:10:35Z]": "Rain and thunderstorms are forecast to return to eastern Australia, including over flood-hit regions of northern New South Wales and south-east Queensland, ending the longest dry spell many areas have had for a month.

Related: Scott Morrison\u2019s dereliction of duty over rapid Covid tests is a threat to Australians\u2019 public safety | Kevin Rudd    As a result of increased presentations to Tweed\u2019s emergency department, nurses were doing \u201cdouble shifts every day\u201d with one day off before resuming the toil. \u201cThey\u2019re going to fall over in a screaming heap,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will not be able to manage.\u201d Eighteen staff, many of them senior, have resigned since December out of a roster of about 150, citing burnout and the better conditions offered over the border. Queensland offers $1,800 a year for nurses\u2019 education, a Covid bonus \u2013 both absent in NSW \u2013 and higher wages, Ryan-Agnew said. \u201cThey were really top-notch, really good quality staff, and they can walk up to the Gold Coast and they\u2019ll just completely snaffle them.\u201d As Guardian Australia reported on Wednesday, nurses at Lismore Base hospital \u2013 the destination for Tweed\u2019s Covid patients needing treatment \u2013 are also struggling to cope with a surge in medical needs. The Tweed hospital is buckling under spiking demand for care and a lack of trained staff and appropriate equipment. A senior manager, for instance, had to phone around themselves and then purchase the triage tent prior to Christmas after months of pleading to the health department, Ryan-Agnew said. The tent, though, remains far from adequate, with no toilet, forcing potentially Covid-positive patients \u2013 and anyone waiting for PCR testing to cross the border \u2013 to traipse through the main hospital lobby. \u201cYou can have people with heart conditions, sick kids, elderly, frail, all sitting there waiting to be seen, and you\u2019ve got a potential Covid patient walking through the waiting room,\u201d Ryan-Agnew said. Patients with chest and severe abdominal pain, septic children and adults should be in beds not a tent without nursing care, staff said. Earlier this week, one Covid patient had to wait 17 hours before being transferred to Lismore, while another patient had to wait 30 hours before being moved on Wednesday. The nurse manager shares office space and air-conditioning with two beds set aside for Covid patients with no air-locked space for changing PPE. \u201cWe have bottles of hand sanitiser sitting on top of overflowing bins, flapping Covid tent flaps compromising PPE,\u201d another staff member, who requested anonymity, said. \u201cWe also continue to struggle getting adequate PPE and supplies, certain masks run out, no hair coverings and no disposable blood pressure cuffs.\u201d    A Northern NSW Local Health District spokesperson said a \u201ctransportable treatment area\u201d had been set up to treat Covid-positive patients without serious illness so they didn\u2019t need to enter the hospital. \u201cAs with any month in a large organisation there has been some staff turnover, however, this is not different [from] other months or years,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThese positions have been filled with new staff, casual staff, and any potential shortages can also be filled with staff between wards and facilities. \u201cOur workforce across northern NSW has been increased and upskilled, with more than 265 staff attending surge training in intensive care, emergency care and immunisation specialties to provide additional capacity if needed.   Related: The foundations of our healthcare system have been washed away | NSW emergency nurse    \u201cWe regularly review our stocks and supply chains of resources, including PPE and pharmacy items, to ensure adequate supplies.\u201d According to Ryan-Agnew, some of Tweed\u2019s problems were partly self-inflicted. Pathology North, the department\u2019s regional pathology unit, offered to supply Tweed with a BD MAX machine used to conduct Covid tests on the spot. That would save sending the results three times a day for what can be a six-hour journey. \u201cWe just needed the scientists to use it because you have to have doctors to be able to read the results,\u201d Ryan-Agnew said, but the hospital management refused to set aside space to house it. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have the BD MAX.

But they need an \u201chonest discussion\u201d from governments to support their communities on the path to net-zero.  The report, What Regions Need, is the result of a year\u2019s qualitative research consulting local workers, civic leaders, unions, the energy sector and others by the chief executive of the not-for-profit organisation The Next Economy, Dr Amanda Cahill. It argues for a national plan for net zero with detailed targets and policy settings, and the formation of national and regional transition authorities to help strengthen and diversify regional economies.   Related: Barnaby Joyce refuses to use term energy \u2018transition\u2019 because it \u2018equals unemployment\u2019     Cahill describes a significant shift in public sentiment in places like regional Queensland and the New South Wales Hunter valley, as well as a renewed willingness from industry, energy companies and environmental groups to engage after the bruising experiences of the last federal election campaign. \u201cWhen we started our consultations two years ago, most [regional] people were questioning the whole concept of the energy transition,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cNow people see that things are changing quickly, with early closure announcements for coal plants, our trading partners increasing their climate ambitions and the rapid expansion of renewable energy projects across the country. They want to see a clear plan and support so they can manage these changes.\u201d Cahill, a Churchill scholar whose work focuses on helping regional economies affected by transition in the energy sector, said an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of participants in the group\u2019s engagement activities now acknowledge the inevitability of decarbonisation.

Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning.   \u201cThe hesitancy across all groups stemmed from violent scenes that occurred in central Queensland in the lead-up to the 2019 federal election, when supporters of the Adani Carmichael coalmine led by a group of conservative politicians clashed with environmental protesters. \u201cTwo years later, industry and energy players did not want \u2018to be seen to be getting political\u2019, government employees were concerned about \u2018keeping their jobs\u2019, and union and environmental groups did not want to be responsible for \u2018a repeat of what happened in 2019\u2019,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe risks taken by some participants to attend, let alone participate in this conversation in central Queensland cannot be overstated and pre-summit meetings with potential participants were dominated by fear and scepticism.\u201d At the summit, the Queensland government-owned Stanwell Corporation, the state\u2019s largest power generator, announced plans to transition to renewables and curtail coal plants. The chief executive of Stanwell, Richard van Breda, resigned a few days later. In the longer term, the report says the summit gave industries and local governments confidence to act. And conversations in communities have now changed. The Queensland government, on the eve of an election, is promoting Gladstone as a potential \u201crenewable energy powerhouse\u201d. Kahn Goodluck, a boilermaker and the acting mayor of Gladstone, said the community with a \u201cproud industrial heritage\u201d needed to plan and adapt for coming changes. \u201cWe have some of the biggest industry players in the world but we can\u2019t leave it to industry and business alone, we need government policies and investment that support success,\u201d Goodluck said. \u201cFailure is not an option. Our workers and their families\u2019 livelihoods depend on it.\u201d While sentiment about the inevitability of transition has shifted, workers remain concerned that new industries will develop in a way that affects their working conditions. Participants at workshops cited the LNG boom during the last decade, where the rapid expansion of the industry created jobs but also created cost of living concerns, and, ultimately, left many locals in the lurch when construction ramped down and property prices collapsed.

Regional harms According to the latest report from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission\u2019s (ACIC) Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program released this week, people living in regional areas are more likely to experience the harms related to substance use. Using wastewater data collected by the Universities of Queensland and South Australia across 58 sites nationally \u2013 covering over half the population \u2013 the report seeks to understand local drug markets across all capitals and a range of regional cities and towns up to August 2021. It draws on five years of data collected since the program began, and found consumption of most drugs has generally been higher per capita in regional Australia. The exception is in cocaine and heroin use, where consumption is higher in the cities, and the report notes these two drugs are exclusively imported, without any domestic production. Drugs of concern Mark Powell, operations manager of Western Region Alcohol &amp; Drug Centre in Victoria, says availability is often the most important determinant of what drugs people use. He says people in regional areas are able to make and produce methamphetamine because it can be produced in backyard labs, which is also dangerous to health.  The report found the consumption of nicotine and alcohol far exceeded that of all other substances monitored nationally in the reporting period of August to October 2021. Of the illicit drugs, meth was the most consumed over the five-year study (8,838kg), followed by cocaine (4,711kg), MDMA (1,231kg) and heroin (984kg).    Regional consumption of methamphetamine, along with alcohol, nicotine, MDMA, oxycodone, fentanyl and cannabis, exceeded capital city consumption per capita. Michelle Campbell, the clinical services manager for Lives Lived Well in regional NSW, says alcohol use accounts for 35% of services offered, meth 30% and cannabis 15%. Powell identifies the same drugs as \u201cthe top three drugs of concern\u201d at his service in Western Victoria.   Related: Support for legalising marijuana in Australia nearly doubles over six years    Shane Neilson, principal adviser for drugs at ACIC, says the data shows there was a record high regional consumption of methamphetamine in April 2020, soon after national Covid restrictions were introduced, but that up to August 2021 there had been a tangible decrease. Neilson says the purpose of the data was to enable ACIC to engage more closely with the relevant response agencies, such as law enforcement and health. However, he says there is often less access to drug-related services in regional areas. Reduced treatment options Professor Jacqueline Bowden, the director of the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction, says there are reduced treatment options in regional areas as most of the alcohol and other drug workforce is based in metropolitan areas. Powell agrees, saying people in regional areas must travel further for treatment without access to public transport, and this in itself becomes a factor contributing to higher use. \u201cIf people have easy access to help, they\u2019re more likely to access help,\u201d he says. Powell also says the lack of access to mental health services and huge waitlists for those services available adds to the problem. \u201cA lot of people who present with substance use issues have significant histories of trauma and mental health issues,\u201d he says. According to Powell, both those needs should be addressed but \u201cto get psychological help is really hard so that compounds and can add to the reasons why people might need to use substances just to cope, just to survive.\u201d At Western Region Alcohol &amp; Drug Centre, Powell says people come to the service who have suffered child abuse growing up, so too victims of family violence, victims of sexual assault, as well as veterans and people who have worked in emergency services suffering trauma. Bowden says \u201call of this data is compounded by the very regional and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities where we have massive issues of social exclusion, marginalisation, discrimination, cumulative trauma that then increases alcohol and other drug use behaviours.\u201d    Solutions In recovery from her addiction, Simmons went on to start Australian Anti-Ice Campaign, and believes education is key. The campaign travels around the country to raise awareness, especially working in remote areas of Australia which don\u2019t have a lot of drug services. However, when it comes to those already taking drugs, Bowden says there are still many barriers, including the harms that come from criminalisation.  Bowden says many fear getting help will adversely affect them and their family. \u201cPeople often won\u2019t come to treatment because they\u2019re worried about owning up to dependence, they think they may lose their kids as a result,\u201d she says. Bowden says reducing the stigma and treating the problem as a health issue is essential. According to Powell, the stigma is especially strong in small communities where everybody knows one another, as there\u2019s a greater fear of judgement. \u201cWhat concerns me the most is I think people fear coming to get help early enough,\u201d he says. Bowden says recruitment issues need to be addressed as people working in drug treatment mostly have short-term contracts, which makes it harder to attract and maintain the workforce, especially in rural and regional areas. She says other solutions exist, including up-skilling generalists who are already in regional and rural areas, as well as more use of telehealth. Bowden says more resources also need to be extended to help families as \u201cit doesn\u2019t just affect individuals, it affects everyone around the individual.\u201d Campbell agrees that in smaller towns an overdose can affect the whole community. \u201cSometimes whole communities will shut down. There\u2019s a lot of connection,\u201d she says.", "From Lake Menindee to the English Channel: outback grazier completes marathon journey [2022-08-04T17:30:22Z]": "The far western New South Wales grazier Brendan Cullen lives a long way from a swimming pool. His Kars station is 60km south-east of Broken Hill. In 2016, he decided to swim to help with his depression. Cullen began making use of any body of water. He used dams on his property and tethered himself to a wall in a plunge pool or drove the 60km to the Broken Hill YMCA. The Menindee Lakes can go for years with barely a puddle during dry times, the same droughts that had put so much mental strain on Cullen in the first place. Luckily recent rainfall had filled the lakes so that provided a decent 15km swim, though once he had to pull up when a fish swam into his mouth.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter      Sign up for the Rural Network newsletter   Then three years ago, he set himself the goal of swimming the English Channel, a distance of some 30-40km. \u201cI did a marathon of work leading up to the swim [but] at no point did I ever do a 35 or 40km swim,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I put a lot of kilometres into my training, especially in the last couple of months, I was doing 30-40km a week.\u201d    Last weekend, the 49-year-old crossed the open waters of the Channel, battling tough conditions including 4.5 knot tides, jellyfish and fatigue to complete the swim from England to France in 17 hours. \u201cWhen I jumped in at Dover, I was thinking this is pretty rough, I hope this dies off. It did a little bit, but not much. I could see the boat getting knocked around and I was thinking this is going to be a hell of a journey,\u201d he says. Then at the 13\u2013 to 14-hour mark, in a spot known as the \u201cChannel swimmers\u2019 graveyard\u201d, he hit a strong tide which took him away from France. \u201cYou can see it on the map and Mike Gregory, my coach, said this is when your training comes in, this is when you have to start digging deep.\u201d By this point, the sun had gone down. Cullen was losing sight of France, which actually helped because it was no use looking up. He had been taking Panadol and ibuprofen every four hours and knew he had been in the water for 15-plus hours. \u201cI tell you what, the last couple of kilometres were pretty hard, even though the water was much calmer as you come inside the bay,\u201d Cullen says. \u201cPhysically knowing that I only had that far to go, it sort of made me relax a bit and then I thought I don\u2019t know if I have got it in me to get there.\u201d But then he dug deep, having come so far. Cullen says he was never going to give up \u2013 \u201cno way in hell\u201d. When he finally got it done, the relief was palpable. Not just for his own enormous effort but the support of his wife, Jacinta, eldest daughter, Emma, and sister-in-law, Julie.    \u201cIt\u2019s those moments, when you catch up with your loved ones. They\u2019re so special. When I hit the shores of France, I opened my cage and I reckon I blurted my eyes out for about two minutes and dropped to my knees and just thought my god, we are here,\u201d Cullen says. His family wrapped him up and took care of him. He lay on a beanbag with no idea of time, as physically exhausted as he has ever been in his life. Now, he is taking time to slow down, swimming for the joy of it and spending more time with his family. Cullen is also a Lifeline ambassador. Scott Hammond, the chief executive officer of Lifeline Broken Hill Country to Coast, says Cullen\u2019s journey resonates with so many as it inspires and encourages people to take the first and crucial step to seek help and support. \u201cSomething that Brendan does so well is his mental preparation \u2013 that just shines through, not only his swimming but what he does to support our communities as an ambassador for Lifeline,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mirror of who he is whether he\u2019s in the water or out of the water.\u201d  Otis Filley is a freelance journalist and film-maker based in Broken Hill.

A report by the Queensland Audit Office found that the quick ramp-up of staff required to administer the Covid support program had resulted in cases where close relatives of public servants were hired, and where conflicts of interests were not declared among members of hiring panels. \u201cThis increases the risk of inappropriate contracts being entered into and value for money not being obtained,\u201d the report, tabled in parliament this week, found. Grants were approved by staff for amounts above what they were allowed to approve, and one contract was approved in a way that did not align with government policies.   Related: Queensland advances green hydrogen and ammonia project to be powered by renewables    The audit found that about 8% of the loans paid out from the scheme \u2013 a total of about $96m \u2013 were not likely to be repaid. About 5% of loans were approved to businesses that were rated as high to severe risk. Other issues raised included that approvals were processed manually, supplier information was not restricted and that payment files were not encrypted. In order to assess, process and pay the increased volume of loans and grants related to government Covid support schemes, the responsible agency, the Queensland Rural and Industry Development Authority, almost doubled its full-time staff. Temporary employees were recruited, taking full-time staff numbers from 118 to 201. \u201cWhile [the authority] provided training to employees during this period of rapid expansion, it did not adhere to some policies and procedures,\u201d the audit report said. \u201cIn addition, the systems and processes [internal controls] it had in place, which were appropriate for a smaller entity, were not adapted as the size, complexity, and risk of the entity increased. \u201cAs the government wants to respond quickly to the challenges faced by the community and support businesses in the pandemic, administrators and program owners must ensure that controls can adapt to changes in the nature and volume of services they deliver.\u201d Other issues raised by the auditor general in his annual report on state entities included concerns that government information systems contain weaknesses and need to be better protected from hackers. The report also found that government systems were in some cases susceptible to fraudsters, who would email departments requesting changes to bank account details for suppliers.

This significantly increases the risk of fraud.\u201d The report said that of 10 deficiencies identified related to the rollout of the Covid loan program, eight had already been addressed. The Queensland agricultural industry development minister, Mark Furner, said the department was continuing to work to address the remaining deficiencies. \u201c[The] report provides important lessons on striving for greater transparency within government and protecting public value during times of organisational change,\u201d Furner said.", "\u2018It\u2019s hard coming home to a tent\u2019: the rise of Australia\u2019s working homeless [2022-12-16T14:00:56Z]": "At 5am most mornings, Cheryl Rowe\u2019s alarm wakes her up in the camping trailer where she has been living for three months. It signals time for the 63-year-old to start her work day as a cleaner. Torch in hand, she gets ready and packs the car at the caravan park in Western Australia\u2019s Margaret River region. She has been asked to be quiet so as not to wake the tourists. Then she spends the rest of her day cleaning, part of it scrubbing holiday homes that sometimes sit empty. \u201cIt\u2019s hard every night after work coming home to a tent rather than a home,\u201d says Rowe, who has been living at the campsite since her rental of five years was sold. \u201cYou\u2019re living out of your car. You\u2019re living out of supermarket bags. \u201cI work full-time. I should be able to get a home.\u201d    Over the past two years, Australia has slipped into a new frontier of homelessness: people who are working yet still can\u2019t find an affordable home. Many are facing Christmas in tents, motels and caravan parks. As chief executive officer of Mission Australia, Sharon Callister says: \u201cWhen gainful employment is no longer enough for many Australians to guarantee a roof over their head, then you cannot deny the housing and rental market is in absolute crisis.\u201d \u2018Now it\u2019s common\u2019 Across the country, people closest to the crisis say it is getting worse. \u201cSuddenly I realised all these people that were staying here were going off to work everyday and going to school and I\u2019m thinking \u2018but why are they here in tents and caravans?\u2019\u201d says Scott Gadd, who manages the Hobart Showgrounds where a number of people struggling to find a home are living. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing problem and it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\u201d In the Bega Valley Shire on the south coast of NSW, the manager of the area\u2019s programs for Mission Australia, Donna Davis, says two to three years ago the service rarely had people asking for help who were working yet homeless.

More than a quarter of people seeking support from homelessness services are without a home for this reason. (The most frequent cause remains family and domestic violence.)    We\u2019ve tried to say to explain [to the kids] that we\u2019re just going on a little holiday   Krystal Young     Australians in regional areas are struggling most. The number of Australians experiencing homelessness has grown by 13% over the past four years, the monitor found. In regional Western Australia, where Rowe lives, the number has risen by 35%, the highest rate in the country.  Callister says a major issue has been people from the city flocking to regional and rural areas and pricing locals out. At the same time, vacancy levels have plummeted and natural disasters have wreaked havoc on available housing stock. In the past year alone, rents have increased by 13.2% nationally, and in some regions by almost 25%. Meanwhile, Australians\u2019 wages have not kept pace. In May 2021, the average weekly income in Australia was $1,783.70. A year later it was $32.40 more. ABS data from September 2022 shows an annual wage increase of just 3%. As Rowe has found, being homeless isn\u2019t cheap. She is paying $350 a week for a powered caravan park site and $270 a month to store her furniture. \u201cIt\u2019s hard seeing that money go into staying at a caravan park instead of a home,\u201d she says.    But the hardest part of the whole ordeal, she says, was checking her terminally ill husband into hospital after she realised she couldn\u2019t care for him in a home, and a caravan park was her only option. When he died two months ago, she kept the flowers from the funeral in the boot of her car and tent. \u201cThat was difficult, very difficult,\u201d she says. \u2018The kids have been getting sick\u2019 The homelessness services tasked to help Australians facing homelessness often find they cannot help those in need because there are few long-term housing options. From 2020 to 2021, more than 109,000 Australians came to a homeless charity needing long-term housing, according to a report by Homelessness Australia. A home was found for 3,713 people; 105,000 missed out. For almost four months, Krystal Young has been living in a motel in Dubbo, with her partner and their four young boys, all aged under seven, in one room.

On Friday, the council of education ministers decided to extend the deal until December 2024, meaning governments will not have to increase public school funding beyond existing commitments until 2025. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, defended the delay as necessary to conduct a review to ensure funding is directed to the neediest students, but the Australian Education Union (AEU) has warned \u201cresources delayed are resources denied\u201d. Public schools receive 20% of the schooling resourcing standard (SRS) from the federal government and up to 75% from the states, but due to a loophole for capital depreciation, are set to remain at 91% of full funding for the rest of the decade. Before the 2022 election Labor committed only to develop a \u201cpathway\u201d to full funding, sparking concern from the AEU that the timeline for improvement was vague.

Now we know why.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Cobbold said public schools on average receive just 87.1% of the schooling resource standard, and the current timeline was costing them $6bn a year in funding. The AEU\u2019s president, Correna Haythorpe, said the one-year extension \u201cdelays and therefore denies students in public schools the funding they need\u201d. \u201cThere has now been a generation of children who have been denied full and fair funding for their entire school lives. This can no longer continue.\u201d Haythorpe said the review should confirm governments must \u201censure public schools are funded to a minimum of 100% of the [standard] from 2024\u201d. \u201cThe Australian Education Union, as the voice of public school principals, teachers and education support staff, will accept nothing less.\u201d The Greens have announced they will protest the move by seeking to scrap the 20% cap on federal contributions to government schools, which was legislated by the Turnbull government in the Gonski 2.0 funding package. Greens schools spokesperson, senator Penny Allman-Payne, said the delay was \u201coutrageous\u201d and would see \u201cpublic school kids wait another year for a fair go while continuing to pour public money into elite private schools\u201d. \u201cThis decision will also heap further strain on under-resourced teachers and schools, and will worsen crippling teacher shortages.\u201d Clare said the federal government is still \u201ccommitted to working with state and territory governments to get every school to 100% of its fair funding level\u201d, noting that the review, to be launched next year, \u201cwill focus on driving real and measurable improvements for students from disadvantaged backgrounds\u201d. These included \u201cregional, rural and remote Australia, First Nations students, students with disability, and students from low socio-economic backgrounds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will also improve transparency and accuracy of funding. Future funding will be tied to reform.\u201d Allman-Payne said a review by a panel of eminent Australians was unnecessary because the Gonski report \u201cdid the work already\u201d in identifying the need for more needs-based funding. \u201cThis government will have a fight on its hands in 2023 \u2026 The Greens will use every lever at our disposal, inside and outside parliament, to push Labor to deliver the funding teachers have been pleading for for a decade.\u201d Before the 2019 election, Labor promised $14bn over 10 years for public education, but the policy was dropped after it was identified in Labor\u2019s election review as one of the expensive items that required the opposition to propose more revenue raising measures. The extension of the funding agreement has no impact on non-government schools, which are on a pathway to 100% of the standard by 2029.", "Narrabri businesses join groundswell against proposed inland rail route [2022-03-14T16:30:28Z]": "Opposition to the proposed inland rail has ramped up in north-west New South Wales with the Narrabri Chamber of Commerce joining the local National party branch to call for an investigation into an alternative route. The growing opposition comes as Barnaby Joyce is due in Narrabri to address fears that the project could cause flooding in the area. The Narrabri Chamber of Commerce withdrew support for the government\u2019s preferred route late last week in favour of investigating an alternative, following the lead of the local National party branch last month. After the Narrabri branch defied party policy, the deputy prime minister told the ABC the economic development generated for regional communities justified the need to \u201cmake sure it happens as quickly as possible\u201d. The Narrabri Chamber of Commerce voted last week for an independent assessment of the route over the speed of its delivery. The chamber also voted unanimously to get an independent assessment of the inland rail alternative route and swung its support behind the Narrabri Inland Rail Route concerned residents group which is lobbying for the alternative route. Narrabri is one of a number of towns up and down the line who feel community consultation on the project has been inadequate.    Jim Purcell, a long-term local irrigation and hydrology expert who addressed the local National party branch before their vote, also addressed the chamber of commerce , raising serious concerns about the potential for flood risk. Purcell is part of the council\u2019s floodplain committee, whose report led to the council\u2019s opposition to the proposed inland rail route before Narrabri\u2019s mayor and general manger overturned that opposition in July 2021. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismiss a group that has Narrabri Shire Council itself, Narrabri Shire Floodplain Risk Management Committee, the local Nationals party branch and the Chamber of Commerce all on side,\u201d Purcell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going away, they\u2019ve worked that out now.

Councillor John Clements said the inland rail required consent from the NSW government. The NSW government has yet to provide planning approval for the Narromine to Narrabri section of the project, despite the ARTC having already hired contractors and bought properties for the project, Purcell says. \u201cThat shows an organisation in panic mode or bully mode.

Her regional hospital was not dealing with Covid cases but was struggling because the bigger hospitals in Perth were backlogged.

The study, led by researchers at the University of Queensland, used satellite data to examine the extent to which human activities have encroached on coastlines around the globe. It found that up to 2013 \u2013 the latest year for which the data was available \u2013 few intact coastlines remained, with even remote areas such as the Kimberley region of Western Australia affected by fishing and mining. The research, published in the scientific journal Conservation Biology, builds on previous work that examined human activities within terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The small areas of coast that remain undamaged by pressures such as fishing, agriculture, urban development, mining and roads were mostly in Canada, followed by Russia, Greenland, Chile, Australia and the United States.   Related: \u2018We are custodians\u2019: the fights to save Australia\u2019s eroding beaches    Very few intact areas and often high levels of degradation were found in island nations, much of Europe, and countries including Vietnam, India and Singapore. Coastal regions containing seagrasses, savannah and coral reefs had the highest levels of human pressure. Brooke Williams, the study\u2019s lead author and a conservation ecologist at the University of Queensland, said because most of the world\u2019s population live in coastal regions, the pressures on those ecosystems could take many forms and occurred both on land and at sea. \u201cOur paper really advocates for coastal region restoration quite urgently,\u201d she said. \u201cThat such a low proportion is at the higher spectrum of the intactness scale is alarming. It\u2019s not good news.\u201d The situation certainly would not have improved since 2013, she said.    The coastal analysis was compiled by using two datasets called the human footprint (which examined land-based ecosystems) and the cumulative human pressure index (which examined pressures in marine environments). Pressures were then mapped out to 50km on either side of the shoreline. Williams said areas that were still largely intact were often more remote and thus more difficult to access. In Australia, the Great Australian Bight remained relatively untouched, but Williams noted it had faced development threats in recent years. Co-author James Watson, of the University of Queensland, said remoteness didn\u2019t guarantee coastlines would remain intact, pointing to mining and particularly fishing as industries causing environmental decline in those places. He said he had expected Madagascar, Namibia and northern Australia would all retain large areas of intact coastline, but it had not proved to be consistently the case. \u201cIt shocks me how pervasive fishing is. It\u2019s just everywhere. You can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d he said.

Both Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison have mostly failed to discuss poverty in the public forum, although a few Labor MPs have broken party lines to say they support an immediate increase to jobseeker. The Greens and a lot of smaller parties and independents have an increase in welfare payments as their policy. I believe the lack of having these conversations just shows how out of touch Australian politicians actually are. Both sides are talking about the cost of living but leave out the impacts this is having on people living below the poverty line who are impacted the most. Living on $330 a week is unsustainable and I can\u2019t help but wonder how long it\u2019s been since a politician had to choose between a loaf of bread or two litres of milk. If they have to walk around a supermarket with a calculator stopping to type in each product, afraid to go over a limit, and have to put things back at the checkout? Have they ever had to sleep in a tent instead of a house and not by choice? This is what Australians are facing and letting people access their super early isn\u2019t going to fix it. Whoever wins the next election has a big job ahead of them. I hope they also understand that governing the country is a privilege and not a right. They need to govern for all, not just the wealthy. After all, the poor vote too. Ignoring us won\u2019t make the problem of poverty go away. It will just make us louder. Poverty is and always has been a policy choice. Now we need a government to make the right choice. \u2022 Melissa Fisher is an Adelaide artist and anti-poverty activist who relies on jobseeker \u2018The attention regional Australia receives is tokenistic at best\u2019 Election promises during an ever-evolving campaign have been diverse and plentiful but whether meaningful change is on the way for north Queensland remains to be seen. While the seat of Herbert is being hotly contested and inspiring some good old-fashioned pork-barreling, and the Coalition certainly capitalised on discretionary grants in their pre-election budget, it\u2019s difficult to determine which policies and commitments will amount to long-term sustainable growth for our region. Both major parties have committed $70m to the NQH2 Hydrogen Consortium and promised support to the Townsville City Deal. The Coalition supports Hells Gate dam and development of an industrial precinct in Ayr, while the opposition is promising manufacturing opportunities and backing the NQ SPARK defence simulation facility. A variety of policies to address the regional housing crisis have been announced and debated, from building tens of thousands of homes and lowering deposits for home buyers through to capping mortgage rates and the concept of government co-ownership. I fear that stimulating demand without properly addressing supply may inadvertently result in price hikes and the cynic in me questions the \u201cbenefits\u201d of quick-fix solutions to such a complex issue.

I try not to roll my eyes each time I hear that regional Australia is the \u201clifeblood of our nation\u201d when the attention we receive is often tokenistic at best.

Covid was only muttered in the same breath as economic recovery, as our PM claimed credit for saving the country despite surging cases and record deaths. The health system is still under enormous strain and staff are fatigued from doing the actual saving, but Scott Morrison was too loudly singing his own praises to notice. He created distractions and behaved like Covid was a distant memory, basking in its afterglow while arguing workers getting slammed to drive his miraculous economic recovery didn\u2019t deserve a pay rise.  There\u2019s been no acknowledgement that all it took was a virus to expose the frightful inadequacies in our chronically underfunded healthcare system. No vision to create the brighter country that anxious Aussies dreamed we could become during the dark days of lockdowns. Only the Greens have made any attempt to better the healthcare system by announcing dental and mental into Medicare. I found the PM mocking Anthony Albanese for his slow Covid recovery distasteful when I know paramedics who have long Covid \u2013 my workmates couldn\u2019t wait it out in the Lodge and they certainly couldn\u2019t brag about their workload while lying face down in a coma.

Sitting National party MP Barnaby Joyce was accused of politicising the Wytaliba deaths at the time (Joyce subsequently said his comments had been misrepresented). \u201cI\u2019m at an age now when I just deal with that sort of stuff by not making any comment, because he has since apologised for that,\u201d Sparks says. \u201cBut to me that shows his attitude, and it\u2019s blatant, it\u2019s out there and everybody sees it.\u201d Sparks also wants to tackle the abuse women face in politics. She cites the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins inside Parliament House as an example of the type of political culture she\u2019d like to change for the sake of young constituents. \u201cWhat she had to put up with afterwards has just disgusted a lot of women, and in rural areas it\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know about these things. \u201cWe\u2019ve been absolutely disgusted at \u2026 some men\u2019s behaviour, and I really want them to know that I support women, I support gay people, I support Aboriginal people, and children.

Triggered after reporting by Guardian Australia, the inquiry found multiple problems with the scheme, including \u201cserious flaws in its design and operation that raise fundamental questions about whether it can achieve the stated goal of \u2018no net loss\u2019 of biodiversity\u201d. In theory, offsets should compensate for the destruction of habitat caused by development by protecting and improving equivalent habitat elsewhere.   Related: Flaws in Australia\u2019s carbon credits schemes undermine transparency, new report finds    But a series of stories by Guardian Australia revealed serious problems, including offsets that were promised but never delivered, so-called double-dipping on already protected land and conflict of interest concerns. In a report tabled Thursday, the NSW Greens-led inquiry found that rather than being a last resort, the scheme made it too easy for developers to make a cash payment to a fund administered by the state\u2019s Biodiversity Conservation Trust with \u201cno guarantee that like-for-like offsets will ever be found\u201d. It found the state\u2019s biodiversity market, which allows the trade of species and ecosystem credits, \u201cdoes not appear to be working for anyone\u201d, with developers facing uncertainty over the cost of offsets and whether the necessary credits would be available, and landowners not finding enough incentive to enter the scheme. \u201cThese issues with the scheme\u2019s operation, coupled with a lack of transparency, have led to a perception of many stakeholders that the scheme is profiting a few while failing to deliver meaningful protection for biodiversity,\u201d the report said. The committee\u2019s chair, Greens MLC Sue Higginson, said reform of the scheme was \u201cessential if we are to turn back the tide of destruction and prevent extinction of even more native species\u201d. Labor\u2019s environment spokesperson, Penny Sharpe, said NSW had a biodiversity crisis and the tool the government was relying on was \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d. \u201cThis inquiry has shone a light on how the scheme is failing and provides a cross-party consensus on what needs to be done to fix it. \u201cI urge the NSW government to take its recommendations seriously.

She said the scheme\u2019s design should be overhauled. The committee made 19 recommendations, which include establishing clear thresholds for when offsets should not be permitted for ecosystems and species that were so threatened that damage to their habitat was impossible to offset. It called for a review of some of the methods used to calculate environmental gains at offsets sites, and said counting rehabilitation of mining sites towards offsets for mining companies should be banned entirely. It suggested more stringent criteria be established for developer payments to the BCT\u2019s fund as well as continued review of the management of conflicts of interest within the biodiversity market. While the committee said it had no evidence of actual wrongdoing by environmentalconsultants who Guardian Australia previously reported made windfall gains fromthe scheme, it found that the case did illustrate that when there is insufficienttransparency in the scheme, including how potential conflicts of interest aremanaged, it is \u201copen to the perception of collusion or insider trading betweenconsultants, their clients and/or the authorities managing it\u201d. The committee said there were multiple areas of the scheme in which conflicts ofinterest could arise and recommended the planning and environment departmentcontinue to review arrangements for managing conflicts of interest, in addition toimprovements already made over the past year.   Related: Australia risks being a \u2018state sponsoring greenwashing\u2019 if it relies on carbon offsets, expert warns    The committee acknowledged the government had done some work in the past 18 months to make improvements to the offset scheme. The NSW environment minister, James Griffin, said he welcomed the report and would respond in due course. The government\u2019s response is due on 24 February 2023. \u201cSince taking on the responsibility for this scheme in December last year, I\u2019ve tasked my department with making improvements to ensure it meets expectations, with a focus on improving integrity, transparency and supporting participation in the scheme,\u201d he said. Government members of the committee wrote a dissenting report saying the work to improve the scheme, as well as several other recent inquiries, had not been fully acknowledged in the findings. That work included a new assurance program for the scheme with an independent monitor, including ecological monitoring requirements in all offset site agreements, and starting work on a record system for offset obligations. They said the report also minimised evidence from officials, failed to give a balanced presentation of stakeholder evidence and contained \u201cfactual errors\u201d, particularly in relation to the role of the BCT. Guardian Australia\u2019s reporting triggered several internal reviews by the government. The state\u2019s auditor general also brought forward a review of the scheme. In a report delivered in August, the auditor found the scheme was failing to protect some of the state\u2019s most endangered species and ecosystems and is riddled with integrity and transparency concerns. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2022 to make clear that the report of the parliamentary inquiry into the integrity of the NSW biodiversity offsets scheme said it had no evidence of actual wrongdoing by environmental consultants.", "Smoke in the air as Australia\u2019s fire crews prepare for the return of El Ni\u00f1o [2023-06-10T00:00:07Z]": "Last week, people living around Darwin and Brisbane could see and smell the smoke in the air. It\u2019s an experience that will be mirrored across the country in the coming weeks as fire authorities and land managers carry out hundreds of controlled burns. Climate change has already lengthened Australia\u2019s fire seasons, with higher temperatures driving an increase in riskier fire weather. And with the landscape full of fuel after three wet La Ni\u00f1a summers, the risk of severe bushfires may rise if the predicted El Ni\u00f1o is realised, bringing hot and dry conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory if we get a big El Ni\u00f1o,\u201d says Greg Mullins, the former New South Wales fire commissioner. The three years of wet weather has also meant three years of reduced hazard reduction burning, he says.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Mullins was volunteering as a deputy incident controller for a planned hazard reduction burn last week across 400 hectares of Ku-ring-gai Chase national park, north of Sydney.   Related: Bureau of Meteorology puts Australia on \u2018El Ni\u00f1o alert\u2019    Hazard reduction burns can take place in forest understorey, grasslands and savannahs. Land managers and fire authorities prioritise areas close to communities or known spots where large fires can start, including along roadsides where the risks of accidental ignition from the public are highest. But authorities also need the right weather \u2013 not too windy, not too hot and not too wet. \u201cAs soon as you have a weather window, you jump on it,\u201d says Mullins. \u201cThe windows for hazard reduction are much shorter now, because the hot weather starts earlier. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s an opportunity you\u2019re going to find national parks, fire services will all be out there burning whatever they can.\u201d In New South Wales, the Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) and partner agencies have managed 58,591 hectares of controlled burns since last July to protect 93,523 properties \u2013 just 20% of what was proposed.    But 33,000 of those hectares were burned in the last month. Last week, 6,876 hectares of burns were earmarked around the Blue Mountains, Tenterfield, Coffs Harbour, the far south coast and Gunnedah. \u201cPeople won\u2019t have been smelling the smoke for the last few years,\u201d says Inspector Ben Shepherd, of the NSW RFS. \u201cBut as soon as opportunities present, we need to get in there ahead of the next fire season.\u201d \u201cWe know reducing the fuel reduces the intensity of bushfires,\u201d he says. Some areas targeted for burns are close to urban areas and inevitably the smoke affects people, he says, although steps are taken to reduce exposure. Smoke from controlled burns can be terrifying for Australia\u2019s 2.7 million asthma sufferers. \u201cBushfire smoke has high concentrations of small particles that travel into airways and trigger a response. The airways narrow,\u201d says Michele Goldman, the chief executive of Asthma Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty frightening experience for a young child, an older person or anyone with asthma.\u201d \u2018We just want people to be ready\u2019 As well as a possible El Ni\u00f1o, climate models suggest the Indian Ocean could enter a phase in coming months that raises the chances of drier weather for much of the country. The bushfires of 2019-20 came after years of intense drought. Mullins and Shepherd say they do not expect another black summer this year because of the amount of moisture still in soils and plants. \u201cWe\u2019re not coming out of drought, but we also don\u2019t want people to underestimate the potential for fires. We just want people to be ready,\u201d Shepherd says. Last week Brisbane woke to smoke haze after controlled burns in a section of the D\u2019Aguilar national park on the city\u2019s outskirts. The state\u2019s fire season generally starts in August \u2013 earlier than southern states. James Haig, the executive manager for bushfire mitigation at the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, says he has been talking to Bureau of Meteorology forecasters \u201cseveral times a day\u201d to find windows for burning. \u201cIf we\u2019ve got the chance of an El Ni\u00f1o then I\u2019ve been encouraging our partners to seize the window of opportunity, because you don\u2019t know what you are going to get. These windows can close very quickly.\u201d  Haig says firefighters accept that fire seasons are worsening.    In Victoria, Alen Slijepcevic, the deputy chief fire officer at the Country Fire Authority, says the state has already conducted half its planned burns for this calendar year, but it is too early to know how much extra fuel will be in the landscape when the fire season starts around the end of August. But changing fire seasons mean firefighters and agencies \u201care more reactive most of the time\u201d and have less time to take breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s now a 12-month business, whereas in the past it was a six-month job for firies,\u201d Slijepcevic says. \u201cThe evidence shows the fire season is 56 days longer in Victoria than it was 30 or 40 years ago.\u201d In South Australia, the Country Fire Service says it is too early to know what summer might bring, but fuel is accumulating, particularly in the Adelaide Hills. In Tasmania, early autumn is usually the best time for burning, with more predictable weather, enough dryness and atmospheric conditions that help smoke rise and disperse.   Related: Warning of unprecedented heatwaves as El Ni\u00f1o set to return in 2023    Jeremy Smith, the acting chief officer at Tasmania Fire Service, says: \u201cThe wet conditions in the eastern half of Tasmania have driven extraordinary growth in some of the state\u2019s highest bushfire risk areas, increasing fuel loads and bushfire risk.\u201d With drier conditions forecast, the fuel growth could lead to \u201cabove normal fire potential in some areas\u201d in spring. If an El Ni\u00f1o were to form, this could extend into summer, Smith says. Last week, the Australian and New Zealand national council for fire and emergency services released its bushfire outlook for the winter showing large parts of the central Northern Territory were already facing increased fire risk. Nathaniel Staniford, acting senior fire management officer at Bushfires NT, says La Ni\u00f1a years have left \u201chuge amounts of grass\u201d that landholders are trying to reduce with controlled burns. In Western Australia, planned burns usually occur from April to November in the south of the state and from March to June in the north. But rainfall there has been relatively average for the past three years, with La Ni\u00f1a having less of an impact.", "One town, one team: Hungry Cats create Geelong\u2019s defining era [2022-09-22T23:44:41Z]": "Geelong is a place that still has a sense of itself. Sure, Melbourne might be advancing down the highway, swallowing Werribee, sprawling towards Avalon in a way that could one day make the length of the Princes Highway a concrete conglomerate. But people from Geelong know that they are something different. They define themselves by it. Down that highway, out of the Melbourne footy fishbowl, Geelong Football Club offers one part of that sense of identity. Geography doesn\u2019t mean much in the AFL anymore. Modern-day Carlton is full of lawyers and the uni student children of wealth, not earthy Italian cafe owners shouting \u201cWoof!\u201d at Ang Christou. Collingwood, Richmond, North Melbourne, the ghosts of Fitzroy, all fuse into an inner-city conglomerate: the surviving commission flats form islands among the hipsters and artists who can still afford it and the rich dullards wanting that reflected coolness while complaining about the noise. Real estate parasites would place St Kilda, Essendon, Footscray, Hawthorn all within the most desirable inner band of a metropolis ballooning beyond. Most Melburnians who follow football now live in a Melbourne that football doesn\u2019t represent.   Related: Geelong book place in AFL grand final with thumping victory over Brisbane     South Australia got a generic Adelaide team, then an Adelaide suburb. Western Australia got a generic team that everyone knew was Perth, then a Perth suburb. New South Wales got a generic Sydney team with a Harbour Bridge motif, then another that is supposed to cover everything else from Redfern to Canberra. Queensland got a generic Brisbane team, and while the Gold Coast is a Geelong-like distance away, it is umbilically attached to the state capital in a way that the Victorian cities would never countenance. No one from Melbourne goes to Geelong voluntarily, and no one in Geelong wants them to come. All of which means there is only one rural or regional influence in an otherwise urban AFL. Geelong may have become a city itself, but it\u2019s still the home of the woolsheds, still the big smoke for the Western District, still a place that represents the Bellarine Peninsula down the coast or the endless pastures inland. Even as the kilometres spool out into hundreds to the south or west, the default option is to be a Cats fan: in Colac, in Horsham, in Warrnambool, in Ararat, down the Great Ocean Road. There is the country link with the club\u2019s stars: Billy Brownless kicking footies over a silo, Gary Ablett driving down from Drouin, Tom Hawkins beaming photogenically at his farm, Patrick Dangerfield lured back by the surf coast. These days, the Cats represents the concept of being regional rather than a region itself. Which all feeds into why Geelong the club means so much to Geelong the town. Kardinia Park has grown into a colossus, packed every second week through winter to create the only remaining intra-state home ground advantage in the league. Success in the AFL lays a marker for local strength. It is a smaller cohesive power showing the big cities that it can compete. Cohesion is what only a place like this can create. My main childhood memory of the 1989 grand final, more than the game itself, was all of Geelong decked in white and blue: streamers on trees, balloons in shops, drapery from windows. The solitary house dressed in brown and gold only emphasised how total the prevailing sentiment was. The solitary house got the win, and so began four grand final losses in seven years. There was plenty of local pride at the Cats\u2019 buccaneering style, but it also hurt not returning a premiership. By 2004 an upstart side was back in finals contention, and in 2007 the cup was won at last. All season the mantra had been to \u201ckeep the lid on\u201d. During the homecoming presentation the following day, someone who I don\u2019t recall remarked that the lid was last seen flying somewhere over Torquay. So began four grand finals in five years. This time, three of them were won. For supporters, contentment could rest easy at last. Also deeply satisfying was becoming a leading club in other ways. A \u2018no dickheads\u2019 policy meant that drafting relied on character as well as skill. Scandals all but vanished. The league\u2019s best recruitment and development program made gun players from low draft picks and discards and those outside the system. Teams evolved into new versions without collapsing down the ladder. Gambling revenue was evicted from the organisation. From an outside view, Indigenous players and staff became prominent on the inside. Coach Chris Scott exudes a sense of calm and decency. People who complain about free kicks for current captain Joel Selwood had to watch him on Brownlow night accepting the Jim Stynes Award for 15 years of community service. It\u2019s easy to say nice things about your club, but it\u2019s easier when the things are true. By 2022, Geelong supporters are hungry again, wanting reward for the new era that only features Scott, Selwood, Hawkins and Mitch Duncan from the 2011 premiership. It\u2019s funny: had the Cats been mid-tier since then, those previous three flags might still feel satisfyingly recent enough. But having stayed in contention ever since, a loss to Sydney this week would feel savagely like an era of opportunity wasted. Flags are not everything, but the best win-loss record in the competition over a decade without one is hard to understand. There was a strange upset to Fremantle in 2012, a missed kick in the last minute of the 2013 prelim, out in straight sets in 2014, and several knockout torchings in years to follow. The 2020 grand final was strange - shortened quarters played in Brisbane during lockdown against a Richmond side in its own pomp - but a third-quarter lead was still an opportunity lost. This season is back to normal, back to the MCG at last, and the Cats have clearly been the best team of the year. This is the one that they should and must bring home, for this era to feel worthwhile. Although, no matter the result, the crowds will turn up to Kardinia Park again to start next year. They are Geelong, after all.", "The NDIS is no help if it limits us more than our disability does | Pete Mailler [2022-06-17T20:00:23Z]": "I was 15 when my right leg was amputated through the knee. I am not an amputee who farms; I am a farmer who happens to have one leg. I do not differentiate myself based on my limitations and I don\u2019t want others to either. I just get on and do what is required. I am also a national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) participant but, with all the good intentions behind the scheme, I\u2019ve come to understand it is hopelessly flawed. In my experience, the current culture of the administrator of the NDIS \u2013 the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) \u2013 curbs peoples\u2019 opportunities by focusing on and rewarding limitations. This is the opposite of what it was intended to do. According to its website, \u201cthe NDIS is designed to help people get the support they need so their skills and independence improve over time\u201d.    If I lead with my disability, it is all that people see    But in order to get necessary support, we have to explain and demonstrate how disabled we are, how needy we are, how much of a burden we are going to be to the rest of society. Most people see disabled people as something less, but I have refused to let my disability define me. If I lead with my disability, it is all that people see. So if we support people with disabilities, we must ensure the bureaucracy does not limit them more than their disability really does. Consider my story. My amputation was necessary due to ongoing complications from the otherwise successful treatment of a rare and aggressive cancer at two years old. The orthopaedic surgeon informed me at the time that I was very fortunate because 15 was the best age to lose a leg. I was a little dubious that there was a best age for something like that.   Related: \u2018Desperate for staff\u2019: the NDIS crisis afflicting regional Australians    When I was about 17, I was assessed by a commonwealth medical officer and deemed to be disabled enough to qualify for the disability support pension. I was told at the time that I was only 15% as capable as an able-bodied person. That doesn\u2019t leave me wondering how I have done what I have done. It makes me wonder why able-bodied people have done so little. I took the disability pension while I went to university. I ultimately wanted to prove that all those who sought to limit my potential based on their perceptions were wrong. I can\u2019t say with any certainty that I have achieved all that I could in life. Like everybody, I know there are things I could have done differently and better. Nonetheless, I did realise my \u201cunrealistic\u201d ambition to farm and, for the most part, I have been pretty good at it. I definitely married up, and we have great kids. I have been active in advocating for better outcomes for my community and industry. I have found my physical limit a few times. I am not stupidly proud. I take help when it is offered. I did access available government support to get prosthetic limbs, as well as making my own contribution. Then, in early 2017, a polite lady rang me and advised me that my region was being transitioned on to the NDIS. She advised I would need to be assessed to determine my eligibility to participate in the scheme. I asked what the criteria were and she replied that I would need to be permanently disabled. She said that she had my records from the Queensland Amputee Limb Service. I asked, \u201cSo you know I am an amputee then?\u201d She responded with a yes. I asked: \u201cYou know legs don\u2019t grow back, right?\u201d Things went downhill with the NDIS from there. I was assessed. This included a sit-down interview for several hours with three able-bodied women I did not know. I wore a pair of shorts so that they could see I was an amputee, but that wasn\u2019t enough. They insisted on discussing how I dress myself, how I use the toilet and even my sex life. It took nine months for the NDIA to agree I was eligible to participate in the scheme and then two years of arguing about what they would fund, before they would fund anything. They were very keen to install handrails in my toilet (which I didn\u2019t need) and very reluctant to fund the computerised knee that was prescribed by two separate prosthetists (which I did need). In the end, I had to start the process of taking the NDIA to court to get funding approved for the necessary tech for my prosthesis. I had to navigate these processes largely on my own. I learned quickly that being based in regional Australia was a major disadvantage to participating in the scheme. The NDIS was rolled out in capital cities first. It was far easier to get technology funding approved at the beginning of the rollout. Regional participants were instantly at a disadvantage by late entry. By then, there was a growing concern about the true cost of the scheme and a much more conservative attitude to funding prevailed. In regional areas, there is a much lower level of support because there aren\u2019t enough participants in many regions to encourage or justify the same level of service as there are for city-based participants. As a result I was disadvantaged, not only because I live in the bush but also because I was late to enter the scheme. Ironically, I was then further penalised because I had worked so hard doing what I could with my life that they argued I wasn\u2019t really in need. Once the funding was approved, it clearly made a difference. Before the new knee was fitted, I fell almost daily while working. Since the new knee was fitted, I wouldn\u2019t fall even monthly. The outcome of poor biodynamics associated with being an amputee means I am getting old faster than my mates. Beyond this, the injuries I have sustained from falling over at work for over 30 years have taken their toll and my physical working life is now limited. My amputation has finally started to disable me. There is no doubt that if I had been able to access better tech sooner, my working life would have been extended. There would have been a better return to the taxpayer if they\u2019d enabled me to work longer, rather than the dumb argument that because I was \u201chigh functioning\u201d I wasn\u2019t deserving of further support. Sometimes people condescendingly ask me how I do what I do. I started by thinking that I could. I don\u2019t think I have done anything remarkable.

Prof Lesley Hughes asked her own institution, Sydney\u2019s Macquarie University, to pull out of hosting one of the events for the Santos Science Experience, arguing the company\u2019s expansion plans were putting children\u2019s future at stake. In a move to apparently appease critics, organisers have established a parallel event \u2013 The Science Experience \u2013 dropping the Santos name, but with only Macquarie University and the University of Tasmania listed as hosts.   Related: Australia is funding just one-tenth of its fair share of global climate action, study finds    Hughes told the Guardian: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t enter into a year 10 science experience program sponsored by [cigarette maker] Benson &amp; Hedges. I don\u2019t think that should happen for an oil and gas company either.\u201d The Santos Science Experience charges year 9 and 10 students between $65 and $260 to attend programs running from one to four days at more than a dozen universities and other institutions. It starts next week and goes until the end of the year. A web archive of the Santos Science Experience from late March shows Macquarie University as a participating institution. But the university told the Guardian it was now hosting the students under the banner \u201cThe Science Experience\u201d, which would be supported by the event\u2019s not-for-profit organisers, the Victorian-based Science Schools Foundation. That foundation is also organising the Santos events. Hughes is a high-profile and accomplished scientist who this week was confirmed as a new member of the government\u2019s Climate Change Authority that will advise the Albanese government on emissions targets. She said she had spoken with colleagues after seeing an email asking academics to get involved. \u201cI said I personally thought the university shouldn\u2019t be working with a fossil fuel company that\u2019s looking to explore for more fossil fuels. \u201cI also don\u2019t think [Santos] should be sponsoring a science program when the science is clear that we can\u2019t have any more oil and gas exploration if we want to get to net zero. \u201cThe paradox here is that they are hosting a high school science program when the science is so clear and it is those kids\u2019 future that is at stake.\u201d According to the Santos Science Experience website, students do experiments, attend site visits and hear about careers in science, technology and engineering. Dozens of universities and tertiary colleges are hosting the Santos-branded events, including the University of Technology Sydney, the University of South Australia, the University of Melbourne, RMIT and the University of Sydney. Macquarie was listed on the official event website as host for a three-day event from 4 October. But on Thursday \u2013 the same day the Guardian asked about the event \u2013 Macquarie\u2019s name disappeared. The national director of the Science Schools Foundation, Jacqueline Bellars, said the event would go ahead at Macquarie and no children would be disappointed. She directed questions about any criticisms of the sponsorship to Santos and the university. She said the program for each event was set by the hosts and they were geared to encourage young people to explore a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) and expose them to life in university or tertiary education. She said the Santos lead sponsorship began in 2020, taking over from previous main backer ConocoPhillips \u2013 another oil and gas company.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  In a statement, Macquarie University said its \u201cinvolvement with this event is focused on the promotion of science, so a decision was made to proceed with our Science Experience event without any sponsorship or branding from Santos\u201d. \u201cThe Science Experience held at Macquarie is an important opportunity for high school students, including rural, regional and Indigenous students, to engage with Stem,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe activities taking place at Macquarie on 4-6 October are now being supported by the Science Schools Foundation.\u201d   Related: Australian parliament passes first climate change legislation in a decade    A Santos statement said: \u201cSantos is proud to fund this initiative that helps more than 3,000 children each year engage in science activities, and we have been doing so since 2013.\u201d Santos is also a prolific sponsor in the sports world, appearing on the back of the Australian and Queensland Reds rugby union team shirts. The gas company also sponsors the road cycling Santos Tour Down Under. The event has come under sustained pressure from protesters over the sponsorship, with some professional cyclists calling for an end to the deal. Senator David Pocock, a former Wallaby, has compared the company\u2019s sponsorships to the era when tobacco companies used sports sponsorships to try to retain social legitimacy. Earlier this year Tennis Australia confirmed it had dropped Santos as a major partner just one year into a multi-year sponsorship deal.", "\u2018Like an ocean\u2019: Molong devastated by deluge with more NSW towns hit with fresh flooding  [2022-11-14T04:42:54Z]": "Residents have described how flood waters moved through the small rural town of Molong in central-west New South Wales \u201clike an ocean\u201d, flooding homes and businesses overnight. \n\u201cIt is horrific, like Molong is devastated and every single business has been affected today,\u201d publican Kim Stojanov, who owns the Freemason\u2019s Hotel with her husband David, said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky no one was killed.\u201d \nDavid Stojanov was trapped on the pub\u2019s balcony on Sunday night as flood water rushed down the street. \n\u201cThey were actually quite scared at one point on the veranda because of the containers and the things that were coming their way, like it was going to take the posts out,\u201d Stojanov said. \n\u201cThen that was smashing into the posts on the side of the pub, and they were actually quite concerned that the pub was going to get taken out. \n\u201cIt\u2019s either going to make or break you, and unfortunately, I think it\u2019s broken us.\u201d \nDozens of people sheltered at an RSL overnight, as vast swathes of the central-west were battered by rain and powerful storms, with the force of the flood waters smashing shop windows and knocking out the back wall of the local supermarket. \n\u201cFour to five business windows were smashed, refrigerators have been ruined, the pharmacy, supermarket and newsagent have gone under,\u201d business owner Robert Carrol said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re only a small town, it is literally one main street, and we\u2019re rallying together today, but it\u2019s just devastating, it\u2019s hard to see friends and colleagues so hurt.\u201d \nStojanovic said the damage from the flooding was worse than the devastating flood seen in the town in 2005. The fast-moving water cracked the windows of businesses along the main street and destroyed houses. \n\u201cWe all were in there last time [in 2005] for the cleanup,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to be honest, I don\u2019t know if I could handle it this time. \n\u201cThere\u2019s containers that went through houses.

It roared through the town, it was like an ocean.\u201d \n\u201cIt was pulling up huge trees and dragging them through town. We had some sandbags set up, but they just did nothing, so much of the main street is ruined.\u201d \n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much devastation, in the short term, there\u2019s no fuel, no supermarket, no restaurants, it\u2019s completely ruined the town.\u201d \nHe said that while power had been restored to some sections of the town on Monday afternoon, residents were still taking stock of everything that was damaged. \n\u201cWe saw people crying, gutted at it all, they put everything into those shops. We\u2019re pulling together now, that\u2019s how country towns are, but some people are just distraught.\u201d \nState emergency services and Fire and Rescue crews have arrived to help with the massive clean up, as the water continues to recede. \nIt comes after both agencies worked through the night, doorknocking homes, beginning evacuations and helping the ADF rescue people stranded on roofs. \nAbout three-quarters of the historic town is damaged, with numerous roads ripped up and the new hockey field destroyed. \nFire crews also rescued two people and their dog from knee-deep water inside a house, another couple from the top floor of a motel and waded through chest-high water with a police officer to reach another woman stranded in her inundated home. \nAt least two large shipping containers were carried through the centre of the historic town by flood waters and are blocking the Mitchell Highway. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nPremier Dominic Perrottet urged people in flood-hit areas to follow emergency warnings, saying they were not released \u201cfor the sake of it\u201d. \nSean Kearns, NSW SES assistant commissioner, said there was still concern for Molong, Eugowra, Canowindra, and Condoblin in particular, while warning that rivers and catchments have been quick to flood due to the ongoing rain. \n\u201cWhat we are seeing at the moment is any reasonable amount of rain is actually leading to flash flooding which can catch people out unawares,\u201d he told ABC News. \n\u201cThe predictions we have are that this is going to continue for months. Some of these communities are going to keep on getting impacted as the rain comes and there\u2019s predictions that it\u2019s going to be quite a wet summer, at least until the end of December.

The party\u2019s \u201csocial work\u201d style doorknocking campaign \u2013 focused on building relationships and listening to voters\u2019 material concerns rather than spruiking \u2013 proved wildly successful in Brisbane, culminating in the capture of three federal seats. Now, the Greens are planning to vastly expand the strategy\u2019s footprint, to take on political contests in the outer suburbs. \u201cOnce you have that experience [of successfully engaging a voter], you realise that the only barrier to expanding our representation is our capacity to organise,\u201d says Max Chandler-Mather, the architect of the strategy and the new federal MP for Griffith. \u201cWhat\u2019s proven with our campaign methods is that where we\u2019re able to do that sort of community organising and door-knocking, our vote surges. \u201cThat organisational foundation we\u2019ve built is going to allow us to project out across the state quickly.\u201d Bringing the Greens\u2019 brand of environmental socialism to the aspirational suburbs might sound unrealistic \u2013 these are the \u201cbattlers\u201d who backed John Howard, the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d who delivered Scott Morrison his 2019 election victory, the \u201cworking families\u201d forever courted by Labor and the \u201cforgotten\u201d folks at the heart of Peter Dutton\u2019s Liberal recalibration. But potential Greens voters?   Related: Queensland Labor turning green at the prospect of losing city stronghold    For the three Greens MPs who won Brisbane seats at the 2022 election \u2013 Chandler-Mather in Griffith, Elizabeth Watson-Brown in Ryan and Stephen Bates in Brisbane \u2013 the evidence they collected at people\u2019s front doors has opened up all sorts of possibilities that might otherwise (like the idea of winning three Queensland seats) be dismissed as fantasy. The Greens\u2019 success was built partly on the political mobilisation of the renter class, but also service sector workers, people worried about the cost of living and families with concerns about their children\u2019s financial future. Often climate was not the main topic of conversation. \u201cSocially, that suburban layer is crucial to us,\u201d Chandler-Mather says. \u201cThis concept that we should be getting our fair share from mining corporations, that billionaires and corporations should pay their fair share in tax \u2013 when you speak to people in suburban areas and rural and regional communities \u2013 is broadly popular. \u201cThe key component of all of our cost-of-living policies is abolishing means testing. This concept that you have a social right to dental care, you have a social right to free university education, allows us to build very broad-ranging class coalitions because you appeal to a politics that Labor used to represent but no longer does.\u201d Bates says middle-class voters \u2013 in areas of his seat that were considered Labor or Liberal strongholds \u2013 were mostly \u201cexcited\u201d about the idea of universal social services. \u201cWhat I found people resented was paying their taxes for something that is so heavily means-tested they\u2019ll never be able to access it. People feel that class resentment,\u201d he says. \u201cThey feel like they\u2019re paying into the system, but not getting out of the system what they need or what they want.\u201d    \u2018People wanted hope\u2019 Watson-Brown, an architect whose electorate stretches from Brisbane\u2019s inner west to some semi-rural areas, says her interactions with voters became almost \u201clike a counselling session\u201d. \u201cEvery time we spoke to someone at a door, we could draw a direct line to the challenges they were experiencing in their life to what the Greens could offer in terms of help and hope,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the absolute power of it. People wanted hope. People have been beaten around the head for quite a few years now.\u201d Central to the campaign was what Chandler-Mather describes as a \u201cfeedback loop\u201d that attempted to take language from community conversations and embed it in the campaign. \u201cVolunteers often see words or phrases or ways of describing things they\u2019ve used end up in our political advertising,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the reasons that it cuts through so much is that it\u2019s language that people in the community use. \u201cThe one slogan we used a lot in Griffith was \u2018nothing changes if nothing changes\u2019. That only emerged because some random person said it to me trying to describe what I was trying to say. It worked really well.\u201d Do they sometimes feel a bit like the Mormons, turning up on people\u2019s doorsteps?    For us, the wins are foundation stones upon which to move to the next stage of party organising  Max Chandler-Mather     \u201cNo, because it\u2019s never, it\u2019s never superimposition,\u201d says Watson-Brown. \u201cOur Labor dude was lurching towards people [at polling booths] saying things like, \u2018help me deliver my comprehensive plan\u2019. \u201cWe\u2019re asking what you care about, what\u2019s going on in your life. It\u2019s deeply meaningful.\u201d The true effectiveness of the strategy seems to be that the major parties haven\u2019t yet worked out how to respond. Attack lines have repeatedly proved ineffective. In Queensland state politics, Labor argued that the electorate of South Brisbane would be better served by a progressive voice in government \u2013 the former deputy premier Jackie Trad \u2013 than a rock-thrower from the outside. During the Griffith campaign, Labor rolled out posters claiming that only it could rid the country of Scott Morrison. \u201cWhat was implicit in those sorts of messages was ceding the entire political ground on the platform,\u201d says Chandler-Mather. \u201cThere was an acceptance that our platform was better. We didn\u2019t have to counter severe misrepresentations about how preferential voting works, we just had to say \u2018dental into Medicare\u2019 or \u2018free uni and Tafe\u2019. The relentless positivity of our campaign comes precisely because people are fighting for something they believe in.\u201d A template for further expansion It\u2019s tempting to view the Green wave in Queensland as something that will continue to grow, as it has since the 2016 election of Brisbane councillor Jonathan Sri, two state MPs and now three representatives in Canberra. But there are risks, too. The Greens still cop criticism for the 2009 decision to vote against Labor\u2019s carbon pollution reduction scheme; and some claim they bear responsibility for the subsequent 13 years of fraught climate politics. The former member for Griffith, Labor\u2019s Terri Butler, conceded last week by wishing her successor luck in \u201cin delivering on all the promises he has made\u201d. The message was clear. Campaigning is one thing, especially when you have no chance of being in government. But once you\u2019re in, people are going to want their problems solved.   Related: Listen, engage, show you care: how Greens and independents took local politics all the way to Canberra     In all three Brisbane electorates won by the Greens, airport noise was a significant issue. Do voters now expect them to achieve something? \u201cThey expect us to drive that campaign,\u201d Chandler-Mather says. \u201cPeople asked us all the time, \u2018What happens if you don\u2019t get into the balance of power?\u2019. We were very open about the fact that political change takes time, but at the very least it starts with representatives who are committed to driving community campaign building. \u201cPeople are expecting us to fight for it. People understand that these things are difficult, they take time. But they also realise they\u2019ll never happen if you elect representatives who are opposed to the things they want.\u201d The foothold of three federal MPs\u2019 offices now gives the Greens a base from which to spread their campaigning. It acts as a sort of proof of concept for progressive Labor voters \u2013 that Greens can win contests and effectively shift the political debate. The fact the Queensland Labor party has responded by underlining its progressive and environmental credentials in some ways only proves the point that Greens\u2019 wins can shift the dial. \u201cThat foundation of wins builds confidence that the Greens are able to win,\u201d Chandler-Mather says. \u201cThere are two component parts I always feel to winning a vote, and that is relating on material concerns, but also confidence that you\u2019re voting for a political movement that is capable of eventually building some form of power. Those wins begat wins, and they build confidence that that next layer will come to us. \u201cThis can be a template model for what we can expand across the country. So for us, the wins are foundation stones upon which to move to the next stage of party organising.\u201d", "Inland rail: federal government won\u2019t reassess business case despite cost blowout warnings [2022-01-28T03:21:52Z]": "The federal government will not review its business case for the inland rail project, rejecting any reassessment as \u201cnot an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars\u201d, despite cost blowouts identified by a Senate inquiry into the major infrastructure project.  The Senate report, released in August 2021, called on the government to update the 2015 business case undertaken by the former Nationals leader John Anderson, which originally estimated the cost at $4.7bn. The inland railway is now budgeted at $14.5bn, although the Senate inquiry heard expert opinion that costs could exceed $20bn.  GUARDIAN INVESTIGATION: Trouble on the tracks: is Australia\u2019s $14bn inland rail project going off the rails?  A new business case was one of 26 recommendations from the Senate report. But the government supported only 11 recommendations in its response, released quietly in the week before Christmas. However, the government response said it would not support the recommendation to update the 2015 business case, as it \u201cdoes not accept that further review of the route or business case for Inland Rail is needed or would be an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars\u201d. The government response said its project was driven by increasing freight needs over the next three decades.

A National Trunk Rail spokesman told the committee in January last year that the estimate of $20bn \u201cmight be on the low side,\u201d warning that it was likely additional funding announcements would be made because \u201c[t]here is a huge amount still unaccounted for \u2013 a huge amount.\u201d The report also found \u201cone of the key critiques directed at the Inland Rail has been whether the project remains viable if demand for coal declines or whether restrictions are imposed on the movement of coal along the Inland Rail alignment\u201d. The NSW Farmers Association and Country Women\u2019s Association were successful in getting the government to support a recommendation that the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) engage an independent mediator to facilitate an improved working relationship with the two groups.

The federal government is instead relying on the NSW government\u2019s environmental approval process for inland rail which includes an independent review by a hydrologist of the ARTC\u2019s flood modelling as a mandatory requirement of an environmental impact statement. However, as Peter Holt, the lawyer engaged by the NSW Farmers Association and CWA, told Guardian Australia in its major investigation into the infrastructure project, the environmental impact statement currently being exhibited \u201coperated at a very high level of generality\u201d and landholders\u2019 serious concerns about flooding remain unresolved. The government also rejected a recommendation to establish an independent comparative review of the current Narromine to Narrabri alignment with the proposed Dubbo-Coonamble line and alternative routes around Narrabri, taking into account both the impacts and potential broader economic benefits for regional economies and communities.    The government cited \u201ceven a small increase in distance and transit time translates into an increase in operational costs for Inland Rail users\u201d. Adrian Lyons, the chair of the NSW Farmers inland rail taskforce, said he was hopeful that the deputy prime minister and infrastructure minister, Barnaby Joyce, would demonstrate that he was willing to fix the issues clearly outlined. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. Yet again, communities were ignored in favour of future ribbon-cutting opportunities for politicians,\u201d Lyons said. A spokesperson for the deputy prime minister told Guardian Australia the government had agreed to the majority of the review\u2019s recommendations, which responded to a range of stakeholder concerns.

The government supported 11 recommendations, supported four in principle, noted five and rejected six, including the most substantive first three recommendations regarding the costs and the business case. The spokesperson said there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for not supporting certain recommendations. \u201cThere are always competing demands when it comes to the development of national infrastructure projects and these are considered in the context of the significant benefits they deliver,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cInland rail will create thousands of jobs in regional Australia and generate new economic opportunities for our exporting businesses, helping them grow and drive our economy forward.\u201d Danica Leys, the CEO of the CWA of NSW, said they supported the project, but desperately needed a recalibration of how it was implemented. \u201cThe Senate inquiry report provided a great template for that to happen. The federal government, however, have really missed the opportunity to rectify wrongs and get this project back on an even keel,\u201d Leys said. \u201cIt was disappointing for us, and for the communities and individuals impacted, to see such a dismissive response to the Senate report.\u201d   Related: Australia\u2019s inland rail: a long-held dream, but for whom and at what cost?    The government also rejected a recommendation for an ongoing inquiry for oversight of the inland rail project on the grounds that the ARTC, as a commonwealth company, was already subject to a range of oversight mechanisms, including regularly appearing before the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. Senator Glenn Sterle, the chair of the inquiry, described the government\u2019s response as \u201cvery poor\u201d and called on the Coalition to support all the Senate inquiry\u2019s recommendations. \u201cThey\u2019re not Glenn Sterle\u2019s recommendations.

But as Covid and flu-related illnesses sweep across the nation, he is finding himself taking classes once a week. \nAs the head of Maryborough Education Centre \u2013 a government school in central Victoria \u2013 juggling principal duties and the occasional lesson is the new routine for Sutton. But he is most concerned about his assistant principals now teaching additional classes to help plug gaps caused by ongoing vacancies. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a really big ask and they step up because it\u2019s the type of people they are \u2013 but it does create pressure,\u201d he says. \n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the additional stress that [staff] are faced with because it\u2019s uncertain when they come to school which classes they\u2019ll be taking. We operate with a lot of goodwill and dedication but we need to be understanding that this will have an impact.\u201d \nThe prep to year 12 school, two hours\u2019 drive north-west of Melbourne, also caters to students with disabilities. One specialist teaching position for students with disabilities has remained unfilled since the beginning of the year. \nIn government and independent schools around the nation, the teaching workforce is facing a twofold crisis. Covid has wrought havoc and worsened existing shortages that predate the pandemic. Flu and Covid-related illness have resulted in classes being combined or cancelled, principals filling in teaching roles, and students \u2013 particularly in remote areas \u2013 being taught maths by non-specialist teachers. \nGuardian Australia revealed in March that more than 4,000 extra high school teachers would be needed nationally over the next four years, with New South Wales and Queensland forecast to experience the biggest shortfalls. The figures \u2013 from federal government modelling \u2013 also showed more than 50,000 teachers were expected to permanently leave the profession between 2020 and 2025, including almost 5,000 teachers aged between 25 and 29. \nAt Maryborough Education Centre, the ongoing vacancies point to a wider workforce crisis. Sutton says while specialist subjects such as maths and languages have always been challenging to fill, in the past 18 months the regional school has had persisting vacancies \u201cacross the board\u201d. \nThe workforce shortages predate Covid and are well-documented, with teachers reporting feeling overworked, underpaid, struggling with poor behaviour of students and burdened by administrative tasks even before the pandemic began. \nThe principal of a public school in western Sydney, who requested anonymity, says shortages have worsened in the past three years, highlighting a deeper structural issue. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t find a casual teacher for love nor money,\u201d she says. \nThe principal says a head of faculty recently left the school after spending months taking extra lessons and preparing lesson plans for casual staff. \n\u201cIn the end it had a toll on his health, his life after school and was impacting his family,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a difficult and heartfelt conversation about him saying, \u2018I can\u2019t do this for my own health and have to leave the profession\u2019.\u201d \n\u201cI lost a wonderful teacher and the department lost a wonderful resource.\u201d \n Interactive \n \nDuring the election campaign, federal Labor unveiled a scheme to financially incentivise high-achieving school leavers via $10,000 a year bursaries to study teaching in a bid to tackle shortages. \nThe new federal education minister, Jason Clare, tells Guardian Australia that teacher shortages are a \u201cmajor issue\u201d that will be high on the agenda at the next meeting of education ministers. \n\u201cWe committed at the election to help tackle this issue by providing bursaries for 5,000 talented students to enter teaching, and expanding the High Achieving Teachers program to support up to 1,500 professionals working in other fields to switch careers to teaching,\u201d Clare says. \nThe national education union is calling for a coordinated national plan to tackle the shortage crisis as a matter of urgency, warning it cannot continue as teachers, principals and support staff are at risk of severe burnout. \n \n  Related: NSW and Victoria to push Albanese government to close public school funding gap  \n \nA Victorian government spokesperson says it will back a national plan to reduce workforce shortages. \n\u201cWe know we have a genuine partner in education in the Albanese Labor government,\u201d the spokesperson says. \nA Monash University study published last month found more than half of the 2,444 Australian primary and secondary school teachers surveyed were planning to quit the profession, describing their workload as excessive and unsustainable. They felt burned out and unable to keep up with the growing list of administrative tasks. \nThe NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, does not mince his words when he says he has never seen principals and teachers \u201cso angry and exhausted\u201d. \n\u201cWe need to tackle the crippling workload. If you know the cause of the problem you know the solution,\u201d he says. \n\u201cThe other issue is creating a competitive salary to attract and retain teachers.\u201d \nThe NSW government this week announced public sector workers such as teachers would receive a pay rise after it agreed to lift a cap on wages to 3% \u2013 up from 2.5%. But the teachers union says it \u201cadds insult to injury\u201d, as it falls short of inflation, which soared to 5.1% in the March quarter. \nIndependent Schools Australia\u2019s chief executive, Margery Evans, acknowledges there is no silver bullet, but says schools should consider ways to reduce workloads by having more non-teaching staff taking on administrative tasks. \n\u201cPositive culture in schools is another thing, ensuring teachers have a voice and a say and a feeling of efficacy in their work and workload management,\u201d she says. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe Queensland Teachers Union president, Cresta Richardson, says the pathway forward required assisting expat teachers return home and offering financial and lifestyle incentives for qualified overseas teachers to take up positions. \n\u201cIn the meantime, we need to give students a reason to take up teaching as a career and clearly demonstrate why it\u2019s so meaningful and respected,\u201d she says. \n\u201cMost importantly we need to reward and retain the teachers on the frontlines right now, we simply can\u2019t lose any more.\u201d \nThe NSW government last year launched a teacher supply strategy to tackle the projected shortfall. The scheme aims to provide 3,700 extra teachers over the next decade by improving perceptions of the profession and fast-tracking the careers of high-performing teachers. \nIn Victoria, the state government has a targeted financial incentive scheme for hard-to-fill positions. \nThe Victorian teachers\u2019 union president, Meredith Peace, backs bursaries as financial incentives but says further investments are needed to support country students afford to study teaching in regional hubs or cities. \n\u201cThose kids are more likely to go back and teach in country areas because they understand what it\u2019s like to live in the country,\u201d she says. \nAt Sutton\u2019s school in regional Victoria, the housing supply crunch is an additional barrier for people on student placements. He also stresses that investing in expanding regional placements is key to tackling regional shortages. \n\u201cTeaching in a region can be a highly rewarding career but many people studying teaching will not experience a regional placement,\u201d he says. \n\u201cWe need to give financial support so the pre-teachers get the chance to see all the benefits of teaching in the country.\u201d", "The nosebleed seats: Barnaby Joyce\u2019s return to centre stage was always going to be unpredictable [2022-05-11T17:30:42Z]": "It started with a sniff.

Peter Costello got stuck in a lift in 2007 before the Coalition lost government to Kevin Rudd. There is a weird parallel. The nosebleed seats are far from centre stage. In this election, the deputy prime minister has stayed far from the main election media circus. At one level, this is entirely expected, because the seats that concern the National party leader are far from metropolitan areas. His circuit includes the swag of seats in central Queensland as well as Labor\u2019s seat of Hunter in NSW and Lingiari in the Northern Territory. The Victorian seat of Nicholls has also seen Joyce a few times, but less so than the northern seats, where his Big Hat persona plays better. The Nationals currently have 16 lower house seats and Joyce wants to pick up Hunter and Lingiari to both win government and ward off any unexpected leadership tension. The other reason he keeps his head low is that the teal independents, and some of the rural ones too, are using his name in campaigning. \u201cA vote for the [insert Coalition MP] is a vote for Scott Morrison and Barnaby Joyce\u201d is regularly trotted out. So Joyce\u2019s visage is not welcome in every electorate. Indeed, the big change in this election is that some rural electorates may not be buying the bloke Tony Abbott once dubbed the \u201cbest retail politician\u201d. So when he burst back on to centre stage to address the National Press Club, it was always going to be unpredictable. It was an easy audience, given the room was stacked with National party supporters, old and new campaign directors, various lobby groups, grifters, spinmeisters and a few innocent bystanders.   Related: One Nation has changed, says Barnaby Joyce, as he preferences them second on how-to-vote card    There were also working journalists who were trying to discern some meaning from his speech.

But he refused to countenance showing journalists or his own constituency what the Nationals negotiate under the Coalition agreement. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to ventilate every iteration, every nuance day by day,\u201d he said. Climate change remains a tricky dance for Joyce, as he tried to describe how his government\u2019s own so-called safeguard mechanism would, in Labor hands, be a carbon tax. (The safeguard mechanism requires polluting companies to buy carbon credits or reduce their emissions). Regional areas, he said, \u201cread transition as unemployment\u201d. \u201cWe have a safeguard mechanism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the ceiling on this. It\u2019s out of the way but it stops you going through the roof. They [Labor] are going to bring the ceiling down to about head level for tall people. And about 215 [companies] are going to start belting their heads on the fans and the lights and being fatally attacked based on that.\u201d Infrastructure, which took up a large part, included mentions of the $5.4bn Hell\u2019s Gates dam, announced in March without a business case or environmental approvals.

Documents obtained by the Guardian show more than 4,000 extra high school teachers are needed nationally over the next four years, with the biggest shortfalls predicted in New South Wales and Queensland. A separate internal NSW Department of Education briefing shows the state-wide shortage is expected to be most severe in science and technology subjects, in rural, regional and remote schools, and in lower socio-economic areas. The national forecast said the secondary teacher shortage would jump above 9,000 across Australia if schools only relied on domestic \u2013 and no international \u2013 students. While most states and territories are expected to have a shortage of secondary teachers, a glut of more than 8,000 primary school teachers is predicted across the country within four years. The federal government also expects more than 50,000 teachers to permanently leave the profession between 2020 and 2025, including almost 5,000 teachers aged between 25 and 29. The NSW Teachers Federation head, Angelo Gavrielatos, described the situation as a \u201cperfect storm that cannot be denied any longer\u201d. \u201cThe sooner all governments stop the denial, the better we will be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cause is uncompetitive salaries and unsustainable workloads. If you know the cause, you know the solution. Fix it.\u201d The workforce modelling was completed by the federal Department of Education and circulated to state and territory education ministers to be discussed at an upcoming meeting. It was sent in draft form to the NSW state government and obtained by the Guardian.

The federal Department of Education said the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, has been leading the conversations with ministers \u201cto better understand teacher workforce issues\u201d nationally \u2013 a task usually left up to the states. \u201cThese discussions have resulted in the department undertaking modelling of teacher demand and supply, which has been tested with jurisdictions and the non-government schools sector,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. The NSW education department documents show one in five students in regional parts of the state are now being taught maths by a non-specialist teacher, while 70,000 students could be affected by shortages by 2030. Briefings provided to the NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, in 2021 warned the department needed to find an additional 4,100 teachers this year, with severe shortages in some regions. While the state could meet teacher shortages \u201cat an aggregate level\u201d, a shortfall of 800 Stem-qualified teachers meant that about 40,000 students were being taught by \u201cout-of-field\u201d teachers in 2022. In total, the department warned, one in eight secondary students across the state would be taught by \u201cout-of-field\u201d teachers in 2022. The predicted shortfalls come amid rising concern over the longevity of teachers across the sector, with many reporting feeling overworked even before the pandemic.   Related: \u2018Clash of two crises\u2019: fears for NSW schools as Covid pandemic and ongoing teacher shortages collide    A study released by a federal government body in December found a quarter of teachers said they intended to leave the profession before they retired and more than half of those planned to leave within the next decade. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) research found one in three teachers under 30 \u2013 and almost 40% of teachers aged between 30 and 39 \u2013 intended to leave the profession in the next decade. Low pay, heavy workload, stress and an inability to control the student population were among the top reasons given for planning to leave. The briefings to the education minister warned the shortage was particularly acute in regional parts of the state, where out-of-field teaching is as high as one-in-five. \u201cStem-qualified teacher shortages could affect as many as 70,000 students each year by 2030,\u201d the briefings warned. \u201cThe situation is particularly acute in rural and regional areas, where out-of-field maths teaching is currently as high as 22%.\u201d The shortfall of teachers in NSW has been well documented. In January Guardian Australia revealed 70 public schools across the state had staff vacancy rates of 20% or higher, while there were 3,300 vacant teaching positions across the state in October last year. Last year the government announced a new Teacher Supply Strategy to provide 3,700 extra teachers over the next decade. The strategy aims to address shortages in the profession by recruiting teachers from interstate, improving perceptions of teaching by funding a marketing campaign and accelerating the careers of high-performing teachers. In a statement, the state education department said the government was \u201con track\u201d to meet its 2019 target of an additional 4,600 teachers over four years.   Related: The Gonski \u2018failure\u2019: why did it happen and who is to blame for the \u2018defrauding\u2019 of public schools?    \u201cThe department acknowledges the specific challenges facing specific subject areas in certain locations across the state, and is implementing a range of targeted scholarships and incentives to attract Stem teachers where they are needed most,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. But the strategy has been criticised by the NSW Teachers Federation for failing to address teacher pay. Since 2011, the NSW government has capped wage increases for public servants at 2.5%, a measure that has prompted increased hostility from unions who say pay has not kept pace with rising cost-of-living pressures across the state. In the briefings obtained by the Guardian, the department provided talking points to the minister on a number of questions relating to teacher pay, including: \u201cNSW teachers are among the lowest paid in Australia. Why is this the case?\u201d and \u201cTeachers play such a critical role which isn\u2019t reflected in their pay. The profession is undervalued \u2013 why can\u2019t the government just lift the cap?\u201d. The briefings blame the shortfall on a lack of qualified teachers in particular subject areas (such as Stem), the difficulty of providing staff to schools in regional or remote parts of the state and what it described as an \u201cincreasing\u201d difficulty in finding casual staff to plug holes. On the latter, the department warned shortages of casual teachers had been exacerbated by their use as part of the Covid Intensive Learning Program, a $383m program placing extra teaching staff in classes to help address education shortfalls resulting from the pandemic. It also cites \u201chigher sick leave\u201d among casuals. But the minister defended teacher paying, saying public school teacher salaries were \u201ccompetitive with those offered by other state education systems\u201d. \u201cIn 2011 the annual salary for teachers at the top of the salary scale was $84,759,\u201d her spokesperson said. \u201cIn 2022 the band 2.3 annual salary is $109,978. Over the last 11 years the classroom teacher salary at the top of the scale has increased by $25,219 which represents a 29.75% increase from the 2011 salary.\u201d", "Victorian government fails to respond to cannabis and homelessness inquiries before deadlines [2022-09-07T17:30:12Z]": "The Victorian government has failed to respond to formal recommendations that it consider legalising cannabis for personal use, improve conditions for homeless people and expand access to school buses, in a breach of state parliament\u2019s rules. The recommendations form part of seperate inquiries tabled in parliament last year, which the government hasn\u2019t responded to within a six-month deadline. A response to the 500-page inquiry into homelessness \u2013 which called on the government strengthen early intervention services and provide more secure, long-term housing for homeless people \u2013 is a year overdue. The government is also seven months late in responding to an inquiry into cannabis use. The inquiry recommended the government consider legalising cannabis for adult personal use, under a similar model to that used in the ACT, where people are allowed to possess, use and supply small quantities of cannabis, as well as to cultivate two plants per person at home.   Related: Seachangers and migrants have transformed Victoria since 2018. What does that mean for the election?    Fiona Patten, the chair of Legislative Council\u2019s legal and social issues committee that led two of the inquiries, said the government was \u201cshowing significant hubris\u201d by failing to respond. \u201cNot to mention it\u2019s actually contemptuous of the parliament to refuse to respond to these reports,\u201d Patten said.    Patten said the homelessness inquiry was one of the most comprehensive she has been involved in during her eight years in parliament. It took more than two years to complete, with 450 formal submissions and 18 hearings, the majority of which took place during Covid-19 restrictions. \u201cFor the government just to ignore that body of work is completely disrespectful to all of the hard work that the community and the committee put into that really important inquiry,\u201d she said. Transport Matters party MP Rod Barton was instrumental in establishing the homelessness inquiry and another into taxi industry reform, which was tabled in parliament in November 2019, making the government\u2019s response 18 months overdue. He said he requested the government \u201ctake their time\u201d in drafting a response to the latter but didn\u2019t expect it would remain unaddressed with one sitting week remaining of the term. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want them to respond in the middle of everything that was happening with Covid-19, but that was in early 2020. Now it\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe are five minutes from wrapping up and nothing\u2019s been done.\u201d Barton said he was also concerned about the government\u2019s nine-month delay in responding to an inquiry into the public use of school buses in rural and regional Victoria. \u201cOpening up that service to the public will do an enormous good for people in those areas suffering loneliness, who can\u2019t get a job or access education, just because they don\u2019t drive,\u201d Barton said. Three other parliamentary inquiries, examining environmental infrastructure for growing populations, the health impacts of air pollution and ecosystem decline in Victoria, have also not been responded to within the legislated timeframe. A spokesperson for the government said it is considering the reports and will table responses as they are finalised.

Louise Staley, the opposition\u2019s spokesperson for government scrutiny, said the failure to respond to the inquiries forms part of a consistent \u201cpattern\u201d of the government dodging accountability and transparency. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen with the triple zero report, this government will go to extraordinary lengths to hide bad news,\u201d Staley said. \u201cThe reports cover a wide variety of topics and have been undertaken diligently.

[2022-01-24T16:30:21Z]": "The inland rail is a political dream that winds back into pre-federation days. The first version was laid out by Henry Parkes in his Tenterfield address of 1889, as he made the case for a national government. Such a move would also need a national army and a \u201cnationwide uniform gauge railway line\u201d. Parkes wanted to connect South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland by rail, \u201can immense advantage in the movement of troops\u201d. More than 100 years later the modern founder of the inland rail, Everald Compton, took his dream to John Howard. He envisaged a railway to service country areas and link farmers to ports.  Guardian investigation: Trouble on the tracks: is Australia\u2019s $14bn inland rail project going off the rails?  Compton\u2019s 1996 plan went from Melbourne via Parkes and Goondiwindi to Toowoomba. From there, the line would run to the port of Gladstone before setting off across country to Emerald and ultimately Darwin via Cloncurry. The current route promises an express service to deliver freight from somewhere outside Melbourne to somewhere outside Brisbane in less than 24 hours \u2013 not counting truck connections. It is based on a 2015 business case by the former Nationals leader John Anderson, costed at the time at $4.7bn. In the 2017 budget, the then treasurer Scott Morrison announced an $8.4bn equity injection into the Australian Rail Track Corporation as \u201cone of the biggest investments ever seen in regional Australia\u201d, supporting 16,000 jobs. As an equity injection, it was not counted as part of the budget deficit. Morrison promised the line would benefit \u201cnot just Melbourne and Brisbane, but all the regions along its route\u201d. But last year\u2019s Senate inquiry into the inland rail told a different story. It found \u201cthe interests of rural, regional and urban communities throughout Victoria, NSW and Queensland have been sidelined by an arbitrary time threshold\u201d \u2013 the 24-hour window to deliver freight from end to end. It was critical of the government\u2019s reliance on a 2015 business case while costs had risen to $14.3bn. It noted predictions were now closer to $20bn.    \u201cWhether Inland Rail\u2019s 2015 business case remains valid in light of the substantial increase in capital required for its completion is a key question,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt is the committee\u2019s view that this substantive increase in the cost of Inland Rail alone warrants a review and update of the 2015 business case.\u201d The interim chief executive for ARTC Inland Rail, Rebecca Pickering, said in a statement that the ARTC recognised some parts of the freight industry and communities living along the route felt their views had not been adequately considered.    Young Indigenous people are trying to hold on to our heritage while ARTC is whittling it away.  Taje Fowler     \u201cWe have heard the call from stakeholders who expected more from our early engagement on Inland Rail and we have continued to improve as the project progressed,\u201d she said. \u201cBuilding Inland Rail is about working together and our priority is to continue to work with landowners, key stakeholders and government through respectful engagement and consultation.\u201d ARTC\u2019s latest projection is for 21,500 direct and indirect jobs to be created by the inland rail project. \u201cIn fact more than 2,500 Australians have already worked on construction of Inland Rail and more than $150m has already been spent with local businesses \u2013 we expect these benefits to be duplicated along the railway alignment,\u201d Pickering said. Who is the line for? Critics have called the project a National party \u201cboondoggle\u201d, pointing out that Anderson\u2019s business case found it would not make money back over 50 years. Certainly, the rail has been pushed by National party leaders since Anderson, and former leader Warren Truss is currently chairman of the ARTC. One fundamental question rolls up and down the 1,700km route \u2013 who is the line for? NSW Farmers Association\u2019s Adrian Lyons, who has led campaign to ensure farmers are fairly treated, says there is still no clear economic and social justification for the rail line and no clear value back to agriculture. His members have had properties cut in half and have warned ARTC and the federal government that flooding issues will create havoc for the line. \u201cThey are playing politics, they are not looking for the 100 year vision, they are looking for the now,\u201d says Lyons. \u201cWe have done everything we possible can, attended the enquiries, written submissions but when it does get going, all we will be able to do is say we told you so, on the flooding. You will get what you pay for.\u201d Others support the idea of inland rail but see the current plan as a missed opportunity. They point to the uncertainty surrounding the route which has left landholders bearing the cost of changing decisions and in some cases unable to sell their properties.    There is also a lack of clarity about where the line will end in Melbourne and Brisbane. If it does not go direct to their ports, which would entail huge costs, they would need to unload their goods at the final terminal and send them by truck the rest of the way. And there are cultural concerns. Taje Fowler, a descendant of the Wurundjeri nation with family connection to the Wiradjuri nation and who has family in Narromine, says \u201cyoung Indigenous people are trying to hold on to our heritage while ARTC is whittling it away\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to see the project is still going ahead without the steps being put in place to do it the right way. \u201cAs a First Nations woman it is my cultural responsibility to protect the land \u2013 we have around 2% of untouched land left in the central west.\u201d But above all there is a lack of transparency around the choice of the route and where trains will stop, leading to scepticism and frustration. The chief executive of the Country Women\u2019s Association, Danica Leys, says the benefits to many agricultural areas would be far outweighed by the costs. \u201cThere are whole towns and communities that are watching the rail line go past but not having a point anywhere near them to onload or offload agriculture produce,\u201d she says. \u201cThey take the brunt of the burden of this infrastructure without being able to get anything from their region on the train.\u201d The late Tim Fischer, another former National party leader and a rail buff, supported the line but said the beneficiaries would be the big freight companies in Melbourne and Brisbane and logistics hubs such as Parkes. \u201cThere will be zero advantage for the small railway siding towns, even the ones with extended passing loops, other than the construction phase of inland rail and the upgrading to the standards necessary,\u201d he told the ABC in 2017. The coal connection Other industries also have a strong interest in the line. Coal is expected to be a major freight item, according to Anderson\u2019s 2015 business case. \u201cThe coal task in 2025 represents over half of the total demand for Inland Rail by volume,\u201d he found. And when the Santos coal seam gas project at Narrabri was approved by the NSW government, the Nationals MP for Parkes, Mark Coulton, said gas combined with the \u201ctransformational inland rail\u201d would give the town the potential to be \u201cone of our significant manufacturing hubs\u201d.    Coulton has supported inland rail since his first parliamentary speech. He believes support for it will increase as compensation rolls out and the route is finalised. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the people that are the most outraged that are the most disadvantaged,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. With the terminal location in Brisbane still unconfirmed, the current National party leader, Barnaby Joyce, has proposed instead extending the line from Toowoomba to Gladstone and has committed $10m to a business case which will cost the extension.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter      Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter   A spokesperson for Joyce said the link to Gladstone \u201ccould deliver better rail connectivity and expand access to export markets for regional Australian agricultural and mineral commodities along the route\u201d. \u201cOnce complete, Inland Rail will move goods and commodities around Australia to where they are needed \u2013 putting stock on supermarket shelves and food on plates while ensuring our mining and agriculture products can continue to be sold internationally to support regional jobs and communities.\u201d At 90, Everald Compton remains wedded to the cause \u2013 but not in its current form. He still receives letters from communities along the route who are being torn apart by the project. \u201cPeople would be willing to make sacrifices for a rail that\u2019s going to help them, but not for a rail that\u2019s not going to help them at all,\u201d he says. \u201cThe National party is supposed to be there to enhance inland Australia.

There are no journalists located there, just local Facebook groups.\u201d The slow disappearance of local news is being tracked by the Public Interest Journalism Initiative\u2019s Australian Newsroom Mapping Project. Last month the project revealed that 6.3%, or 33 local government areas, had no local print or digital news coverage. \u201cFacebook and WhatsApp groups can be awesome sources of very local information during emergencies from people who know backroads and ways to get around issues,\u201d Wake said. \u201cThey became absolutely vital during the bushfires and now the floods. But they also aren\u2019t run by professionals and not always updated in real time. \u201cThey can degenerate into unseemly battles where mud-slinging and personal grievances come out. They can also post seriously out-of-date information or fake information, potentially causing bigger problems for authorities.\u201d   Related: Ballina flood: thousands of homes impacted with \u2018peak to continue for a number of hours\u2019    In Kingscliff, population 11,000, the local Facebook group has more than 30,000 members and is administrated by journalist of 30 years and former editor of the Tweed Coast Weekly Tania Phillips.

At the time, she wrote on LinkedIn that the award was recognition \u201cnot so much for me but that we need journalism in small towns and regions, that it needs not to be dictated by outside sources and featuring stories from elsewhere to pad it out, but run by communities for communities. That\u2019s how we survive \u2013 real journalists. I\u2019m still working on how I feed my family!!\u201d But not every town is lucky to have someone as experienced as Phillips at the helm. Wake says she would not want to be a local Facebook administrator right now. \u201cImagine someone posting that they were in a life-and-death situation and you\u2019re just a mum sitting at a computer a suburb away with no power to help.

", "The floods prove volunteers can only do so much when the government goes awol |  NSW Rural Fire Service volunteer [2022-03-15T02:42:02Z]": "Watching the flood waters rise in the Northern Rivers, Queensland and far western Sydney last week, I\u2019ve had a horrible sense of deja vu. Dread. Exhaustion. Abandonment. And a rising, furious anger. I\u2019ve been a New South Wales Rural Fire Service volunteer for several years. My unit is based in the Blue Mountains. In late 2019, I was involved in what is now called the Black Summer. These floods are horribly reminiscent of that time. Not just because of the scale of the disaster, but because people in some of the worst circumstances imaginable have, again, been abandoned by the government.   Related: Emergency chiefs slam Coalition\u2019s \u2018fumbling\u2019 response to floods, claiming they were warned of a potential crisis    Over Black Summer, the prime minister went overseas for a holiday. He should have been in Australia, if only to demonstrate support for the communities that were really suffering. It was an insensitive thing to do \u2013 especially when people like myself were giving up time with our kids to protect our communities. I can only talk for myself, but I was baffled that there was so little support for RFS volunteers and our communities from the federal government. Seeing the scenes from Lismore and Brisbane and Richmond over the last week, I get the same feeling. The months of Black Summer were the hardest of my life. Not just because of the fires, or the fear and devastation I saw in the towns, or the nights, days and weekends away from my kids. As the months dragged on, and me and my mates exhausted ourselves trying to defend or save what we could, I was thinking: where\u2019s the government? When are they coming to help? Why are we on our own? Firefighting and preparation is some of the most backbreaking work you can do. Imagine hacking defensive lines through the scrub, backburning in dense bush, dragging heavy equipment through difficult, dangerous terrain to put out fires and doing most of that in heavy PPE and thick smoke. None of that was surprising \u2013 it comes with the job. But the length and intensity of that fire season was something else. For weeks on end, I spent every moment I physically could on the fireground. When I couldn\u2019t do that, I helped people in the community prepare or went to my full-time job. I spent New Year\u2019s Eve patrolling a defensive burn. I\u2019d get stopped on the street by people who wanted to know what was happening. There was no downtime. Life became a blur. I barely saw my kids although it was school holidays. I ran out of paid leave, so I took unpaid leave. That was a financial hit. There\u2019s little else you can do when your community is at risk and when your mates are as tired as you are. There\u2019s no one else to do it. This is no criticism of the RFS. The RFS was amazing. I always felt supported and still do. They did an unbelievable job with the resources they had. The communities, too, were unbelievable \u2013 you have no idea how much that meant. People brought us home cooked meals. Kids drew pictures. Everyone knew that season was above and beyond. But volunteers need time to heal. Seeing burnt-out houses and hearing stories of people dying to defend their homes, seeing that level of fire intensity and living on high alert for months scars you. It feels like a lifetime and several world-changing events away, but Black Summer was only two years ago. That\u2019s another reason I think these floods are so frightening. They\u2019re evidence that climate change is already here, and we are nowhere near prepared for it. Anyone on the ground will tell you that the summers are getting hotter, and the fires are getting worse. We\u2019ve had at least four major catastrophic fires in recent history. Climate change means the old volunteer model we\u2019ve used for decades to respond to natural disasters isn\u2019t as effective. It was never designed to tie people up for weeks or months at a time. Many volunteers are older too; there\u2019s only so long they can do the physical work the RFS requires. Listening to politicians talk about people being \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cresilient\u201d makes me so angry now. We are tough, but we\u2019re human too. We have families and responsibilities that we can\u2019t just set aside. When a disaster like Black Summer or these floods happens, community spirit only gets you so far. We need dedicated government support \u2013 not just more funding and bodies on the ground, but a wholesale reassessment of what disasters from now on are going to look like, and what we\u2019ll need to help people through them.   Related: Roads ripped apart by NSW and Queensland floods must be rebuilt stronger, councils say    We also need a government that finally bites the bullet and admits that corporations burning coal and gas are heating the planet, which is killing people and destroying entire communities.  Australia is the third-largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world \u2013 behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. Pretending that our massive coal and gas exports aren\u2019t fuelling these disasters is unbelievably cynical. I want a government that helps me to help my community when we need it. People want to help their neighbours. It\u2019s a natural instinct. But to just expect regular people to do all the work without backing them to do it is crazy. It feels like, on a fundamental level, the government just doesn\u2019t get that. I hope I\u2019m wrong. I hope that the floods wake us up in a way the fires didn\u2019t. When the election comes around, I hope people remember who turned up to help, and who didn\u2019t. \u2022 The writer is a RFS volunteer in western Sydney and a GetUp member.

The government announced on Monday night it would use a little-known section of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to establish what are known as regional plans. Under the law the environment minister may create regional plans and exempt certain developments \u2013 such as mining or agriculture \u2013 from the requirement to gain individual federal environmental approval in areas covered by a plan. The government has committed $62.3m in the budget to establishing plans in up to 10 yet-to-be-chosen regions as part of its push to reduce environmental bureaucracy. The announcement is part of a larger $128.5m package that also includes $37.9m for further streamlining of environmental assessments and $12m to modernise environmental offsets policy.   Related: Sussan Ley does not have duty of care to protect young from climate crisis, appeal court rules     The Wilderness Society (TWS) said it was deeply concerned the Coalition was pledging funding with the apparent aim of \u201ccircumventing environment protections for some of Australia\u2019s most iconic and sensitive natural landscapes and wildlife\u201d. \u201cGiven the government\u2019s track record, we\u2019re concerned that this seems like yet another step towards granting an industry free-for-all [rather] than an effort to protect nature,\u201d said Suzanne Milthorpe, the national environment law manager for TWS. Since last year, legislation that would clear the way for the government to hand its environmental decision-making powers to state and territory governments has been blocked by the senate, in part because the Morrison government has not adopted a set of national environmental standards recommended by a review of national laws. Milthorpe said the new announcement was \u201cconsistent with the continued attempts to get around the parliament and effectively achieve bilateral agreements by stealth\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been 20 years of government reviews, audits and state of the environment reports all saying the one thing: Australia\u2019s wildlife and natural landscapes are being destroyed because our environment laws are being sidelined in favour of fossil fuel and developer interests.\u201d At a media conference in Mackay in Queensland on Tuesday, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said if implemented, regional plans would have the effect of completing the environmental assessment and approval stages upfront, \u201crather than every single project starting their homework from the beginning\u201d. She said it would give developers assurance their projects could proceed but there would be \u201cno backwards step\u201d for the environment. \u201cEvery part of this announcement is about making the environment more protected \u2026 but also recognising the effect that those awful delays have had on jobs and development,\u201d she said. Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said the changes would \u201chelp provide greater certainty for businesses to invest in regional Australia, supporting local communities, jobs and furthering sustainable development\u201d. Andrew McConville, the chief executive of the oil and gas industry\u2019s peak body, the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association, said the announcement would result in \u201cbetter environmental protection while reducing the costly regulatory burden on business\u201d. The government has not announced any of the locations for its proposed regional plans, though the resources minister, Keith Pitt, has signalled his desire for Queensland\u2019s Bowen basin to be considered. Establishing the plans will not be straightforward and will require cooperation from the relevant state or territory governments. Federal environment department officials told a senate estimates hearing last month that the location for a proposed pilot of a regional plan \u2013 funded in last year\u2019s budget \u2013 still had not been chosen because conversations with a willing state or territory had not advanced. Freedom of information documents released to Guardian Australia last month show environment officials, as well as stakeholders who were consulted late last year, have also asked how compliance with environmental law would be enforced under a regional plan. In responses to separate questions from Guardian Australia, Ley\u2019s spokesperson said the locations would be finalised after further discussions with the states and territories and would be selected across \u201cdiffering bioregions and geographies\u201d. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) called for more information from the government about its proposed regional planning approach and where the 10 priority areas would be. Sophie Power, the ACF\u2019s biodiversity policy adviser, said regional planning had merits if it was used to improve the environment of a whole area. \u201cWe are concerned the government\u2019s approach appears to focus on making things easier for resource extraction industries, rather than protecting nature,\u201d Power said.

She said it had been more than a year since the federal government received the final report from the Samuel review, which found successive Australian governments had failed to protect the environment. \u201cTo this day, the Morrison government has still not formally responded,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, we now see it has focused on looking to exploit a loophole in the EPBC Act to allow major projects to bypass federal environmental assessments through regional plans.\u201d Vassarotti said the federal approvals process was important because it helped put environmental assessments by state and territory governments in a national context. \u201cWhile regional plans could in principle be a useful tool \u2026 the agenda for this announcement is entirely skewed towards removing this national context and relying solely on individual jurisdictional analysis.\u201d", "Revealed: how a crafty Labor move on the NBN is being used to win over voters [2022-05-14T20:00:10Z]": "It seemed like an innocuous amendment to an obscure piece of legislation. But when Labor in May 2020 quietly amended a government bill on funding for NBN Co\u2019s regional expansion, the opposition was actually laying the groundwork for a policy it hoped could win over crucial city voters in the federal election, which was then two years away. Now, a week out from polling day, a Labor source has revealed for the first time the lengths the party went to in order to develop its National Broadband Network policy. When it comes to the NBN, data is always key. Labor wanted to know, once the network rollout was completed in 2020, what improvements could be made. Specifically, the opposition was keen to upgrade as many homes as possible from fibre-to-the-node (FttN) to fibre-to-the-home (FttH) as cost-effectively as possible. The biggest hurdle, however, was the lack of data. Other than NBN Co\u2019s website \u2013 where you can plug in an address and see the technology type \u2013 there was no Australia-wide data on what technology was being used, house by house and suburb by suburb. A third party had managed to scrape the data from NBN Co\u2019s website manually, but it wasn\u2019t 100% accurate.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning.   This takes us back to May 2020, when the government was rushing to pass legislation that would tax fixed-line networks to help pay for NBN regional networks. Labor was willing to support the legislation \u2013 but with some minor amendments. One of the amendments added in the Senate required NBN Co to provide mapping data about every NBN-serving area module within 150 days. The data would show the dominant technology type used and the date people could order a connection in that area. The Labor source says the Coalition didn\u2019t raise any objections. The opposition wasn\u2019t sure whether the government understood, at the time, the true intention of slipping the amendment into the bill. But, six months later, the data was uploaded to the government\u2019s National Map website. Anyone could now overlay maps of which technology type was used in every part of Australia.    The data allowed Labor to do a spatial density analysis of homes within fibre-to-the-node areas and determine where it was most cost-effective to upgrade the connections. NBN Co then started announcing which 2m homes it would offer fibre upgrades too \u2013 but Labor was already ahead of the game. The Coalition had promised to add 2m premises at a cost of $2.9bn. But Labor was able to determine an additional 1.5m homes could be upgraded for a further $2.4bn. The opposition pledged to move 3.5m premises in total from FttN to fibre-to-the-home at a cost of $5.3bn. Beyond that 3.5m figure, the spatial density dropped off quickly and it was much more expensive to upgrade, the data obtained via Labor\u2019s legislative amendment showed. The data means Labor, during the campaign, could provide precise local upgrade numbers to its candidates on the hustings. The shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has posted on her Facebook page that 106,000 homes in western Sydney will be upgraded to full fibre under the plan, including 15,000 in her electorate of Greenway, for example. Labor deliberately announced its NBN policy in November 2021, well before the election, to give the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, plenty of time to look for any holes in it. (He wouldn\u2019t be able to ask NBN Co to crunch any numbers once the campaign started and the government was in caretaker mode.)   Related: What party is ScoMo in? What is a corflute? Who should I vote for and who will win? The top Google searches of the Australian election    Fletcher made some vague claims about Labor\u2019s upgrades targeting marginal electorates and being wasteful spending. But he didn\u2019t highlight any substantial issues with the opposition\u2019s policy. Guardian Australia contacted Fletcher\u2019s office for comments and was directed to NBN Co. As a government-owned business, it said it was unable to comment while the government was in caretaker mode. The suburbs set to benefit the most under Labor\u2019s policy are not the most marginal. The plan would more than double fibre-to-the-home in the safe Liberal-held seat of Flinders and the Labor-held seat of Newcastle, according to modelling seen by the Guardian. Under the Coalition\u2019s policy, the Labor-held seat of Perth and the Liberal-held seat of Leichhardt would receive the greatest number of upgrades. South Australia and Tasmania are the two states set to benefit the most from Labor\u2019s upgrade. Under the announced Coalition plan, to date, about 29% of FttN premises are set to get an upgrade in those two states, compared with over 50% in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and WA.", "Seats to watch: the electorates that could decide who will win the federal election [2022-05-21T08:20:56Z]": "With opinion polls suggesting a close contest between Labor and the Coalition at the federal election on 21 May, the final result could come down to a handful of seats. \nHere are the federal seats to watch as the election results come in: \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nNew South Wales \nHunter \nHunter is a rural seat in coal country that covers Cessnock, Singleton and Muswellbrook.

Mobile internet coverage is almost nonexistent across large swathes of the Northern Rivers and phone reception is intermittent. Credit card payments are also unable to be processed, with most businesses only accepting cash. Some have been offering free food as a result, a welcome gesture in towns where supermarkets and shops have bare shelves due to cut off supply routes.   Related: Fears for Indigenous community of NSW island as anger rises about government\u2019s flood response    In Mullumbimby, a queue stretched out of the Commonwealth Bank branch on Thursday morning as it opened for the first time since flooding earlier in the week. Tellers were manually recording customers bank account information and limiting cash withdrawals to $500. Communication issues have meant some families were unable to stay in contact with relatives who had evacuated, access news about road closures or contact insurance companies. Cadwallader has called on Telstra to set up a mobile phone tower in the region, saying the internet outage is shutting families off from friends and loved ones when they most need to talk.   Related: Woman gives birth after being rescued from Brisbane floods by neighbours and a kayak    \u201cWe need a Telstra tower now, a mobile Telstra tower,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get pockets of power restored, but that [the mobile tower] is the most essential thing, because it\u2019s hampering rescue efforts. And from a community perspective, kids that are holed up, they can\u2019t play internet games, they can\u2019t talk to their friends, their mums and dads can\u2019t talk to their friends.\u201d Tanya Phillips in Kingscliff said she hadn\u2019t had phone service since Monday and internet since Tuesday. \u201cWe were really in a communication black hole,\u201d Phillips said after having had to leave home to work in Tweed Heads where she has finally been able to get a signal. \u201cIt has been difficult. There\u2019s been family worrying about us,\u201d she said.  Phillips said many people were calling the evacuation centre at Kingscliff to find out news, to check \u201cif dad made it or if mum is there\u201d.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Telstra said most of its sites in Ballina were \u201cstill providing some mobile coverage\u201d. It said it was otherwise making progress in restoring mobile and landline services across south-east Queensland and northern NSW. \u201cWe know this a difficult time and we are working to get everything back up and running as quickly as possible and as soon as it is safe to do so,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe have technicians on the ground in areas we can access and we have more ready to go as soon as other areas open up.\u201d \u201cMany areas are however still inaccessible due to flood waters or are without power, including Ballina.\u201d The spokesperson said temporary mobile facilities still required power and access to an area before they could be deployed. Acting chief executive of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, Andrew Williams, said the group\u2019s main concern is that communications outages, particularly mobile, could prohibit people making emergency calls when flood waters encroach.   Related: \u2018We are doing our best\u2019: rescuers fear for animals injured in NSW and Queensland floods    Williams said the mobile tower\u2019s battery back up can only last for a certain period of time and if operators can\u2019t get in to resupply generators with fuel, nothing can be done until flood waters recede. Williams believes telecommunications need to be listed as an essential service so that priority can be given to ensure telecommunications be restored as a matter of urgency, backup battery times increased, and priority access to fuel for emergency generators. The Regional Telecommunications Independent Review occurs every three years. The 2021 Regional Telecommunications Review report released on 14 February this year emphasised the effects of several natural disasters across the country and that \u201caccess to reliable telecommunications services has never before been more important to regional, rural and remote Australians.\u201d The report noted that in the 2019-20 bushfires, the 2021 eastern Australia floods and Cyclone Seroja, and during the Covid-19 pandemic \u201cregional Australians relied on mobile, landline and broadband networks for real-time information, access to emergency services, contact with loved ones, and resources to support post-disaster recovery\u201d. For Phillips, who is the main administrator and editor of the community facebook group Kingscliff Happenings (Coojingburra), the lack of connection has made it difficult for her to provide the essential service messages to the community. \u201cThings change so fast. We need to be putting things up on the site in real time because old news can be dangerous.\u201d In order to post this week, Phillips said she would gather information from police at the evacuation centre, then borrow a phone with an Optus simcard to text another moderator on the other side of the river who still had internet. \u201cEverybody was relying on whoever had an Optus phone. Optus seemed to be the only one working. If we could have flipped over and used Optus or Vodafone, services aren\u2019t great but it would have been better,\u201d Phillips said. Mark Gregory, a professor in telecommunications at RMIT said the current disaster was a perfect example of why the government needs to adopt the recommendation in the regional telecommunications review that they explore domestic roaming in emergency situations. \u201cIf an Optus tower fails, people in that area can use a Vodafone or Telstra tower so customers can still get access to the network, to call for help or be able to contact family and friends,\u201d Gregory said. He said the government hasn\u2019t yet responded to the report but that the recent flooding \u201cprovides strong grounds for the government to accept that recommendation and act on it.\u201d", "Victorian authorities say residents in Kerang face being cut off for a week after SES conducts 650 flood rescues [2022-10-17T05:47:58Z]": "Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced a $351m emergency package to begin flood recovery in parts of the state, as residents in the rural town of Kerang are urged to leave or risk facing more than a week of isolation. \nOn Monday there were 60 warnings issued across the state, including evacuation orders for Charlton on the Avoca River, Bunbartha in Greater Shepparton and Echuca along the Murray River. \nState Emergency Service (SES) chief of operations, Tim Wiebusch, urged those in Kerang on the Loddon River in northern Victoria to consider relocating given they faced the potential of being cut off by flood waters for more than a week. \nThe river is expected to peak at 78 metres above sea level in Kerang, about 280km kilometres northwest of Melbourne, on Wednesday or Thursday. \n \n  Related: Victoria floods: nervous night in Shepparton but Goulburn River peaks lower than expected  \n \n\u201cThe community is now preparing themselves, and the roads will be sandbagged to join up the levees around Kerang and at this stage at the height that we\u2019re expecting of 78 meters [above sea level], we do expect Kerang to be able to remain dry,\u201d Wiebusch told reporters on Monday. \n\u201cBut it will be isolated. We\u2019re asking the Kerang community to consider whether they should now be moving to another location, given that peak is expected Wednesday into Thursday.\u201d \n \n Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup \n \nWiebusch said the Campaspe River at Echuca would remain at a major flood level for 24 to 48 hours. \n\u201cThat means there are still around 1,200 properties [in Echuca] that are either isolated or have some level of inundation, either on the property and a number of times above the floor,\u201d he said. \nAuthorities said the Murray River was expected to peak at 95m above sea level on Tuesday, which could cause damage to 1,000 to 2,000 properties in the area. \nMerinda Slater lives on the western side of Echuca, which has been \u201csplit into two towns\u201d by the rising river. \nSlater said that once the alerts came through warning of evacuations the supermarket shelves were \u201cstripped bare\u201d. \n\u201cIt\u2019s doomsday behaviour, there\u2019s no bread, it\u2019s like Covid,\u201d she said. \nWiebusch, however, said there was some \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d for Shepparton and Mooroopna. \nOn Sunday it was forecast up to 7,300 properties could be inundated, with predicted river heights of 12.2m on Goulburn River at Shepparton. Instead, it peaked at 12.05m on Monday morning. \n\u201cThat 15cm makes a significant difference to the number of properties either isolated or impacted, so we believe around 4,000 properties are now either isolated or have some levels of inundation,\u201d he said. \nMost residents from the Aboriginal community of Cummeragunja, on the banks of the Murray on the border of NSW and Victoria, evacuated on Monday. \nBelinda Day works for the local Health and Development Aboriginal Corporation and told Guardian Australia that residents initially feared leaving their homes and wanted to stay. \n\u201cThe majority had elected that they were going to stay on country but we\u2019ve had New South Wales police out this morning doing door knocking advising that it is actually a mandatory evacuation.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re going to either relocate themselves to family or friends or they\u2019re going to go into Moama and access the evacuation centre there and seek some support,\u201d Day said. \nThe Campaspe River near Rochester was starting to recede, allowing for impact assessments to begin. It was thought 85% of properties in the rural town \u2013 up to 900 homes \u2013 had been inundated, Wiebusch said. A 71-year-old Rochester man died in floodwaters in his backyard on Saturday. \nSES members have completed more than 650 flood rescues since the flood event began last week and have responded to 6,000 requests for emergency assistance. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nSpeaking at the state\u2019s emergency control centre on Monday, Andrews said $165m would be spent on an emergency road repair blitz, which had already begun, to fix potholes and repair road surfaces. \nThe funding would also cover larger-scale works, including the rebuilding of roads, bridges and culverts, particularly in the Hume, Loddon Mallee and Western regions, which have been the worst affected to date. \nAndrews said the immediate focus was making key roads safe so emergency services and vital supplies can reach affected communities ahead of more rain forecast later in the week. \n \n  Related: Victoria floods: nervous night in Shepparton but Goulburn River peaks lower than expected  \n \nClean-up efforts had also begun in Maribyrnong, Melbourne, where police are investigating reports of looting. \nThe emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said a flood victim who had evacuated last week had returned home to find they had been burgled. \nPolice were on Monday looking for a blue Ford Territory which pulled up outside a Burton Crescent home at around 7am on Monday. \n\u201cWe see the absolute best in behaviour across all of our Victorians,\u201d Crisp said. \u201cSadly, we also see the absolute worst in behaviour.\u201d \nCrisp said more than 100 Australian defence force troops had been deployed to flood-affected areas. \nThe premier said more than 11,000 people had applied for emergency support payments since they opened on Friday. \nOn Monday federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said modelling indicated more than 9,000 homes were flooded in northern Victoria and more than 34,000 homes across the state could be flooded or isolated with water or isolated. \n \n  Related: \u2018Just too much rain\u2019: small-town Australians survey damage after massive flooding  \n \nAn emergency re-establishment assistance fund will also provide up to $42,250 for uninsured properties. \nThe Victorian opposition welcomed the funding but continued to call for the government to declare a natural disaster to provide certainty and unlock further funding and support from the commonwealth. \nHowever, Crisp said there would be \u201cno benefit whatsoever\u201d to declare a state of disaster at this stage. \nAndrews said the state and federal governments were working to finalise disaster recovery funding arrangements. \n- With AAP", "Rising food prices hit every supermarket aisle putting pressure on low-income families [2022-07-10T04:13:57Z]": "The price of food has continued to rise, with new data showing that every supermarket aisle has been hit by hikes, not just fruit and vegetables. The soaring prices have led researchers to call on the federal government to help subsidise growers, amid concerns it\u2019s costing some lower socioeconomic families 40% of their income to buy a week\u2019s worth of healthy food. Comparing the cost of 28 staples between June 2020 and June 2022, researchers from Deakin University\u2019s Institute for Health Transformation found that the price of lettuce and broccoli had the biggest jump, increasing by more than 100% within two years. In 2020 a head of lettuce would have cost $2.50, but now costs more than $5, and broccoli jumped from $5.90 to $11.90 a kilogram.   Related: \u2018As bad as it was during lockdown\u2019: NSW food banks battle to keep up with demand    Tomatoes saw the third-highest jump, going from $6.90 to $9.90 a kilogram over two years, but it wasn\u2019t just fruit and vegetables, with Christina Zorbas, a researcher at Deakin University, calling the increase a \u201ccrisis\u201d. \u201cDairy produce, yoghurt and cheese, meat \u2013 chicken and mince, bread, pasta and rice \u2026 have gone up 5% to 10%,\u201d she said. Zorbas said every aisle is being affected by large price hikes \u2013 except for junk food. The price of some pasta like spaghetti increased by 13%, potatoes went up 12% and milk went up 9%. The research showed a litre of olive oil went from $12 to $16. \u201cThe consumer price index that got released in the last quarter shows fruit and vegetables went up 7% across the board everything else went up 4%,\u201d Zorbas said. \u201cYou see the disparity between healthy and less healthy, takeaway foods have gone up by 1%.\u201d There were a few vegetables that bucked the trend \u2013 the price of carrot, onion and sweet corn stayed steady. Some fruits decreased in price such as oranges, which have gone from $3.50 to $3.22 a kilogram in two years, and Apples which have dropped from $5.50 to $4.50. The recent floods in New South Wales and Queensland, coupled with the increase in the cost of fuel due to the war in Ukraine, have meant almost everything is more expensive at the moment. Zorbas said the increasing prices have \u201cexacerbated health inequality\u201d and called on the government to subsidise growers until the crisis was over. \u201cWe need subsidies going towards farmers that produce healthy foods,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sugar industry is heavily subsided, the farmers need money so I\u2019m not against it, but it is the same way that the fossil fuel industry is heavily subsidised. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we be giving more money to farmers who make the food that is so important for health and wellbeing?\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Before the pandemic, buying food for a healthy diet cost 25% of disposable income for low-income households and 30% for those living at the poverty line, Zorbas said. \u201cIn rural or remote areas, it\u2019s higher than that,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some of the rural Aboriginal communities it\u2019s 40% to 50% of their incomes. \u201cNow that\u2019s gone up \u2013 it was already not accessible, it has just made matters worse.\u201d Kristin O\u2019Connell, a spokesperson from the Antipoverty Centre, said they were seeing an increase in people living below the poverty line skipping meals.

Because so many of the cheapest products are again disappearing from shelves like they did during lockdowns.\u201d While food subsidies were a possible solution, she said the best thing to help Australians living in poverty was to increase the amount of assistance they are offered. \u201cWe don\u2019t need some kind of new version of a voucher programme or a rationing scheme \u2013 we need money,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are lots of things that would reduce the cost of living in a meaningful way for people on low incomes, but in this situation, it\u2019s a crisis \u2026 the most straightforward and direct way to make sure that we can eat enough is to give us money.\u201d", "Did media coverage of Shane Warne\u2019s death step over the line? | The Weekly Beast [2022-03-11T01:59:04Z]": "When Shane Warne was found unresponsive in Koh Samui, Thailand a week ago his manager, James Erskine, issued a short statement confirming his untimely death at 52 and relaying his family\u2019s wish to be left alone to grieve. \u201cThe family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course,\u201d he said.

The Sunday Age deputy editor, Patrick O\u2019Neil, told Weekly Beast that Nine Entertainment was \u201cin discussions\u201d with Lehmann over a role. Lehmann did not respond to a request for comment. Google and Facebook\u2019s brown paper bag  On Thursday the ABC managing director, David Anderson, opened the ABC\u2019s first bureau in Charleville in south-west Queensland, one of 55 new positions which have been filled in every state and in the Northern Territory. The ABC has been able to expand its regional and rural coverage \u2013 bringing the number of journos outside the cities to 600 \u2013 thanks to the passage of the news media bargaining code 12 months ago.    After being a late entrant to the eligible media organisations, the ABC was able to negotiate with Facebook and Google for an undisclosed sum which the broadcaster promised would be spent on regional and rural public interest journalism. The Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, said the tech funds \u201cmade a huge, huge difference to our newsroom\u201d and enabled the site to double its podcasting desk and expand reportage outside the capital cities.News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment also signed deals with Facebook and Google but neither company has chosen to disclose what the funds have been spent on. The code was described this week by the Judith Neilson Institute (JNI) inaugural Alan Moorehead journalist-in-residence, Bill Grueskin, as an Australian success story \u201cto those who\u2019ve long yearned to force big tech to prop up suffering newsrooms,\u201d who also said it was \u201ca murky deal\u201d with unprecedented secrecy. Grueskin, who is a professor of professional practice at Columbia University\u2019s graduate school of journalism, spoke about his research into the code at JNI\u2019s Chippendale headquarters on Thursday, and how difficult it was to glean any details from the media companies which signed the deals with the tech giants. \u201cCritical details [were] guarded like they\u2019re nuclear launch codes,\u201d Grueskin said. He said he was surprised how tight-lipped everyone was about the nature of the deals, said to be worth a total of $200m. Grueskin\u2019s article about the code in the Columbia Journalism Review summed it up: \u201cIn the words of one Sydney media executive, \u2018It\u2019s like a brown paper bag gets stuffed with money, is shoved across the table, and then the platforms can say: Now just shut the fuck up.\u2019\u201d Devine\u2019s staycation Daily Telegraph columnist Miranda Devine, who joined the New York Post for an 18-month stint before the 2020 US election, has loved it so much she has decided to stay in the Big Apple. Devine has become a darling of the right in the US, making the gig work with appearances on Fox News, columns in Murdoch\u2019s Sydney and New York tabloids and a book about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, Laptop From Hell. \u201cIt is very exciting,\u201d Devine told CNN\u2019s Source Material. \u201cThere is never a dull minute at the New York Post,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve loved my time here and I look forward to lots more.\u201d Better late than never? The editors of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Bevan Shields and Gay Alcorn, have belatedly apologised to readers for incidents last month which brought the Nine newspapers considerable criticism. Weekly Beast reported two weeks ago that at least one staff member told Shields before 7am that the Sydney train outage was \u201cnot technically a strike\u201d and that \u201cindustrial action\u201d would be a better description. Shields insisted it was a strike. Internal messages revealing the exchange were later leaked. In a letter to subscribers on Friday Shields said it wasn\u2019t a conspiracy it was just a \u201cstuff-up\u201d: \u201cSome critics have tried to portray the use of the word \u2018strike\u2019 as some kind of conspiracy but this was simply a stuff-up, which was later corrected. Any assessment of our coverage over the following hours and days would detect no sign of anti-union bias.\u201d There was no explanation why it took more than 10 days between staff raising concerns and the readers\u2019 letter to correct a basic factual mistake. Alcorn addressed the removal of the story by Chip Le Grand that suggested multimillionaire Geoff Bainbridge was the victim of an elaborate six-year extortion racket. The Melbourne editor, who had already admitted the Age was \u201cbadly misled\u201d, told readers it was an \u201cembarrassing error\u201d and that she was sorry. \u201cThis was an embarrassing error, and we have inquired into how it happened and what our processes should be to prevent something like this happening again,\u201d Alcorn said.", "\u2018Horrific\u2019: decade-high number of women killed in December demands \u2018serious investment\u2019 in prevention [2022-12-23T14:00:06Z]": "A sharp rise in the number of women allegedly killed by men has prompted calls for greater investment in family and domestic violence prevention ahead of the dangerous Christmas period. At least 10 women have been killed this month in Australia, more than three times the average rate of one woman per week. The chief executive of Safe and Equal, Tania Farha, said the increase was \u201creally alarming\u201d coming into summer \u2013 typically the busiest time of year for domestic violence services and police responders. The latest deaths come after a relative decline in homicides. There were 61 women killed by family and domestic violence related homicide in 2021 \u2013 the latest official reporting period \u2013 a decrease of 28% from the previous year.   Related: The money trap: Australian women drag banks to the fight against relentless financial abuse    \u201cIt\u2019s the highest number for this period in the past 10 years, and a horrific average,\u201d Farha said. \u201cYear after year we see abuse ramp up in December. It\u2019s a time of relaxation and happiness for many but such a high-risk time for people experiencing family violence. \u201cThere\u2019s heightened tensions around holidays, people are together more often and people reach crisis point. But it\u2019s always a choice, driven by gender inequality and power imbalance.\u201d Two-thirds of family violence assaults in Victoria last year occurred between Christmas and new year \u2013 the rate of an incident every five minutes. A Victoria police spokesperson said it had observed a consistent spike in family violence callouts during the end of the year, with \u201cclear increases\u201d on Christmas Day and New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cPerpetrators are skilled at showing respectability or normalising conflict, and victims are kept silent by shame and fear,\u201d they said. \u201cBut sometimes our closest family and friends will get to see and hear some of what is \u2026 really happening behind that veneer of the normal ups and downs of a relationship. If something doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t ignore it.\u201d In Queensland, the highest days of demand for police responders to domestic and family violence last year were Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day, with 270 and 254 incidents respectively. It\u2019s a similar picture in New South Wales, where domestic violence incidents consistently spike over summer. There were 8,796 offences in the most recent summer period and 3,109 in December alone, compared with 7,376 throughout winter. At the same time, domestic violence-related assault offences have increased annually in NSW by an average of 3.1% in the five years to September 2022. Journalist Sherele Moody, the founder of the Australian Femicide Watch and the Red Heart Campaign, a memorial to women and children lost to violence, has been documenting the violent deaths of women since 2015. She said the recent spate of killings was the highest she\u2019d seen in such a short period.  \u201cClearly something isn\u2019t going right, and policies aren\u2019t working,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are being killed. What are we doing wrong? Why are we not getting these rates down? The answer to ending violence is with men. \u201cGendered violence is the key problem here \u2013 it\u2019s up to men to fix it.\u201d Moody\u2019s database has registered 55 deaths of women and children this year, including 11 in the past three weeks. All but one of the recent deaths were allegedly perpetrated by a male. \u201cI want us to get to Christmas without any more women being killed. For those families, it\u2019s their first Christmas without their loved ones.\u201d Moody said while there was a clear peak in violence around the end of the year, the festive season was also be a time when women tried to maintain the facade of a happy household. \u201cIt\u2019s never isolated to stress during Christmas but part of a continuum of abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a year-long issue.\u201d Dr Leesa Hooker, a lead researcher into reducing violence against women at La Trobe rural health school, said it was widely accepted domestic violence increased during public holidays. But its causes were complex. \u201cWhile gender inequality is at the heart of it all, we have reinforcing factors and harmful social norms that increase over holiday periods \u2013 alcohol and drug use and social stressors,\u201d she said. \u201cIt all accumulates to cause more violence by men \u2026 Christmas is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\u201d Hooker said the chronic underreporting of family and domestic violence was another problem. The rate of incidents is commonly accepted to be higher than official figures. \u201cThe true prevalence of domestic violence we\u2019re not clear on, until the data improves we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d Hooker said. Hooker hoped improved datasets would be partially achieved through the federal government\u2019s ambitious National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children. \u201cWe need serious investment in primary prevention and how to monitor that effort over a long period of time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so complex, you can\u2019t have one dataset. We need better ways of collecting hospital data, police data, personal safety. \u201cIt requires significant investment to make generational change, that\u2019s the only way we can stop this epidemic of violence towards women. I can\u2019t see it yet.\u201d   Related: Australian courts to consider family and domestic violence threat in Hague convention cases     A spokesperson for 1800RESPECT said the end of year holiday season could be a \u201ccritical and challenging time\u201d and was a particularly busy period for its domestic, family and sexual violence services. \u201cFor many people, the holiday season initiates family gatherings which can trigger a lot of anxiety and stress and we encourage anyone affected or at risk of violence to contact the service,\u201d they said.

Gastroenteritis, or gastro, involves inflammation of the stomach and intestinal lining, and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhoea. It\u2019s mostly spread by symptomatic people when virus from their faeces or vomit hitches a ride on their hands, objects, food or drinks. But people can pass it on before symptoms develop or without suffering symptoms themselves. There are many causes \u2013 including viruses, bacteria and parasites \u2013 but the most prevalent are rotavirus in children and norovirus in adults. While most people recover in a few days, the illness can be more serious for infants, elderly people and those who are immunocompromised. So how can you best protect yourself and others? And if you or someone in your household has contracted gastro, what is the best way to treat the illness? Immunise children against rotavirus    For children, immunisation against rotavirus \u2013 which is free under the National Immunisation Program Schedule \u2013 is the best way to protect children from severe illness. Dr George Alex, the director of gastroenterology at the Royal Children\u2019s hospital in Melbourne, says: \u201cIn Australia it\u2019s part of the immunisation protocol at two and four months of age \u2013 the first dose must be given by 14 weeks and the second dose by 24 weeks of age.\u201d But vaccinated children can still fall prey to gastro, whether from rotavirus or other causes. \u201cThat\u2019s because neither natural infection with rotavirus nor vaccination provides full protection from future infections, but [vaccination] decreases the severity of the disease significantly,\u201d Alex says. Drink plenty of fluids, try to eat and avoid flat lemonade    \u201cIn most cases [of gastro], the body will fight off the infection and recover on its own. The mainstay of treatment is to ensure plenty of fluids are drunk to prevent dehydration,\u201d says Dr Santosh Sanagapalli, a gastroenterologist at St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Sydney. \u201cFor older children and adults, plenty of liquid should be drunk \u2013 ideally commercially prepared oral rehydration solutions, available from the chemist. \u201cIn breastfed infants, short and frequent breastfeeding should continue but sometimes supplemental fluids are required.\u201d Children who don\u2019t tolerate rehydration solutions can be given juice diluted with water. But ignore advice to drink flat lemonade, as experts warn sugary drinks can exacerbate diarrhoea. If you\u2019re nauseous, small amounts of food are recommended and start with bland food such as toast, crackers or rice when your appetite returns. That holds for children too, says Dr Nikhil Thapar, the director of gastroenterology at the Queensland Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cIn the old days, the mantra was kind of \u2018starve the bugs\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then of course, we realised a lot of these kids took longer to recover. So in most cases of mild, even moderate gastroenteritis, it\u2019s often that continuing to provide them with nutrition and ensuring they have a good amount of fluid \u2026 are really important for the recovery.\u201d Prescribed medication might help Dr Michael Clements, a Townsville-based GP and chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners\u2019 rural arm, says doctors can prescribe medication to help with nausea and \u201cif vomiting is a major issue\u201d. \u201cIn terms of vomiting, we used to talk about letting nature run its course but now we\u2019re a lot more comfortable in using a particular drug called ondansetron, which you need a prescription for, and is safe in children and adults,\u201d he says.   Related: Considering Feb Fast? Here are three immediate and long-term benefits of giving up alcohol    Clements says the drug, which comes as a wafer that dissolves in the mouth, may be helpful for those who can\u2019t keep medicines down. But he emphasises that anyone on important medications should seek medical advice early in their illness. \u201cYou might not absorb some of your medications while you\u2019ve got nausea and diarrhoea, so they may not be as effective \u2013 that includes painkillers as well as contraceptive pills,\u201d Clements says. If telehealth isn\u2019t appropriate, general practices have policies around seeing infectious patients face-to-face, which might include waiting in the car until being assessed. The Gastroenterological Society of Australia advises against giving over-the-counter medicines to reduce vomiting and diarrhoea to children as they may stop the gut functioning naturally. Wash your hands with soap (not sanitiser) and stay at home    Face masks won\u2019t offer much protection against gastro. Alex says the illness is spread by ingestion rather than inhalation and unless a patient is \u201cvomiting profusely\u201d, in general, mask wearing may not be helpful. Clements recommends giving any afflicted household members their own bathroom, towels and sink, if possible, and keeping them away from food preparation or dining areas. He also emphasises the importance of washing hands thoroughly with soap and water, since alcohol-based hand sanitisers aren\u2019t effective at killing the viruses that cause gastro. \u201cWhen these things are going around, one of the best things we can do is just to keep people home \u2013 don\u2019t send kids to daycare or school or go work,\u201d Clements says. It\u2019s recommended that you wait 24 to 48 hours after symptoms pass before resuming normal activities. When to seek medical advice    Dehydration is a risk for anyone with gastro, though older people are more susceptible \u2013 particularly if they have other risk factors such as poor kidney function or take certain medications. Signs of dehydration include being dizzy or lightheaded, headache, dark urine and dry mouth. People who can\u2019t keep any fluids down are advised to see a doctor, as they may need an intravenous drip. Other signs you should see a doctor include: blood or mucus in bowel movements, green vomit, high fever, severe abdominal pain or symptoms persisting beyond seven days. \u201cIf there is blood or mucus in the stool, the cause is more likely to be bacterial. Severe abdominal pain may also point more towards a bacterial cause,\u201d Sanagapalli says. Antibiotics are prescribed for some severe cases of bacterial gastroenteritis. Anyone recently returned from overseas, along with babies under six months old, should also be checked by a doctor if they have vomiting and diarrhoea. Children and babies are also more susceptible to dehydration. \u201cIf they\u2019re not drinking and just vomiting, they\u2019re not passing much urine, not getting wet nappies, if they start to get drowsy, if when they cry they have no tears \u2013 that might prompt [seeing a doctor],\u201d Thapar says.   Related: Itchy, sneezy and wheezy? How Australians can get a handle on hay fever season    \u201cIf children have quite significant [pre-existing] illnesses or are on immunosuppression treatments, most specialist units would have given them emergency treatment plans, but often just touching base with healthcare providers is useful if you\u2019re concerned.\u201d Are there long-term effects of gastro? Sanagapalli says while rare, a small number of gastro patients develop post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, where milder gut symptoms linger for weeks or even years. \u201cIf this occurs, see your GP or gastroenterologist, as you may need further evaluation or specific therapy,\u201d he says. But all four experts agree there isn\u2019t enough evidence to support taking probiotics during or after a case of gastro. The exception is diarrhoea caused by antibiotics, Thapar says. \u201cCertainly for things like antibiotic-induced diarrhoea, then there is evidence around the use of probiotics to try and limit that. That\u2019s really when the antibiotics have killed off a lot of your own bugs and having a probiotic helps to repopulate the gut.\u201d", "Fears Lismore art gallery\u2019s entire collection lost in NSW floods [2022-03-02T05:42:03Z]": "There are fears the entire collection at the Lismore Regional Gallery may have been lost during the catastrophic floods in northern New South Wales. \nThe gallery director, Ashleigh Ralph, said that while no one had been able to get access to the building to confirm the situation, flood waters had risen 2.5 metres higher than expected, which meant the top floor of the gallery had been inundated. \n\u201cThe collection we stored up there, it\u2019s got all our major exhibitions on the second floor in case of flooding.

Just past the halfway stage of the election campaign, multiple newspapers have released polls pointing to a slight advantage for Anthony Albanese\u2019s Labor opposition over the conservative Coalition comprising the Liberal party under Morrison and the rural-based National party. However, the polls failed to predict Morrison\u2019s narrow win in 2019, and support for both major parties is in decline, leaving several outcomes open, including the prospect of a hung parliament. Morrison\u2019s task is to retain the 76 seats the Coalition currently holds \u2013 the minimum required to form government in a parliament of 151 \u2013 which would extend Labor\u2019s run of losing elections to four, stretching back to 2013. He has hopes of picking up some Labor marginals, particularly in New South Wales, but also faces threats from a well organised group of independents in generally wealthy inner-city seats who are demanding more urgent action on climate. So far, the campaign has been rocky for both leaders.   Related: Undecided? Jaded with Australia\u2019s major parties? Here are five stark differences between them this election | Paul Daley    The campaign began shortly after revelations that members of Morrison\u2019s government, including the deputy prime minister and National party leader, Barnaby Joyce, had called him a liar, both publicly and privately. Morrison has since endured sustained criticism from Labor over Australia\u2019s disintegrating relationship with the Solomon Islands after the Pacific nation signed a security pact with Beijing that blindsided the Australian government. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate for the first time since 2010, prompting the country\u2019s four largest banks to immediately raise their interest rates, after alarming figures released the previous week showed inflation rising at double the pace of wages. Having campaigned for weeks on cost-of-living issues, hoping to reinforce the traditional strength of the Coalition on economic management, Morrison was quick to dissociate the bank\u2019s decision from his policies, blaming overseas events beyond his control. Labor seized on the rate rise, as it unveiled a policy to help lower income Australians break into the investor-driven housing market, whereby the government would take a 40% stake in a house to ease mortgage sizes.    Albanese, coming out of a week of Covid isolation at his home in Sydney, travelled to Western Australia to officially launch his party\u2019s campaign, and later to Queensland, in a week where he was joined by the premiers of Labor-led states whose popularity surged as a result of tight domestic border controls during the pandemic. Albanese, who has made much of his upbringing as the child of a single mother in Sydney public housing, is a party stalwart from Labor\u2019s left faction, although far from a radical firebrand. A near-fatal car crash near his home last year made him refocus his life, he says, and he has since made a point of his healthier diet and lifestyle, while acceding to superficial image changes. But he has struggled to inject inspiration into Labor\u2019s campaign, which has kept its policy offering to a minimum after the ambitious program of his predecessor, Bill Shorten, was effectively torn down by Morrison at the 2019 election. But the Coalition is fighting on more than one front, thanks to the so-called \u201cteal independents\u201d \u2013 candidates running in traditionally safe Liberal party seats on a strong climate action platform, some backed by substantial funds from the Climate 200 organisation.Many have adopted the colours pioneered by former winter Olympian Zali Steggall, who ousted the former prime minister Tony Abbott from his Sydney seat of Warringah at the last election, the teal nodding both to the traditional Liberal blue and their green credentials. Several seats in affluent areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Perth appear vulnerable to independents, according to polling, threatening the political career of prominent moderate Liberal MPs, including the Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in the traditionally rock-solid Liberal seat of Kooyong, in Melbourne.   Related: \u2018Vote for us because we are not Labor\u2019 is the most unfulfilling call to action in recent memory | Katharine Murphy    Rather than shift policy to appeal to moderate Liberals concerned about climate, Morrison has focused on voters in outer metropolitan, regional and mining seats, some former Labor strongholds, others held by the Nationals.  Morrison went on the attack this week, criticising the other pillar of the teal independent platform \u2013 calls for a robust federal anti-corruption watchdog \u2013 as potentially leading to a \u201cpublic autocracy\u201d. Morrison has also resisted calls to disendorse Katherine Deves, the candidate he hand-picked to challenge the independent Steggall. Deves has been revealed to have made controversial comments about transgender women playing sport, using Holocaust comparisons to make her point. Morrison\u2019s stance again seems likely to further alienate voters in some of the seats being challenged by independents.  Morrison has warned voters that electing these candidates could result in a hung parliament, and that a future minority government would be hampered in its ability to pass legislation without ceding to the independents\u2019 demands. On Friday, the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was ousted as Liberal leader in 2018 and ultimately replaced by Morrison, said voting for the teal independents could thwart the \u201ccapture\u201d of the Liberal party by its conservative wing. Elsewhere, leaders have stumbled over seemingly more straightforward blocks. Albanese was unable to name the unemployment and interest rates on the first day of the campaign, and then struggled to explain Labor\u2019s disability policy when pressed by journalists. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, won some kudos for telling a journalist who asked what the obscure wage price index was, to \u201cGoogle it, mate\u201d. Most bizarre of all was Morrison, who posted an image to his Facebook page on Sunday night of curries he had prepared for his family \u2013 a well-worn tactic he has used to promote his brand as a regular suburban dad spending time with his family. \u201cStrong curry. Strong economy. Stronger future,\u201d the caption read. The image showed an extremely pale looking chicken korma, with an alarmingly pinkish chunk of meat, triggering an onslaught of negative comments. Morrison defending his cooking skills, telling one radio station the photograph was misleading: \u201cPeople went back for seconds. It was just the way the light bounced off the skin of the chicken.\u201d", "Australian economy holds firm in June quarter driven by export boom [2022-09-07T01:45:15Z]": "Australia\u2019s economy held firm in the June quarter as a yawning trade surplus propelled growth even as companies began to cut back on demand and householders drew on savings to keep spending. National accounts data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed gross domestic product expanded 0.9% for the quarter and 3.6% compared with a year earlier.   Interactive Quarterly growth at 0.9% for the April-June period met economists\u2019 expectations.   Economists had predicted about 1% quarterly pace and about 3.5% annual growth. In the March quarter, GDP expanded 0.8% and 3.3% on a quarterly and yearly basis, respectively.   Related: Economists predict slowdown for Australian economy as interest rates continue to rise    The main contributors in the April-June were net exports, which added 1.1 percentage points to GDP growth while household spending held up, contributing 1.1 percentage points. But a drop in the inventories held by firms lopped 1.2 percentage points off the growth. \u201cToday\u2019s national accounts reflect an economy which is rebounding from the disruptions of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still being held back by capacity constraints, skills shortages and declining real wages,\u201d Treasurer Jim Chalmers told a media conference. \u201cThis is an economy which is growing, but the challenges are growing as well.\u201d The GDP figures offered a snapshot of the strength on the economy inherited by the Albanese government.

China\u2019s economy, easily Australia\u2019s biggest export market, has continued to falter amid Covid clampdowns, and most other trading partners are facing their own higher interest rates and slowing growth. Key to shoring up growth in the June quarter were households willing to cut savings to keep up with rising costs of everything from petrol to food. The saving to income ratio fell for a third consecutive quarter, from 11.1% to 8.7%, as the increase in household spending outpaced growth in household income, the ABS said.

That annual rate was the fastest since 1988-89 \u201cand was broad-based across the domestic economy and international trade\u201d, the ABS said. The rising commodity prices, driven in part by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine sending global energy prices soaring, boosted Australia\u2019s export prices 8.8% in the quarter, well ahead of the 3.9% increase in import prices. \u201cExports recorded the strongest quarterly rise since the Sydney Olympics boosted travel exports in September quarter 2000,\u201d Crick said. Goods exports rose 4.2%, with the main contributors being mineral ores, other mineral fuels and rural goods. Services exports rose 13.7%, driven by travel and transportation services, as international borders were open for the full quarter.   Interactive   Unions, meanwhile, have highlighted that workers\u2019 share of GDP in terms of wages were at a record low 44.1% while profits rose to a record high.

A former chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Producers &amp; Exporters Association (APPEA), McConville was appointed to the top job at the MDBA by the Morrison government just days before the federal election was called. He is not due to start until June but recently posted a letter introducing himself to staff and explaining his approach to the job. \u201cI am absolutely thrilled and delighted to have been appointed the chief executive,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a real passion for Australian agriculture and for regional and rural Australia.   Related: NSW government\u2019s issuing of flood plain harvesting licences \u2018an act of bastardry\u2019, crossbenchers say    \u201cThis is not an appointment or responsibility I take lightly. The work that you do is important and in the national interest.\u201d The email made no mention of the environmental challenges facing the Murray-Darling Basin, climate change or other stakeholders such as First Nations people, who have been advocating for rights to cultural flows. The omission has worried many MDBA staff \u2013 particularly those who work on the environmental side of the organisation. McConville told staff he grew up in Armidale, got an agricultural economics degree at the University of New England and has a master\u2019s of science from Oxford, \u201cwhere I probably played too much rugby but managed to pass the time\u201d. He said that he spent much of his career in agriculture, focused on building productivity and resilient communities and enterprises \u201cthrough collaboration with strong relationships, a commitment to sustainability and the sensible use of technology\u201d. McConville said he \u201chad at least a little bit of water in my veins\u201d as he was one of the architects of Victoria\u2019s water trading scheme in the 1990s. He also mentioned his experience at the Australian Wheat Board and at Syngenta \u2013 a large agricultural chemicals and seed business \u2013 as well as his time at APPEA. \u201cWater management is a complex and contested space with many stakeholders often with competing views,\u201d he said. \u201cManaging stakeholders is something I am passionate about. I have had some tough ones over the years: opponents and proponents of single desk marketing [of wheat] \u2026 pesticides and GMOs against organics, and fossil fuels in a net zero world. So how hard can it be, right!?\u201d McConville acknowledged he had a lot to learn and said he wanted staff to share their advice and deep knowledge of the critical river system. A number of staff have raised their concerns about the letter and McConville\u2019s emphasis on agricultural outcomes internally \u2013 as well as with Guardian Australia.   Related: Government paying \u2018eight times\u2019 over market price for Murray-Darling water buyback, environment groups claim    The MDBA was established under the Water Act 2007 to address historic overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling Basin to agriculture and restore the environmental health of the river. It is now in the final stages of implementing the $13bn plan which is still well short of returning 2,750 gigalitres of water \u2013 the amount that states and the commonwealth agreed was the minimum required to ensure a sustainable river system. This figure is seen as inadequate by most environmental scientists. The Act says the MDBA is \u201cto promote the use and management of the basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes\u201d and \u201cto ensure the return to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction for water resources that are over-allocated or overused\u201d. It is also charged with ensuring Australia meets its international obligations to protect several wetlands under the Ramsar treaty arrangements. In undertaking its task it must use the best available science to guide its decision making. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who has taken a deep interest in the Murray-Darling Basin plan, said McConville\u2019s first letter to staff had confirmed fears about the appointment. \u201cPutting an oil and gas lobbyist, from Queensland, in charge of Australia\u2019s most important river system is obscene,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cThis email introducing himself to the authority\u2019s staff exposes the worst fears of downstream communities and those who care deeply about the health of the river.  \u201cIn a rambling, two-page, self-congratulatory memo to staff, not once did Mr McConville even mention the environment. The whole point of the MDBA is to keep the river alive and flowing, yet the new boss displays total ignorance to the needs of the environment and water security impacts of the climate crisis. \u201cThe tone-deaf memo is a warning sign of more pain for river. With the Murray-Darling Basin plan failing to deliver the promised and needed environmental flows to South Australia, it is alarming that the guy in charge seems more interested in appeasing corporate irrigators than looking after the environment.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning       Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Asked about the memo, McConville said there has been a great deal of interest in his appointment, which was understandable since he had come from outside government and the water, environment and agriculture sectors. \u201cFirst and foremost my job will always be to run an independent, statutory agency to deliver its remit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis also means listening, understanding and working collaboratively with a range of people. In doing that the goal must absolutely be a healthy and sustainable river system because we all benefit from this, it is what all Australians need and expect.\u201d McConville confirmed he knew the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, from university days. Both attended UNE. \u201cWe played rugby against each other at opposing colleges some 30 years ago,\u201d McConville said. \u201cSince his entering politics, I have engaged with Barnaby occasionally, as I would and do with a wide range of MPs across the political spectrum. \u201cMy relationship is not personal and is no different to any political connection I have on all sides of politics.\u201d In Senate estimates in April, the secretary of the agriculture, water and environment department, Andrew Metcalfe, said McConville was one of three candidates whose names were ultimately sent to the minister for a decision, which was then ratified by cabinet. A total of 19 applications were received and a further five were identified by headhunters. McConville was one of the applicants for the $443,000 a year job. \u201cThe panel was very satisfied as to all three candidates,\u201d Metcalfe told estimates. \u201cMr McConville is certainly someone that we regarded as being a very outstanding candidate.\u201d", "\u2018I am who I am\u2019: how a blind Kurdish refugee became an Australian sporting superstar [2022-11-16T14:00:24Z]": "Nothing has ever come easily for Amir Abdi. At every turn there have been obstacles standing in his way. Growing up in rural Iran, Abdi was blinded by a botched medical operation. He overcame stigma and discrimination \u2013 as a consequence of both his disability and Kurdish heritage \u2013 to become one of Iran\u2019s best blind athletes. But when Abdi was forced to leave his homeland for safe haven in Australia, the hardships only continued: immigration detention, temporary visas, rejected applications.     Amir Abdi leaves his house to attend football training as his partner looks on.  Through it all, 33-year-old Abdi has retained his infectious enthusiasm and buoyant smile. He has never taken \u201cno\u201d for an answer \u2013 there is always a way. In the face overwhelming adversity, Abdi has retained his hope and his humanity. Against all odds, he has succeeded. This week, in sweltering Kochi, India, Abdi is captaining Australia\u2019s blind football team in their international competitive debut. That alone is a remarkable achievement \u2013 but it\u2019s barely the half of it. Representing his adopted nation on the global stage is the culmination of an extraordinary three-decade journey. It is a tale of hardship, a tale of determination. *** Abdi was born into a farming family, in a small Kurdish village in the meandering Zagros Mountains in western Iran. \u201cWe had a beautiful \u2013 and hard \u2013 childhood,\u201d he says. Not long after turning 12, Abdi was taken to hospital. His memory of the time is hazy \u2013 he recalls experiencing bad headaches. Abdi was subject to experimental surgery, which went horribly wrong, and he lost vision in both eyes.      Abdi and his coach David Connolly prepare for a training session in Melbourne.  Blindness was a cruel blow. \u201cThere was no purpose to living any more,\u201d Abdi recalls thinking at the time. \u201cAll my dreams were gone.\u201d The stigma around disability in Iran was acute; it was only after becoming blind that Abdi learned he had a neighbour with an intellectual disability, who was kept inside at all times by their family. Abdi\u2019s family was different; their belief in him unshakeable. After Abdi had recovered, his uncle \u2013 living in the capital, Tehran \u2013 decided to explore options for his nephew\u2019s schooling. \u201cHe changed the world for me,\u201d Abdi says. The uncle identified a specialised school for blind children in Tehran, and Abdi was set to relocate. But ever since that botched operation, nothing in life has been simple for Abdi. Discrimination against the Kurdish minority is rife in Iran, and the school principal refused to let him stay. \u201cAnything with me is political,\u201d Abdi says. Instead, he was transferred to a school in Isfahan.     Above: The approved sound balls for use in five-a-side blind football have devices strategically placed in order to generate a loud consistent sound and balanced roll. Below: Abdi training with members of the Australian blind football team.     Abdi spent the best part of a decade in the historic city. \u201cI had a hard time and a good time,\u201d he says. Abdi was the only Kurdish student and struggled to maintain his cultural traditions. But he finished his education and fell in love with sport. It was pure coincidence. One day, Abdi had not done his homework. By way of punishment, he was told to run laps of the school. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a cane [to use as a navigational aid],\u201d he says. \u201cSo I had to find a way \u2013 I had to mind-map my way around the school, and start running.\u201d A teacher watching on immediately spotted Abdi\u2019s potential. He was soon learning how to play goalball, an indoor team sport for people with visual impairment. A budding sporting career would not come easily. Abdi\u2019s family were poor \u2013 they lacked the money to pay for specialised equipment. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the luxury to buy sports shoes, sports socks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was hard at the start \u2013 I was struggling.\u201d But such was Abdi\u2019s raw potential that the local goalball team agreed to cover his expenses, signing him to a professional contract. They even agreed to pay for travel back to his village from time to time. \u201cThat was such a luxury,\u201d he says.     Trophies from goalball and community services work awarded to Abdi.  On the pitch, Abdi found freedom. \u201cIt was empowering,\u201d he says. Goalball gave him a platform. \u201cI was thinking \u2013 how can I get on a stage to help my parents, and other parents, to understand that it\u2019s OK to have a child with disability. It\u2019s not the end of the world \u2013 it\u2019s just different.\u201d Within the team he found acceptance. \u201cI had a space to raise my voice and to show my skill.\u201d Abdi\u2019s ascent was meteoric \u2013 he was soon part of the national team. Yet discrimination again stood in his way. \u201cI was excluded,\u201d he says. \u201cI trained so hard, I did all I could \u2013 but they didn\u2019t open the door for me.\u201d Abdi was the first Kurdish player in the national team; there has not been another one since. The pain lingers in his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t find the right word to describe it, there\u2019s just a silence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful. You tick all the boxes but you you\u2019re still not included.\u201d    Abdi continued to play professionally and became politically active, advocating for disability rights. He soon ran into trouble; political opposition is limited in Iran and the country is ranked \u201cnot free\u201d by Freedom House. Abdi declines to speak in any detail about these difficulties \u2013 his parents remain in his home village today. \u201cIt was time to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I moved \u2013 I became a refugee and came to Australia.\u201d With his brother, Abdi left Iran. Eventually he made it to Australia, arriving by boat in 2013. He spent a couple of years in immigration detention \u2013 in Christmas Island, Darwin and then in Melbourne. \u201cIt was a difficult time,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t speak the language, I wasn\u2019t able to access a cane. But once again, sport came to save me.\u201d Even in detention, Abdi wanted to play goalball. Eventually, he was able to secure a conditional release to train once a week. \u201cI remember the first time, there were five or six security guards around me, and an interpreter,\u201d he laughs. His connection to the blind sports community soon flourished. By late 2014, Abdi was released from detention on a temporary visa.     Above: Doors are closed in an effort to minimise ambient noise so competitors can hear the ball; silence is mandatory in the sport of goalball. Below: Abdi has a shot on goal during the Australian Goalball Championship held at Melbourne University in September.     *** It\u2019s late September, and Abdi is competing in the national goalball championships in Melbourne. He had pulled together a team to represent South Australia, as the Victorian team had already been named. Abdi\u2019s teammates had never played together, but in the opening match \u2013 against Victoria \u2013 there is no lack of cohesion on show. The South Australians are soon leading, and Abdi shows off his reflexes to deny Victoria\u2019s penalty attempt. Goalball is played on an area slightly smaller than a basketball court, with two elongated goals \u2013 wider but shorter than a football goal \u2013 at either end. Each team has three active players at a time, spread across the court protecting the goalmouth. The teams take turns hurling the ball towards the goal, hoping to elude opposition players who make diving saves. (Australia\u2019s women goalballers made the quarter-finals at the Tokyo Paralympics).     In an effort to make sure everyone is competing equally, all competitors must have their eyes covered fully when playing goalball.  Abdi\u2019s fiancee, Kore Brand, is standing on the sidelines. \u201cIt\u2019s so mean I\u2019m not allowed to clap,\u201d she says, as Abdi saves another penalty. The ball contains a bell to help players track its movement, which means the crowd must be silent during play. But when a goal is scored, spectators erupt. This is particularly true when Abdi is substituted and takes to cheering on boisterously from the bench, as his team see out a comfortable opening win. Abdi is a cut above \u2013 a star on the court. He is also a natural leader, urging on his colleagues in subsequent games as the team slide to losses against New South Wales and Queensland. \u201cThis is going to be a goal,\u201d he declares defiantly while winding up to take a shot, trailing in the second half against Queensland. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t, Amir,\u201d hits back a snarky opponent as the attempt goes wide. But even the defeats cannot wipe the smile from Abdi\u2019s face. It is the first major competition since he secured Australian citizenship, and the first time Brand has watched him compete at this level. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased and proud,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite emotional for me.\u201d     Abdi and his partner Kore Brand.  *** Neither citizenship nor his relationship came easily. When Abdi first joined the goalball national team, he was unable to travel with the squad due to his visa status \u2013 consigned to permanent temporariness because he arrived by boat. On a couple of occasions Abdi was able to compete at friendly tournaments, in Japan and Thailand. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t compete in formal competitions,\u201d he says. In 2018, Abdi and those around him identified a possible pathway: a distinguished talent visa. These are issued to those with a \u201cinternationally recognised record of exceptional and outstanding achievement\u201d in fields including sport, research and the arts. With the help of Blind Sport Australia, the peak body, Abdi applied. At first, he got nowhere \u2013 the Department of Home Affairs rejected his application on medical grounds. In effect, he was denied because he was blind, the very thing that makes him distinguished as a blind athlete. Abdi laughs with hindsight. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fact I had a disability \u2013 I couldn\u2019t pass the medical thing.\u201d Blind Sport Australia appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In a decision in 2020, tribunal member Amanda Mendes Da Costa found that Abdi\u2019s \u201csporting achievements, numerous voluntary activities, studies and employment history demonstrate that he would be an asset to the Australian community.\u201d On a technicality, Mendes Da Costa held that she was unable to overrule the decision. But she referred the case to the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for reconsideration.    It was at this point Abdi found a champion within Parliament House. Senator Kristina Keneally, Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister at the time, had been in the headlines helping secure citizenship for Wallabies star Quade Cooper. One day in 2020, a member of Keneally\u2019s staff received a phone call from Abdi. \u201cI\u2019m the Quade Cooper of blind football!\u201d he said. It was a stroke of luck after a long, draining journey through Australian\u2019s cruel immigration system. \u201cThe biggest struggle was finding the right person to advocate to,\u201d recalls Matthew Clayton, Blind Sport Australia\u2019s chief executive. Keneally and her team picked up the baton, working with minister Hawke to find a way through. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Keneally pleads with Hawke, arguing that granting the visa was clearly in the national interest. \u201cHis absence from key fixtures played a significant role in Australia\u2019s failure to qualify for Tokyo 2020 in either event, and the future success of Australia\u2019s goalball and blind soccer programs relies heavily on his ongoing and unrestricted participation,\u201d it reads. Abdi\u2019s circumstances were, the letter continues, \u201cunique and exceptional.\u201d     Abdi celebrates with South Australian teammates after winning their goalball clash with New South Wales.  It worked. In February this year, Abdi was issued a distinguished talent visa. A few months later he was granted Australian citizenship. \u201cIt was a long, long journey,\u201d Abdi recalls. \u201cIt was so beautiful, to finally be accepted, to be someone. It was a good feeling.\u201d Abdi was in the office when he first heard the news; he works as a social procurement administrator on major construction projects for John Holland (he is also a member of Victoria\u2019s Disability Advisory Council). \u201cI was speechless,\u201d he says. \u201cMentally I was exhausted, I couldn\u2019t go any further. I was just tired, over 20 years of integrating and going through so many barriers in my life, and suddenly coming to a place where I can actually say, \u2018I am who I am\u2019.\u201d It was a moment of relief. Abdi stresses that it was a \u201cteam effort \u2013 team Amir\u201d throughout the journey and acknowledges over a dozen friends who supported him during the visa process. But he also recognises an element of unfairness \u2013 thousands of other refugees who arrived by boat remain in limbo (the new Labor government has promised to find a solution). \u201cI feel there should be a way for these people to get out of the uncertainty,\u201d Abdi says. \u201cThere should be a fair system, giving people a fair chance.\u201d The news was also a joyous moment for Brand. \u201cShe was screaming down the phone,\u201d Abdi laughs. The couple\u2019s relationship is almost as extraordinary as Abdi\u2019s sporting journey. Brand, who is German, was in Australia working as a trainee priest when Abdi visited her church as part of a tour. There was an instant connection. But Brand returned to Germany and started training as a doctor, before the pandemic hit. With Abdi unable to travel due to his visa situation and Brand barred from entering Australia, the couple resorted to long-distance. Abdi rose at 5am every day to speak with Brand; she learned braille and sent letters. The pair will marry next year. *** Goalball may have been Abdi\u2019s first sporting love, and he remains one of the best players in Australia. Yet since settling in Melbourne, he has thrown himself into developing another sport \u2013 blind football. The sport is played between two teams of four outfield players, who are blind, and a goalkeeper, who is typically sighted. Each team also has a spotter behind the opposition goal, yelling out guidance. The rules are similar to futsal, although there is much more physical contact \u2013 it\u2019s a rough and tumble game.     Above: Amir Abdi stretches during his warm down. Below: The South Australian goalball team go outside after winning their opening match.     Abdi is arguably Australia\u2019s best blind footballer. \u201cHe leads both in terms of his talent and skill, but also as a leader,\u201d says Clayton. The sport only began to be played regularly in Australia in 2014 \u2013 Abdi has been among its pioneers. The national team, nicknamed the Bilbies, have played in a few international friendlies, but the regional championships are their first official competition. Blind football receives very limited government funding and is not part of Football Australia. The players are paying their own way to India (Clayton puts the cost at $7,000 or $8,000 each), and seeking donations. Since the sport\u2019s addition to the Paralympics in 2004, Australia has never qualified. By participating at this week\u2019s tournament, Abdi and his team have secured a spot at the world championships in England next year. If they perform well, the Bilbies will qualify for the 2024 Paralympics. \u201cWe\u2019d be making history,\u201d Abdi says. Clayton is optimistic the team will qualify \u2013 sooner or later. \u201cThere\u2019s a real chance to get there,\u201d he says. \u201cLos Angeles [in 2028] is probably a stronger chance. And then 2032 in Brisbane, we\u2019re fortunate to get an automatic position. Knowing Amir, he\u2019ll still want to be running around in his 40s. If anyone is going to do it, it will certainly be him.\u201d    But last week, the team\u2019s road to Paris was almost upended. When the squad arrived at Melbourne airport, their goalkeeper was denied boarding due to a last-minute visa issue. Without him, the team was in deep trouble. It was yet another setback on a journey characterised by constant adversity for Abdi. But as ever, he remained hopeful. Abdi was certain he could find a way. One phone call led to another and soon representations were being made at a high level to expedite a new visa, which was received on Friday morning.

Individually and collectively, the Bilbies had overcome great adversity to reach this point; even an 8-0 loss to heavyweights of the blind sport world would not dent their pride. \u201cThe team were committed and determined the whole game,\u201d says coach Dave Connolly. \u201cThey showed great spirit.\u201d    But late in the second half, Abdi collided with a teammate and suffered a broken nose. He is expected to miss the remainder of the tournament \u2013 although will remain in Kochi to lead the team off the pitch and cheer them on from the sidelines. \u201cVery unlucky,\u201d he says. It was yet another cruel blow. But it is just another obstacle standing in Abdi\u2019s way, another obstacle for him to overcome. Nothing has ever come easily for Amir Abdi. And yet he has always found a way. Whether in Paris or beyond, Abdi seems destined for Paralympic glory \u2013 and much more besides.", "\u2018Very vulnerable\u2019: first Covid outbreak in Norfolk Island raises concerns about health system [2022-01-06T16:30:15Z]": "Norfolk Island is experiencing its first Covid outbreak, with spiralling case numbers forcing more than 10% of the population into isolation and raising concerns about the local health system\u2019s reliance on medical evacuations. \nDeep in the Pacific Ocean, the external Australian territory about 1,500km off the coast of the mainland had gone the duration of the pandemic without recording any local Covid transmission, until the final days of last year. \nOn 30 December, its first cases of Covid were recorded, weeks after the territory reopened to tourists from Queensland and New South Wales where Covid transmission has soared. \n \n  Related: \u2018Falling over in a screaming heap\u2019: overworked staff quit under-resourced NSW regional hospital  \n \nLess than a week later, 35 locals have now tested positive for the virus, with more than 200 of the island\u2019s roughly 2,000 residents forced to isolate. \nIn response, authorities have suspended tourism again, initially for two weeks, to allow its health system \u201cto manage the current level of Covid cases in the community without additional cases from visitors arriving on the island\u201d. \nAs most PCR tests have to be sent to labs offshore, the majority of diagnoses are via rapid antigen tests. The prominent variant on the island has yet to be confirmed, though authorities say it appears to be the Omicron strain. \nMore than 95% of the population has received two doses of Covid vaccine. However, a local resident with knowledge of the health system raised concerns about the capacity for local treatment, and a lack of a contingency plan if the outbreak worsens. \n\u201cPeople will end up dying probably. It\u2019s a pity that it had to end up this way. They had two years to prepare,\u201d the resident, who did not want to be named given the island\u2019s small population, said. \nNorfolk\u2019s only hospital has just seven beds \u2013 one of which can be used for patients requiring acute care and ventilation \u2013 and the small health practice shares a building with the island\u2019s only aged care facility. There is just one permanent doctor on the island. \u201cThe hospital was built in the 1940s, and it looks and runs like it was built in the 1940s,\u201d the resident said. \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nThe median age of residents at the 2016 census was 49, compared to the national average of 38. The resident said many suffer from existing health conditions. More than 32.6% of the population is older than 60. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a very vulnerable population \u2026 and once they\u2019ve got an infection in the hospital, they won\u2019t have any hospital for non-Covid patients. It\u2019s also a problem because it\u2019s next to aged care, and once it gets in there it\u2019s like a death sentence,\u201d said the resident with knowledge of the health system. \n\u201cMedevacs\u201d to the mainland are frequent for broken limbs and other common injuries, and happen \u201cat the drop of a hat\u201d when conditions worsen, the resident said. Evacuations range from approximately $35,000 to $80,000 per medevac, a department of infrastructure spokeswoman said. \nSince Norfolk Island lost the right to self-governance when the Australian government abolished its parliament in 2015, health and education services had been supported by New South Wales. \nHowever, from 1 January this transitioned to Queensland, meaning that medical evacuations will now take residents to be treated in that state. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nEric Hutchinson, the administrator of the island appointed by the Australian government and a former Liberal MP, said the medical evacuation process takes about five hours. But he suggested the island would not rely on evacuations as the Omicron variant of Covid stretches hospitals on the mainland. \n\u201cWe do realise that at the moment, a number of hospitals [on the mainland] have their own challenges. We\u2019re trying to avoid medical evacuation,\u201d Hutchinson said. \nFor now, Queensland Health is providing remote care to Covid patients isolating in their home on the island, in what is termed a \u201cvirtual hospital\u201d. None are in the hospital, which Hutchinson said was because authorities were trying to avoid admitting patients due to the proximity of beds to the aged care facility. \n\u201cThat obviously presents a risk.\u201d \n \n  Related: Covid outbreak at Sydney nursing home leaves residents \u2018petrified\u2019  \n \nHutchinson acknowledged the island\u2019s vulnerability to the virus, but insisted that preparations over the past 18 months had put it in a better position to respond. \n\u201cIt\u2019s quite evident that what is happening on mainland Australia is justifiably concerning for the people of Norfolk, as we are an isolated community with limited medical resources and an older population.\u201d \nHe also acknowledged that while there were plans for a new hospital in coming years, the island\u2019s current facility meant the community was \u201cstill dealing with old infrastructure\u201d when they access healthcare. \nHowever, Hutchinson stressed that \u201cat this point in time we\u2019re alert, not alarmed\u201d. \nIt is also understood that some in the community \u2013 specifically descendants of Bounty Mutineers and their Tahitian brides who settled on Norfolk from Pitcairn Island \u2013 are reluctant to leave the island for medical evacuation because they want to be buried there. \nHutchinson acknowledged this connection many residents have, but suggested this was no different to other parts of regional and remote Australia. \u201cIf in the unfortunate event somebody has to be taken off the island for treatment, their bodies would be repatriated,\u201d he said. \nGuardian Australia contacted Metro North Health, the section of Queensland Health that provides assistance to Norfolk Island with questions about contingency plans for the island if the outbreak deteriorates. \nA spokeswoman said it is continuing to monitor high risk patients remotely and provide advice for local public health measures. \n\u201cMetro North Health will continue to support Norfolk Island as required, with medical evacuations to the mainland set to continue if needed.\u201d", "\u2018We\u2019re struggling\u2019: Covid surge spoils summer for Australia\u2019s hospitality and tourism businesses [2022-01-05T16:30:38Z]": "For Phil Johnson, the licensee of Aireys Pub, keeping the hotel open seven days a week at what should be peak season has instead become a \u201cday-by-day proposition\u201d. \nDuring summer the hotel\u2019s lawn, which boasts spectacular views of the sea and sunset, is usually packed with holidaymakers who have flocked to the Victorian surf coast town of Aireys Inlet to escape Melbourne\u2019s heat. \nBut this year the pub\u2019s takings are on target to be down by about 20% over summer due to a combination of staff being unable to work because they fear they have Covid and people staying away because they don\u2019t want to catch it. \n \n  Related: \u2018I feel abandoned\u2019: Australians waiting hours to be tested and days for their Covid results blame governments  \n \nThe pub is among businesses grappling with a staff shortage crisis gripping hospitality and tourism operations from Victoria to Queensland, as skyrocketing Covid cases caused by the Omicron wave and a shortage of testing keeps workers away from their jobs. \nJohnson said the hotel had also struggled to find staff in the run-up to Christmas because two normal sources of labour \u2013 backpackers and cooks who come from overseas on skilled migration visas \u2013 were unavailable due to the pandemic. \n\u201cWe have 40, 45 staff over this peak period,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAt the moment I\u2019ve probably got about 10 with Covid or suspected Covid, which is making life really hard.\u201d \nHe said workers have been unable to confirm whether they have it because of the long waits for PCR tests at the nearest site, about 30km away in the Geelong suburb of Torquay, and the unavailability of rapid antigen tests. \n\u201cA few people have had like one or two, but I was in Geelong this morning, just going through Chemist Warehouse, but I can\u2019t find any,\u201d he said. \n\u201cOur kitchen\u2019s good, which is good, so it\u2019s just the front of house that we\u2019re struggling with.

[2022-06-27T06:11:01Z]": "Abortion access in Australia is \u201ctracking well\u201d despite attacks from anti-choice groups, experts say, as the world reels from the US supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. \nBut they said that while abortion has been mostly decriminalised, non-legal barriers remain for women across the country. \nCost, geography and \u201cresidual stigma\u201d can make it harder for those living outside cities, people on temporary work visas and other vulnerable groups. \nHere\u2019s the state of play for abortion access in this country. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nIs abortion legal across Australia? \nThe states and territories all have different rules about when and how women can access terminations. Western Australia is the only state or territory where abortion remains under the criminal code. With South Australia as the most recent to decriminalise abortions, with the changes starting on 7 July. \n \n  Related: \u2018Devastating\u2019: Australian politicians respond to US supreme court\u2019s decision on abortion rights  \n \nAcross Australia, medical abortions are available until nine weeks\u2019 gestation (with SA restrictions to lift on 7 July). A medical abortion uses mifepristone to end the pregnancy and misoprostol to expel it. These must be prescribed by a doctor and are taken orally in the form of pills. \nThe limits on surgical abortions vary, from 16 weeks in the ACT to 24 weeks in Victoria, before further approvals are needed. \nThe head of policy at Marie Stopes International (MSI) Australia, Bonney Corbin, said Australia was on track to have universal care by 2030 as outlined in the bipartisan National Women\u2019s Health Strategy. \n\u201cComparatively we\u2019re tracking very well,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI\u2019m confident that commitment will stick. We are in such a good place to keep moving forward with reproductive rights in Australia. We could be leading the world in 2030 if we stick to that trajectory.\u201d \nCorbin said while abortion has largely been decriminalised, some aspects of it remain in criminal law. \u201c[Another] part of the problem is that we have different laws in different states and territories,\u201d she said. \nWhat are the other barriers to accessing abortion? \nIt can cost hundreds of dollars for a medical abortion, and thousands for a surgical termination. \nUnderfunding in the health system is another issue, Corbin said, along with geography. \n\u201cGeography can be a barrier to access \u2013 but that can also be a myth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about having a good GP. \n\u201cTelehealth is now helping, because it\u2019s accessible across Australia for the first time, but it doesn\u2019t suit everyone\u2019s personal circumstances. For some of those women in remote areas, travelling to a city might be a preferable option.\u201d \nIt\u2019s still a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d that determines what access women will get, she said, and those on temporary visas don\u2019t have access to Medicare. Most private health insurers have a year-long waiting period before they\u2019ll provide abortions, and even then not all of them do. \nSome doctors refuse to perform abortions and don\u2019t refer patients on, despite the obligation to, while pharmacists might refuse to supply medical abortion drugs, she said. \n \n  Related: Monday briefing: The devastating consequences of US supreme court\u2019s anti-abortion decision  \n \nDr Tania Penovic, a research group leader in gender and sexuality for the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University, said doctors in a rural town, for example, might also be reliant on work in a Catholic hospital and worry they will be \u201cblacklisted\u201d if they provide or help people get abortions. \n\u201cThe stigma is a real deterrent to working in this area,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWhy would you subject yourself to the possible personal attacks, the threats?\u201d \nPenovic\u2019s 2021 study published in the Women\u2019s Studies International Forum found the three main non-legal barriers to abortion access were financial, geographic, and \u201cdeficiencies in practitioner attitudes, education and training\u201d. \nThe barriers have been amplified during the pandemic, she found, generating a \u201cdisproportionate and intersectional impact on the most marginalised and disempowered women in society\u201d including women with disabilities, refugees and First Nations women. \nAbusive partners can also control reproductive and sexual choices, through rape, sabotaging contraception, refusing to use contraception and then controlling women\u2019s access to abortion. \nWhat is the likelihood of abortion rights being rolled back? \nCorbin said the anti-choice movement was \u201cnoisy\u201d and could contribute to a stigma around abortion but was unlikely to influence policy. \n\u201cIn Australia, the anti-choice movement is funded by the US, which can give them a large platform and a lot of noise, but that noise doesn\u2019t equate to power,\u201d she said. \n\u201cWhile they may seem active, they\u2019re not going to influence change. \n\u201c[But] the rhetoric contributes to stigma, which spreads shame and doom around reproductive rights. It drains energy, but if we can focus on the fact that Australia is progressing towards reproductive justice, we can celebrate the fact that we are groundbreaking right now.\u201d \n \n  Related: Women must be allowed to defend abortion as a sex-based right | Sonia Sodha  \n \nPenovic said women\u2019s rights are \u201chard-fought\u201d and can be \u201ceasily lost\u201d. \nFor example in 1996, independent senator Brian Harradine (who held the balance of power) struck a deal with the Howard government to support a partial privatisation of Telstra in return for giving then health minister Tony Abbott the power to veto the import, manufacture or use of abortion drug RU486. \nIt took more than a decade to overturn that power, and there are still cost and access problems stopping women getting medical abortions, as well as surgical ones. \n\u201cAustralia is tracking relatively well, but I think what this shows us is that women\u2019s rights, gender equality is hard-fought and needs to be carefully protected because it\u2019s vulnerable,\u201d Penovic said. \u201cIt can very easily be lost.\u201d \nShe said while the pandemic and the closure of some Marie Stopes clinics made access more complicated for some, telehealth made it easier for others. And she said that US-inspired anti-abortion movements were active in Australia. \n\u201cWhile it\u2019s right to celebrate our victories, the politicisation of healthcare has real implications for access and what we see in the US is a perfect example of that,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThe other thing we\u2019ve found is that, because of the residual stigma because of decades of criminalisation, we do have a problem.\u201d \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nPenovic said while the situation in Australia was \u201cvery different\u201d to that in the US, \u201cwe can\u2019t rest on our laurels\u201d.  \n\u201cThe politicisation of the issue, and how people can be brainwashed \u2013 it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d \nWhat are the rules in each state and territory? \n \n In the ACT, abortion is legal up to 16 weeks\u2019 gestation and must be performed by a doctor or a nurse. After 16 weeks, the patient will need to travel interstate. \n In New South Wales, abortions can be performed at up to 22 weeks. After that, two doctors must approve the procedure. \n In the Northern Territory, one doctor can approve and perform an abortion at up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, two doctors need to approve an abortion. \n In Queensland, abortions can be performed at up to 22 weeks. After 22 weeks, two doctors must approve the procedure. \n In SA, from 7 July, abortions are allowed until 22 weeks and six days, after which two doctors have to agree that it is necessary. \n In Tasmania, abortions can be performed at up to 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, two doctors must approve the procedure. \n In Victoria, abortions can be performed at up to 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, two doctors must approve the procedure. \n In WA, abortions can be performed at up to 20 weeks with the approval of two doctors. Termination after 20 weeks has to be approved by a panel of six doctors. \n", "Here come the lorikeets! How garden trends can change the local wildlife [2022-04-02T20:00:06Z]": "My bird-watching friend Simon is telling me about the parrots he sees on his daily walks around Canberra. It is a long list, which includes five types of cockatoos. When he gets to the tenth parrot species \u2013 \u201cred-rumps. Everyone loves those\u201d \u2013 he stops to think. The eleventh is the rainbow lorikeet. \u201cThey\u2019re newcomers,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve really taken off.\u201d I find it difficult to imagine a city without rainbow lorikeets. I am in far north Queensland and they are everywhere. Street trees are filled with shrieking, whistling birds. Flocks fly past in tight formation. Everything about them is frantic \u2013 from their nectar-guzzling to their psychedelic plumage. According to BirdLife Australia\u2019s annual Aussie Backyard Bird Count, the rainbow lorikeet is the most abundant species in the eastern states. Every year since the count began in 2014, the bird has been ranked No 1 one nationwide. But in Canberra, the species is a recent arrival. It is making up for lost time.    Neil Hermes, a freelance ornithologist and the president of the Canberra Ornithology Group (Cog), has been keeping an eye on bird populations in the national capital. Long-term data collected by the Cog show lorikeet numbers rocketing. \u201cIn the 1980s, there were no rainbow lorikeets in Canberra,\u201d Hermes tells me. \u201cNow they\u2019re one of the most common birds.\u201d So where did they come from?   Related: \u2018It\u2019s not rocket science\u2019: how the world\u2019s fastest parrot could be saved    When small numbers of rainbow lorikeets first appeared in the city, they were thought to have been aviary escapers. Cage birds might have contributed, but, Hermes says, it is highly likely that Canberra\u2019s population grew from individuals who wandered west from the coast and found the city\u2019s parks and gardens to their liking. Canberra\u2019s extensive plantings of native trees and shrubs offer plenty of food and nesting sites. The Molonglo River, lakes Burley Griffin and Ginninderra, and the creeks, ponds and wetlands around the city provide a reliable water supply.   Interactive   \u201cRainbow Lorikeets are good at adapting to urban habitat and Canberra has created a large amount of new habitat,\u201d Hermes says. \u201cIt is a fabulous city for birds. Conditions are perfect for them.\u201d The lorikeets\u2019 association with inland towns is made strikingly obvious by maps of sightings from the Australian Capital Territory and adjacent areas. The largest numbers are from Canberra and neighbouring Queanbeyan, followed by Yass and Goulburn, with a few records for small rural towns like Bungendore. Sightings are almost absent from the surrounding country. Decades of data show that the birds prefer to settle in built up areas.    While other species suffer from the impact of urban encroachment, rainbow lorikeets belong to a small group that thrives around humans. These \u201curban adapters\u201d include Australian magpies, magpie-larks, crested pigeons, noisy miners, and even eastern koels. Koels are turning up in Canberra in rapidly increasing numbers, paralleling the lorikeets\u2019 pattern of none, to some, to many. Flying in from New Guinea and Indonesia, these migratory cuckoos arrive in spring to breed in northern and eastern Australia. The birds are difficult to spot \u2013 males are glossy black, and the females are mosaics of brown and cream \u2013 but they are easy to hear. The male\u2019s insistent ko-el ko-el ko-el is now part of the city\u2019s nocturnal soundscape. It might be a blessing for Canberra\u2019s birdwatchers, but not for those species in whose nests koels lay their eggs \u2013 or for light sleepers. While some urban adapters are only reclaiming their natural ranges, rainbow lorikeets and eastern koels are extending theirs into fresh territory.    Range expansion is not confined to birds. In the 1980s, grey-headed flying foxes started roosting in Melbourne, setting up a camp in the city\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens, about 450km west of their closest colony. By 2011, they had established a presence in Adelaide. Like lorikeets, the bats benefit from planted trees and the presence of permanent water. They are now a familiar sight in many suburbs. Individuals may turn up, but unless the conditions are right, the species \u2013 bird, bat or butterfly \u2013 cannot become established. The monarch or wanderer butterfly, native to North America and capable of flying great distances, made its way to Australia in the late 1800s. But until its food plants, tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) and cotton bush (the gomphocarpus species), became established as garden ornamentals, it could not breed successfully.    Another butterfly, the tawny coster from Asia, was first recorded in Australia in 2012. Since then, it has spread across the tropics and, in the past year or so, northern New South Wales. The tawny coster has not had to rely on parks and gardens; its principal food plant, the delicate blue spade flower (pigea enneaspermus), is native to the warmer parts of the country. In the Australian Botanic Gardens in Canberra is a deep, sheltered gully filled with luxuriant tree ferns and other rainforest plants.

But Sims stopped short of criticising the federal government, saying that while \u201cclearly demand is outstripping supply\u201d, it was unclear what was causing the shortages. \n\u201cThe pricing of these is not something I\u2019m going to comment on, obviously you can see both sides of that argument,\u201d Sims said in response to questions about whether the tests should be provided free. \n \n  Related: Covid-positive nurses are working in NSW hospitals due to severe staffing shortages  \n \nOn Tuesday, New South Wales and Victoria registered record daily case numbers. NSW had 23,131 new cases, while Victoria recorded 14,020. \nQueensland registered a record 5,699 cases, while South Australia had 3,246 new cases, the ACT 926, Tasmania 702 and the Northern Territory 75. \nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said the government will not make the rapid tests free for everyone, but is in the process of finalising concessional access with state and territory leaders. National cabinet is expected to sign off on the details in a meeting on Wednesday. \nRegardless of the cost, supplies remain constrained in the private market across the country, with frustration growing that the tests cannot be found on chemist and supermarket shelves. \nThe Queensland health minister, Yvette D\u2019Ath, said Queensland would distribute 500,000 RATs to public testing clinics from Wednesday, but supplies remain constrained across the country. \n\u201cThis is happening across the country.

And his job is to ensure supply, just like it was his job to secure supply of the vaccine,\u201d Albanese said. \nBut the opposition leader fell short of saying the tests should be made free. \n\u201cWe think that if someone needs a rapid antigen test, and they can\u2019t afford it, they should get one. Everyone should have access to a rapid antigen test. It shouldn\u2019t be dependent upon your income.\u201d \nHowever his NSW counterpart, Chris Minns, went further, saying on Tuesday that the NSW Labor party believed the state was facing an \u201curgent situation\u201d and that the tests \u201cneed to be free of charge\u201d. \n\u201cThis is what is happening in other jurisdictions around the world.

But that doesn\u2019t mean we can live without a government.\u201d \nThe Nationals senator Matt Canavan said the TGA was to blame for the hold-up, and said making the tests free would exacerbate demand. \n\u201cThe hold-up was at the feet of the TGA,\u201d he told Sky News on Tuesday. \n\u201cWe should have been better prepared for this.\u201d", "Morning mail: voters\u2019 top priorities, Coalition climate plans \u2018catastrophic\u2019, Putin\u2019s \u2018girlfriend\u2019 faces sanctions [2022-05-05T20:46:26Z]": "Good morning.

Reducing the cost of living and fixing the aged care system are voters\u2019 two top priorities, according to a Australian National University poll. The survey of more than 3,500 people found those two issues transcended the political divide, with more than 60% nominating them as top priorities, ranking ahead of issues of more concern to Coalition voters, including defence against terrorist attacks and reducing crime. A majority of voters also nominated strengthening the nation\u2019s economy (54.4%), reducing the cost of healthcare (53.5%) and dealing with global climate change (52.8%) as top priorities for the federal government. \nThe Morrison government\u2019s climate change commitments are consistent with more than 3C of global heating, bordering on 4C, a level that would lead to catastrophic damage across the planet, according to a new analysis.

Both would be expected to lead to the loss of tropical coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef, and a significant rise in the number of extreme heat events in Australia, assuming other countries took equivalent action. The research by Climate Analytics found neither major party had emissions reduction goals that lived up to the commitment that was strengthened in last year\u2019s Glasgow climate pact, to aim to limit heating to as close as possible to 1.5C.

This is partly because people have been urged to register positive tests dating back to 1 January. \n \n  Related: NSW hospitals bracing for tripling of Covid patients  \n \nThis is a jump of about 29,000 from the 53,000 results posted by Wednesday afternoon. \nOf the cases registered by Wednesday afternoon, 34,249 had come from the past seven days, with the remaining third dating back to 1 January. \n\u201cLook it is a big number [but] as you\u2019d expect,\u201d Dominello told 2GB on Wednesday. \n\u201cCovid is not just here in NSW, it\u2019s in Queensland, it\u2019s in Victoria, it\u2019s in South Australia and all throughout Europe.

From Friday, people in both states who live with Covid-19 cases or are deemed close contacts will no longer have to quarantine for seven days, provided they have no symptoms. Instead, they will be required to undertake rapid antigen tests, wear masks while indoors, work from home where possible and avoid high-risk settings such as aged care and hospitals.   Related: NSW and Victoria to scrap Covid isolation requirements for household and close contacts    In Victoria, patrons will no longer need to show proof of their vaccination status to enter hospitality or entertainment venues, and check-in QR codes will no longer be required anywhere. The state also dropped mask requirements in primary schools, early childhood centres, hospitality, retail and events, bringing it largely in line with NSW and Queensland. However, Victoria is keeping vaccination mandates for key workers at this stage, while in NSW it has been lifted for all but aged care and disability workers. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, welcomed the announcements, telling reporters in Adelaide: \u201cThey are getting back to normal. Hallelujah.\u201d Industry groups also praised the Victoria and NSW governments, describing the scrapping of the seven-day isolation for household contacts as an enormous relief for businesses severely affected by staff shortages. \u201cThe removal of these isolation requirements in NSW and Victoria are an important step on the path towards living with Covid and are an example for the other jurisdictions to follow,\u201d the Australian Retailers Association CEO, Paul Zahra, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, and into the third year of this pandemic.

Related: Victoria and NSW Covid restrictions: what\u2019s changing and when do you still have to isolate or wear a mask?    The views among epidemiologists, however, were mixed. Prof Mike Toole from the Burnet Institute said he was disappointed by the announcements, saying daily Covid cases were far too high to justify the changes. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s been thought through particularly carefully. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a clear strategy. I don\u2019t know what our objectives are any more,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe message that it sends on Friday is basically that it\u2019s all over, the pandemic is in the past tense. And it\u2019s clearly not. Anyone who looks at the numbers knows it\u2019s not in the past.\u201d Toole said Australia currently had one of the world\u2019s highest rates of new cases a day, averaging dozens of deaths daily. \u201cHow can you say we\u2019re entering a new phase of the pandemic when we reported 50,966 new cases [on Wednesday]?\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are still living in the belief that Australia somehow avoided the worst of the pandemic, they don\u2019t seem to mind the fact that more than 4,000 people have died from Covid in less than four months this year. That\u2019s twice as many as the combined number of deaths in 2020 and 2021.\u201d Victoria recorded 14 deaths and 10,628 new infections on Wednesday, while NSW recorded 15 deaths and 15,414 cases. Authorities in both jurisdictions are confident they have passed the peak of the latest Omicron wave. University of Melbourne epidemiologist Prof Nancy Baxter said the further easing of restrictions would mean the country would not be able to reduce its daily case tally before heading into winter.   Related: In a pandemic of medical misinformation, how do you deal with conspiracy believers?    \u201cIf we relax all restrictions, what we\u2019re going to find is we have a plateau \u2013 a high number of cases on an ongoing basis \u2013 that leads to a lot of hospitalisation, significant amount of death and a lot of long Covid,\u201d she told ABC News Breakfast. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re setting ourselves up for by basically wanting to act like it\u2019s 2019.\u201d Australian National University infectious disease expert Prof Peter Collignon, however, did not expect there to be a huge spike in cases because of the changes, citing high vaccination rates and a large proportion of the population having already had the virus. \u201cThe vast majority of the Australian population have had a booster already with either the vaccine or a natural infection, so I think from the point of view of hospitalisation and death, it won\u2019t be as bad as I was expecting this winter,\u201d he said. \u201cWill we see cases? Yes, we will. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see another huge peak, though.\u201d Collignon said Australia has reached a new phase in the pandemic, thanks to vaccination uptake, the milder Omicron variant and the availability of new treatments. \u201cOur outlook as far as death and serious disease is concerned is much, much better than it was a year-and-a-half ago, which allows us to change how we react to it,\u201d he said.

While the federal and some state governments have developed guidelines that allow medical practitioners to treat mature minors without parental consent, some providers are not aware of these and even if they are, are still worried about potential legal issues or find them confusing, Massie said. \u201cIn some states, like Queensland and Victoria, it\u2019s clear that the 12- to 15-year-old group should be able to get vaccinated under their own steam,\u201d he told the MJA Insight podcast. \u201cIn South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales, you need a parent\u2019s consent, but in NSW it\u2019s messy depending on who you ask.\u201d However, it is always ethical to assess each child and teenager on an individual basis, Massie and his colleagues wrote, and to vaccinate if certain considerations have been made.
