It's hard to believe no one, not even the show's creator David Simon has matched the quality of this show since. \\n\\nEven the cinematography (I'm watching in bluray in wide aspect ratio - which it was originally filmed in) is just a chef's kiss. You can pause it at any moment and it just looks art worthy.\\n\\nI can see why this show wasn't a hit when it first aired as it's a slow burn. It really suits the binge format. And I often do find myself rewinding and putting in subtitles as some of the fast American way of speaking is hard to pick up. \\n\\nSuch a glorious show. If you've never watched it, I highly recommend just giving it a chance.\\n\\nDominic West in particular, such a charming lead. And it's great to see Lance Reddick again. \\n\\nI'm currently on season. Cannot wait to get back on the wild ride of the ever changing setting in Baltimore. One of the reasons I loved it back when I first watched it was this anthology-esque aspect of setting in a different place, or focusing it on a different aspect of crime each season. Plus, the ever changing cast.\",\n",

It&amp;#39;s hard to believe no one, not even the show&amp;#39;s creator David Simon has matched the quality of this show since. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even the cinematography (I&amp;#39;m watching in bluray in wide aspect ratio - which it was originally filmed in) is just a chef&amp;#39;s kiss. You can pause it at any moment and it just looks art worthy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can see why this show wasn&amp;#39;t a hit when it first aired as it&amp;#39;s a slow burn. It really suits the binge format. And I often do find myself rewinding and putting in subtitles as some of the fast American way of speaking is hard to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Such a glorious show. If you&amp;#39;ve never watched it, I highly recommend just giving it a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dominic West in particular, such a charming lead. And it&amp;#39;s great to see Lance Reddick again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently on season. Cannot wait to get back on the wild ride of the ever changing setting in Baltimore. One of the reasons I loved it back when I first watched it was this anthology-esque aspect of setting in a different place, or focusing it on a different aspect of crime each season. Plus, the ever changing cast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
