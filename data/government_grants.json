{"Ex-LNP president oversaw transfer of $500,000 in Morrison government grant money to brother\u2019s offset account, court hears [2023-12-21T08:24:43Z]": "Money from a federal government grant \u2013 awarded in the dying days of the Morrison government \u2013 was transferred into a mortgage offset account controlled by the brother of the former president of the Queensland Liberal National party, a court has heard. Guardian Australia reported in October that Green Day Energy \u2013 a fledgling \u201cgreen coal\u201d company \u2013 had had its bank account frozen and become mired in legal action, 18 months after being awarded a $5.5m commonwealth grant. In a judgment on Thursday, the federal court judge Roger Derrington found that the former LNP president David Hutchinson had breached his duties as a director of the company, was unfit to remain in financial control and had been \u201cprepared to misapply the company\u2019s funds rather audaciously for his own benefit and for the benefit of his relatives\u201d. In his judgment, Derrington detailed claims about \u201csuspicious transactions\u201d from the $5.5m grant awarded to Green Day Energy to convert prickly acacia, an invasive outback weed, into woodchip pellets with properties similar to coal.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Those transactions included a $500,000 transfer from the company to the mortgage offset account of Hutchinson\u2019s brother Stephen and to Stephen\u2019s wife. The transaction was included in an expenditure report, submitted to the federal government, as being paid to an engineering company for \u201cplant and equipment\u201d. \u201cThat description was false,\u201d Derrington said. \u201cAlthough [David] Hutchinson was responsible for the accounts, he had no explanation as to why the recipient of the funds and the use to which they were being put were misleadingly represented in this way. \u201cIt seems that the effect of the transfer to the offset account was to reduce the amount of interest that Mr Stephen Hutchinson and his wife were required to pay on their loan. \u201cDespite [David] Hutchinson\u2019s assertions to the contrary, there was no valid reason for Green Day Energy\u2019s funds to have been used in that manner.\u201d The judgment says Hutchinson conceded in cross-examination that he had not sought approval from the board of Green Day Energy before transferring the money.   Related: \u2018Green coal\u2019 company owned by LNP figures received $5.5m grant a week before Morrison government entered caretaker mode    \u201cWhilst Mr Hutchinson and his brother have returned the $500,000 to the account of Green Day Energy, and may have paid some interest on the sum, that cannot negate the obvious impropriety of the transaction that was undertaken,\u201d it says. \u201cIndeed, it gives the appearance merely that they were trying to restore some of their credibility once they were caught in the process of, quite unmistakably, misusing the company\u2019s funds.\u201d The court also heard that Green Day Energy had bought two motor vehicles. One of those, a Nissan Navara, had been bought by Hutchinson \u201cpurportedly for Green Day Energy, but was registered in his own name and not that of the company\u201d. The other, a Ford Ranger, was used by his brother \u201cexclusively for his own purposes, and stored at his private residence\u201d. \u201cThese dealings by Mr Hutchinson reinforce the view that he has been prepared to misapply the company\u2019s funds rather audaciously for his own benefit and for the benefit of his relatives,\u201d the judgment says. \u201cSuch behaviour is offensive to ordinary understandings of sound financial management. It strengthens the conclusion that he should not remain in a position where he enjoys financial control over Green Day Energy.\u201d The judgment says Hutchinson\u2019s \u201cpermitting \u2013 if not actively facilitating \u2013 the misuse of company funds for his benefit and the benefit of his brother\u201d was a \u201cserious\u201d breach of his statutory and fiduciary duties.  \u201cAdditionally, it is a matter of great concern that, in the course of his crossexamination, he was seemingly unable to acknowledge that certain of the dealings with his brother were inappropriate,\u201d the judgment said. The court ruled that Hutchinson had invalidly placed Green Day Energy into administration amid a dispute with his business partner, the former LNP official and candidate Brad Carswell. The court also found that Carswell\u2019s removal as a director of Green Day Energy was invalid. It ordered both of those actions voided. The company was registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission three days before Christmas in 2021 \u2013 the same day that the federal government released the grant guidelines for its \u201csecuring raw minerals program\u201d. The grant was approved by the then minister for regionalisation, Bridget McKenzie, after being assessed by the government business grants hub and reviewed by a committee. McKenzie made several election announcements in the following weeks about regional businesses awarded money from the $29m securing raw minerals program. The grant to Green Day Energy does not appear to have been announced until after the election. A spokesperson for McKenzie told Guardian Australia in October that the office of the former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, had taken carriage of an announcement because McKenzie was not visiting the region. \u201cTo the best of our recollection the former minister did not meet or speak with Green Day Energy prior to the grant being awarded,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cSenator McKenzie was the responsible minister for the program, which was a competitive grants program.\u201d The federal government is \u201cconsidering its position\u201d in relation to the grant. Guardian Australia has approached David Hutchinson for comment.", "Aged care analyst warns of \u2018alarming lack of transparency\u2019 in how churches spend government grants [2023-04-26T01:42:11Z]": "Religious institutions that run aged care homes do not have to show they are spending millions of dollars in government grants on resident care thanks to an \u201calarming lack of transparency\u201d in the system, an industry analyst has claimed. Jason Ward of the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research pointed to the example of Blue Care, which has about 47 residential aged care facilities with 5,173 residents. Blue Care is run by UnitingCare Queensland, which sent $25.7m to the Queensland synod of the Uniting church last financial year. The source of this money is not revealed in financial statements as UnitingCare Queensland does not provide segmented breakdowns for its many operations. Blue Care is not required to file a separate financial statement. The $25.7m went towards chaplaincy services, insurance premiums, stewardship fees, \u201credress and sensitive matters contributions\u201d and \u201cother expenses\u201d. It is not clear whether this money came from more than $500m in government grants received by UnitingCare Queensland.   Related: Australian aged care providers accused of \u2018crying poor\u2019 to lobby for government funding    At the end of the last financial year, UnitingCare Queensland also had $218.9m in deposits with Uniting Church Investment Services, a fund used to maximise returns for church initiatives. The source of that money is also not clear in reports. \u201cThis return may be through income to support missional activities and programs of the church and to reduce borrowing required for growth and capital development,\u201d the church website said. It is not suggested UnitingCare Queensland has done anything illegal or unethical. Ward said the lack of transparency was alarming given the sector\u2019s ongoing calls for more federal funding to continue operating. \u201cThere are significant concerns that federal aged care funding may be siphoned off to fund other church activities and the growth of other largely publicly funded business at the expense of residents and care workers,\u201d Ward said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  UnitingCare Queensland also runs the suicide prevention service Lifeline and the Wesley, St Stephen\u2019s, Buderim Private and St Andrew\u2019s War Memorial hospitals. When asked whether any federal funds have been allocated to anything other than the delivery of aged care services, a UnitingCare Queensland spokesperson said all of its property, including residential aged care homes, was owned by the United church\u2019s trust fund. \u201cAs such, each year the Queensland Synod of the Uniting Church provides a range of services to UnitingCare Queensland, including the management of insurance and property administration, which enables UnitingCare Queensland to provide all of its services to the Queensland community,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAccordingly, the trust receives fees from across all activities of the church to support the work of all agencies and entities owned by the trust.\u201d The spokesperson did not say whether those fees were sourced from government grants, or from revenue generated by resident fees. Ward, whose organisation is funded by unions including those with aged care workers, said there was an urgent need to improve transparency so governments can know what funds are being used for and hold companies accountable if necessary. \u201cThe public needs assurance and evidence that funding is going towards improving staffing and care and not being used to extract greater profits or fund acquisitions or property developments,\u201d Ward said. Last month, Blue Care announced the closure of its Millbank aged care facility in Bundaberg, citing financial and staffing pressures that are acute in regional towns. \u201cOur facility at Millbank is old and requires significant investment in refurbishment to bring it up to the standard required to accommodate the increasing acuity in residents entering residential aged care,\u201d a spokesperson said at the time. \u201cAs a not-for-profit organisation, these factors have impacted the financial viability of our site.\u201d Assessing the financial viability of Blue Care is difficult as it is not required to provide its own financial statements. UnitingCare Queensland recorded a $16.7m surplus last financial year. Aged care and community services generated $701m in revenue, or roughly 40% of overall revenue. The federal government has improved transparency by requiring aged care providers to disclose their finances quarterly, in response to the aged care royal commission. While more than three-quarters of home care providers recorded a profit in the latest update, 66% of residential aged care providers recorded a loss. Collectively, residential providers lost $465m in three months, or an average of nearly $28 per resident. Staffing is a major cost as providers often rely on agency workers with higher rates, as they cannot attract permanent staff to work in an historically underpaid industry. Ward did not dispute many providers need more funds, but accused some providers of \u201ccrying poor\u201d and misleading the public about their finances. \u201cBefore additional funding is provided, there needs to be far greater transparency and accountability to ensure spending improves care rather than increase profits or fund expansion and development,\u201d Ward said.", "\u2018It\u2019s slipped off the radar\u2019: why are there fewer street trees in regional towns across Australia? [2024-01-03T14:00:05Z]": "Regional Australia\u2019s back yards and nature strips need more trees to combat extreme heat and make rural towns more livable, experts say. Increasing shade cover in cities and towns can dramatically reduce surface temperatures and encourage walking and cycling. But as many metropolitan councils set ambitious tree canopy targets, budget constraints, fewer incentives and social attitudes mean some regional areas are lagging behind. Dr Laurel Johnson from the University of Queensland says increasing tree canopy cover in regional towns is one of the few tools available to ameliorate extreme summer temperatures exacerbated by global heating. \u201cWhen there are more days over 40C, your tree canopy becomes really critical in cooling a township,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cWe are sort of in tune with that phenomenon in more urbanised areas but regional towns don\u2019t seem to be.\u201d Awnings and street trees provide shade and create a welcoming environment for pedestrians, Johnson says, but they are often confined to the high street. \u201cIf you then need to walk to another part of town, you\u2019ll find yourself quickly exposed to the elements,\u201d she says. Johnson says the prioritisation of cars over public transport and pathways for pedestrians in many regional towns mean the benefits of street trees have not been fully realised.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  \u201cRegional towns are much more concerned with the quality of the bitumen,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThat will trump tree planting every time.\u201d More space, more resistance Landscape restoration projects in regional areas can initially be met with strong community opposition, says Greening Australia Queensland program officer Freddy Herrera. \u201cYou have this fightback of people thinking that you\u2019re just going to make everything bush,\u201d Herrera says. \u201cHaving been part of a regional community you understand it \u2013 it\u2019s almost an attitude of: \u2018We have always done it this way, why change?\u2019\u201d Herrera says community consultation and a fire management plan were a vital part of getting approval for a project outside Gatton in Queensland\u2019s Lockyer Valley, where the not-for-profit planted native shrubs and trees along an eroded creek. But he says the town does not have a broader strategy to increase the urban canopy. \u201cIn rural areas you have more space [for trees] but you are fighting a bit of resistance,\u201d Herrera says. \u201cIn the cities you have mostly positive attitudes but you are constricted by space.\u201d   Related:How can cities help trees survive extreme heat?    West of Gatton, on the Darling Downs, tree planting efforts have been mixed. The Toowoomba regional council has planted tens of thousands of trees on council land and distributed thousands more free tree vouchers to residents, resulting in an estimated 2% to 5% increase in the urban canopy since 2011.  In the neighbouring Western Downs regional council, 8,000 trees have been planted on kerbs since 2017 as part of an \u201cadopt a tree\u201d program. But to the south, the Goondiwindi regional council said while it is \u201cextremely proud\u201d of its tree-lined streets, it doesn\u2019t have a plan to increase its urban canopy. In the Southern Downs regional council there had been no effort to increase the number of trees until December 2023, when the council announced it had secured a $100k federal government grant to plant trees. Prof Thomas Astell-Burt from the University of Wollongong says the percentage of tree canopy cover can vary widely between council areas. In the Sydney suburb of Ryde, tree canopy has decreased from 40% to 33% in seven years due in part to a large number of subdivisions in the area. In the regional city of Wollongong, the council has set an ambitious target to increase urban canopy cover to 34% by 2037. It\u2019s currently estimated at just 17%. Astell-Burt says tree preservation is just as important as planting new trees, to avoid an overall decrease in canopy growth overtime. And he says the benefits go beyond shade: \u201cTree-lined streets present opportunities for serendipitous conversations with neighbours that in turn builds social capital, improves mental health and reduces loneliness.\u201d    \u2018Easily a null issue\u2019 Dr Jennifer Kent from the University of Sydney says many of the arguments for increasing urban tree canopy cover \u2013 namely the health benefits of regularly interacting with nature and parkland \u2013 are less persuasive in regional areas than in large cities because there is easier access to natural bushland.   Related: Purple people pleasers: jacarandas burst into bloom after record-breaking rains     \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be a good thing to plant trees,\u201d Kent says. \u201cBut regional areas are quite often really well endowed with public open spaces \u2013 I can see how from a policy perspective it\u2019s slipped off the radar a bit.\u201d The layout of regional towns, with fewer buildings spaced further apart, also lessens the impact of urban heat islands, which have been a major driver of ambitious urban tree planting programs, Kent says.  It is also harder to persuade people to switch from cars to walking or cycling in regional towns, despite the shorter distances traversed, because the lack of traffic and availability of parking makes them the \u201cperfect environment\u201d for car dependency. Ian Plowman, a former psychologist and social researcher, said land ballots conducted throughout the 20th century \u2013 where crown land was handed out to prospective farmers on the condition it was clearcut and productive \u2013 may also have shaped the perception of large-scale tree-planting projects in regional Australia. \u201cIn regional areas, do people find trees appealing, or do they signal a loss of productivity?\u201d he says.

North Sydney Olympic Pool fostered the careers of Australian swimming greats including Dawn Fraser, Frank O\u2019Neill and Shane Gould \u2013 86 world records were smashed there \u2013 and delivered exercise and respite from the heat to thousands of others. When it closed for redevelopment in February 2021, veteran members expected to plunge back into the same pool, albeit brought up to world-class standards, late the following year. Three years on, two of them have died while waiting for it to reopen. \u201cFor three years I\u2019ve looked down on to the pool and for three years I\u2019ve seen it standing still and I\u2019ve got tears in my eyes,\u201d says local Ben Forsyth, an avid swimmer and property consultant. \u201cOne veteran swam there for 53 years. Before he died, he told me \u2018I wish I could leave with one last swim.\u2019 It was heartbreaking.\u201d Beset with council infighting, claims of pork-barrelling and a lack of transparency, heritage concerns and criticism from health organisations, what has been billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s most beautiful pool\u201d has become a gaping hole with the budget blown out to more than $100m and the opening extended to a still unknown date \u2013 perhaps 2025.    \u201cThis is a really good example of how not to do an infrastructure project,\u201d says the independent federal member for North Sydney, Kylea Tink. Her sentiments echo those of the North Sydney mayor, Zoe Baker, whose council is running and mostly funding the project. \u201cThe community just wanted a pool,\u201d Baker says, wearily. *** If there is a single moment at which the pool plans unravelled, it is as contested as the project itself. For Tink, problems began in April 2019, when the federal government gave the pool a $10m government grant meant for regional and remote women\u2019s sports. The pre-election cash injection shifted the inner-city project up a gear, she argues, muddying what would have been a relatively straightforward renovation of a historic asset.      The windfall, as Baker puts it, was like winning a raffle in which councillors hadn\u2019t bought a ticket. \u201cThe consequence of suddenly being given $10m more was that the scope of the project had to reopen,\u201d Tink says. From then on, she claims, governance of the project was questionable. Baker looks further back, to 2018, when consultation was ignored, she says, in favour of a grander, more expensive design than the community wanted. But the former mayor Jilly Gibson, whose tenure oversaw the entire redevelopment planning process and the beginning of the build, believes problems appeared the moment Baker took office in January 2022.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  The story began years earlier, in July 2013, with plans for the belated restoration of the pool, which first opened in 1936. The changing rooms were dark and dank, large bubbles occasionally appeared on the bottom of the lap pool, its lining badly in need of repair. Concrete cancer riddled the 25-metre indoor pool\u2019s foundations. \u201cIt was definitely overdue for a refurb,\u201d says freestyle and breaststroke champion Matt Levy, who trained at the pool every day from 2017 until 2020 in preparation for the Tokyo Paralympics. Community consultation began in 2014, with 1,785 respondents helping to choose one of seven designs. In November 2017 option two was settled upon, with initial costings set at a debt-free $28m.   Related: \u2018The best in the world\u2019: a love letter to Australia\u2019s public pools    In March 2019, council updated the budget to $57.9m. Then came the unexpected $10m election sweetener. An additional $5m was provided by the New South Wales government. The publicly exhibited plans sparked controversy, with the replacement of the indoor pool, built in 2000, mired in heritage concerns and the Cancer Council lambasting the removal of a sun shade over the children\u2019s pool. Development plans were approved in July 2020. That December, the budget was bumped up to $63.9m. That figure did not include some $4m spent over the previous seven years. On New Year\u2019s Eve that year came the announcement that the building contract had been awarded to Icon SI, the construction company behind Sydney Olympic Park\u2019s Opal Tower.    Building started on the pool in March 2021. The Covid pandemic, La Ni\u00f1a and the removal of hazardous materials all ate into construction days. Last April, the budget was increased to $86m while an independent review by PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants predicted it to top $89m. The completion date was moved to April 2024. Then, in November, the entire new steel frame over the indoor pool had to be torn down and recommissioned after the discovery of design and structural \u201cissues\u201d. A further $20m was committed to in February and the opening date revised to \u201clate 2024/early 2025\u201d. The budget exceeded $100m. Icon SI says it is working collaboratively with council to have the pool completed as soon as possible. \u201cWe remain confident that, when completed, the North Sydney pool redevelopment will more than live up to the high standards expected,\u201d a spokesperson said.    We have a community to apologise to.  North Sydney councillor James Spenceley     Today, building is halfway through: in addition to the structural modernisation the 87-year-old pool needed, the swimmers of North Sydney can look forward to a new family play area and creche as well as an updated grandstand, gym and sauna. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need all the extra activities. It\u2019s too clever by half,\u201d says Forsyth, whose fury over the pool\u2019s mishandling fizzes down the phone line. \u201cFour years for a swimming pool \u2013 come on, please.\u201d With limited options for locals to swim laps, and for young people to learn to swim or hone their competitive edge, he intends to secure 1,000 signatures demanding the reopening of the pool by October. \u201cWe just need to get it done. We just need to know October 1 is the day we\u2019re going to be cutting the ribbon and we\u2019ll put all this behind us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are not going into 2025. No way.\u201d *** Baker, however, refuses to rush. She claims she is \u201ccleaning up the mess left behind\u201d by the previous council, whose efforts she criticised as \u201cpoorly conceived, poorly planned and poorly budgeted\u201d in a mayoral minute \u2013 a matter overriding usual council business \u2013 in February. Gibson argues that the project was more or less on budget and on time when she left office. It wasn\u2019t, Baker claims. The New Year\u2019s Eve construction contract was signed before designs were complete and budgets didn\u2019t give the full picture and were inadequate, she argues. Costs including insurance and fit-out were not included.    Between 2018 and 2020, Baker and two allied councillors voted against what she called a \u201cbloated, expensive vanity project\u201d 23 times. She urged the Office of Local Government to act and complained to the ombudsman. \u201cIt is not the bread and butter of councils to do $60m, $70m projects,\u201d she says, arguing that the size of the task swelled beyond the scope of a local council. But the mayoral minute, argues Gibson, is political and \u201ca load of absolute bollocks\u201d. The $28m budget was only a \u201crough estimate\u201d and the community wanted a pool for the future, she says. \u201cThe mayor is sounding desperate here. Every single thing that happened with the pool was signed off at an ordinary council meeting.\u201d In late 2022, PWC was commissioned to review the project and its 16 findings and 33 recommendations were made public last April.    Chief among them was that the project was under-budgeted and that the council unusually entered into separate design and construction contracts, as well as opting to manage the project in-house in an attempt to reduce costs. The construction contract was \u201cexpedited\u201d, leading to delays and cost changes, and critical investigative work on the pool was not undertaken. It found no dedicated community consultation was undertaken between agreeing on the $28m option and pushing ahead with the $57.9m plan. Gibson says the report is \u201ctotally flawed\u201d and claims the researchers did not interview her or then general manager Ken Gouldthorp.   Related: Black line fever: the battle to keep Sydney\u2019s public pools afloat    Recriminations aside, Baker is aiming for a seamless rather than a speedy opening \u2013 despite Forsyth\u2019s bewilderment and the optics ahead of council elections in September. \u201cI find it a horrible burden,\u201d Baker says. Tink looks to federal independent MP Helen Haynes\u2019s anti-pork barrelling bill, introduced to parliament in February, as a welcome, if late, safeguard against another North Sydney pool-style \u201cpolitical folly\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s actually stained us as a community,\u201d Tink says. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to have the North Sydney pool thrown at me in the [federal House of Representatives] chamber as a joke.\u201d    With the massive bill has come the reality that the community will need to share the pool beyond swimming carnivals in an attempt to cover the costs. Charging to host fashion week shows, production companies and private parties \u2013 far from the usual remit of a local pool \u2013 may help to recoup some of the millions over time. \u201cWe have, I think, a community to apologise to,\u201d North Sydney councillor James Spenceley said in February.

The former prime minister Scott Morrison announced funds for the Australian Future Leaders Foundation in the March 2022 budget, after governor general David Hurley first raised the charity with him in 2020.

Hurley and his office have maintained that while they strongly supported the charity, they remained independent of any funding discussions or day-to-day management.

He grilled Hurley\u2019s official secretary, Paul Singer, in Senate estimates and asked for documents that have now been released. Those documents include the minutes of meetings between Hurley, Singer and the foundation\u2019s head, Chris Hartley, as well as the governor general\u2019s office strategy for 2022, which outlines 10 \u201ckey deliverables\u201d for 2022, including celebrating the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee, establishing a policy to reach net carbon zero by 2050 and supporting \u201cthe delivery of the inaugural governor-general\u2019s Australian Future Leaders Program\u201d. The meeting minutes show discussions about the new charity had begun in August 2020, and that Hurley had shared the idea with Morrison in September. The meeting minutes show that on 6 August 2020, Hurley, Hartley and Singer discussed the idea of an \u201cexperiential program to build a cadre of Australian leaders across all sectors who are better connected, more collaborative and impactful\u201d. At that meeting, Hartley proposed Hurley as chair of the board, an idea Hurley declined, saying that while he would \u201clend his support\u201d and \u201cshare the idea with the PM\u201d, he needed to remain independent. At a meeting on 25 September, Hurley told Hartley that \u201che had raised the proposal with the PM, who had expressed interest in the concept\u201d, according to the minutes. By 29 January 2021, Hurley had written to Morrison, who had \u201cexpressed support\u201d.

The meeting also heard that Hurley intended to share the proposals with \u201cHMTQ\u201d, which stands for Her Majesty the Queen, and would note \u201cparallels with HRH Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Commonwealth study conferences\u201d. There were further meetings in July, August, September, November and December on topics including the planned launch of the program. The $18m funding over five years \u2013 with $4m a year pledged after that \u2013 was announced in the March 2022 budget. There were two more meetings before the new Labor government announced in September that the funding had been scrapped. In February this year, Singer noted in a meeting with Hartley that decisions about funding were matters between the government and the foundation, and asked for Hurley\u2019s name to be removed from the name of the program. He followed that up with a letter. \u201cAs you are aware and agreed, notwithstanding the governor-general\u2019s support for the development of [the] program, he cannot become \u2013 and has not ever been \u2013 involved in the day-to-day operations or management of the Australian Future Leaders Foundation.

Singer said that it wasn\u2019t until 7 September 2022 (when the funding was scrapped) that it was \u201cunderstood that the program would not be proceeding in that form\u201d. Shoebridge told Guardian Australia the situation showed a \u201clarge accountability gap\u201d in the governor general\u2019s office. \u201cAny mature office with proper checks and balances would have killed this proposal off before it got started,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for Singer\u2019s office said the governor general was \u201cnot involved in the day-to-day operations of the foundation or its governance\u201d. \u201cIt is on the public record that the governor general spoke with the then prime minister about the national leadership program, the potential national value and his support for the design and development of the initiative,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cNotwithstanding that support, it was always understood and clear that the government of the day was responsible for funding decisions (including whether to and to what quantum).\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted Hartley and Morrison\u2019s office for a response.", "\u2018Where is the accountability?\u2019: Indigenous children bear the brunt of Australia\u2019s unequal education system [2023-07-18T15:00:23Z]": "When schoolteacher April drives past one of the local private schools in Alice Springs, what sticks out are the green, manicured lawns. When she looks out of the window at one of the public secondary schools where she teaches, she sees a brown, weed-choked oval. \u201cIt\u2019s like a metaphor for public education in this town,\u201d says April, who has asked that her real name not be published. \u201cIt\u2019s parched, it\u2019s neglected.\u201d In the decade since the Gonski review into the funding of Australia\u2019s education system, state government funding to public schools in the Northern Territory \u2013 where 39% of the student population is Indigenous \u2013 has fallen by 7.75% in real terms. In Western Australia, it has fallen by 5.6%. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect the area of need,\u201d says Tracy Woodroffe, a Warumungu Luritja woman and an education expert at Charles Darwin University. \u201cIf we\u2019re having standardised assessment, which is what Naplan is, that reports students in more remote areas are performing less [well] than students in urban areas \u2026 where is the accountability in catering, then, for students who have the most need?\u201d   Related: Private school funding increased twice as much as public schools\u2019 in decade after Gonski, data shows    \u201cEducation is a right, so surely students are entitled to the best education that we can provide for them, and not just because they have enough money to pay for it.\u201d April is at pains to stress that the town\u2019s public schools offer benefits that cannot be measured by funding levels or Naplan results. \u201cOur kids have the experience of attending a multicultural school, and mixing and learning with lots of different people,\u201d she says. \u201cFor those that do go on to university, they do very well because they\u2019re able to self-manage and function in flexible and diverse environments.\u201d Teachers in the public system go above and beyond to enable students to reach their potential with the available resources, she says. But that effort cannot entirely compensate for the basic inequity of the system. Schools divided along race lines In their book Waiting for Gonski: How Australia Failed its Schools, Tom Greenwell and Chris Bonnor point to Alice Springs as a glaring example of how funding divides schools by class and race, at the expense of Indigenous students in particular. At the public middle school in Alice Springs, 62% of the 347 enrolled students are Indigenous and 53% speak a language other than English at home. Only 5% of students are in the top quarter of socio-education advantage, and 58% are in the bottom quarter. Socio-education advantage categorises the educational advantage a student brings to their studies based on socioeconomic status and parents\u2019 education. At one of the town\u2019s private schools, which performed well above the public middle school on 2022 Naplan scores for students in year 7 and 8, the demographics are quite different.    At the private school, 80% of the 547 students are non-Indigenous and 16% speak a language other English at home. Almost a third of students are in the top quarter of socio-education advantage, and 15% are in the bottom. The public school receives $31,834 for every student in government funding, compared with $26,848 at the private school, which also gets $9,382 for every student from parent contributions and fees.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But Greenwell says a core recommendation of the Gonski report was to provide additional funding for each Indigenous student, and for schools in regional and remote locations to try to prevent students with a low socio-educational advantage being concentrated in the public education system.  \u201cAre we doing that? No, we\u2019re not,\u201d he says. Nor has the government put in place policies to make private schools more accessible to people who cannot afford fees, he says \u2013 83% of Indigenous student enrolments are in public schools, compared with 65% of non-Indigenous enrolments, according to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (Acara). A system that \u2018reinforces inequality\u2019 The division in Alice Springs is a microcosm of the country. In 158 of the 200 most educationally disadvantaged schools in Australia, the student population is more than 50% Indigenous; in more than half of those 200 schools, the figure is above 90%.  Australia\u2019s schools are the second most segregated along socioeconomic lines in the OECD, with 51% of students who experience socioeconomic disadvantage attending schools with students from a similar background. According to OECD analysis, students experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage who attend schools with advantaged students on average perform the equivalent of three extra years of schooling in science tests. Over the past 20 years, April says, the schools in Alice Springs have increasingly self-segregated as private schools have expanded their facilities and reputation.   Interactive   \u201cThey\u2019re able to attract more middle-class families and then it becomes self-perpetuating \u2013 other families will choose what looks like stability and opportunity for their kids,\u201d she says. Another teacher who worked at an Alice Springs public school until last year, speaking on the condition of anonymity, calls it an \u201capartheid-style\u201d system. \u201cIt\u2019s a system for the haves and a system for the have-nots,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only going to reinforce inequality.\u201d \u2018Engagement isn\u2019t just attendance\u2019 Woodroffe says the funding inequity is exacerbated because Indigenous students are stuck in a system that doesn\u2019t meaningfully engage with them.   Related: The parents fleeing Australia\u2019s public school system \u2013 and those choosing to stay    Teaching and assessment is in standard English, the third or fourth language for many students, and only 2% of teachers are from a First Nations background. \u201cOver time, children within a school get a reputation \u2013 it\u2019s \u2018oh, they don\u2019t come to school, they\u2019re not good learners, they can\u2019t speak good English\u2019\u201d, she says. Woodroffe says efforts to engage students are often misguided plans instigated by non-Indigenous people. She recalls one instance where children in remote areas were collected from their homes and brought to school to try to improve attendance rates. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong point of view because engagement isn\u2019t just attendance. It\u2019s social, it\u2019s emotional, and it\u2019s intellectual engagement, as well as physically being there,\u201d she says. The president of the Northern Territory\u2019s education union, Michelle Ayres, says the problems of disadvantaged schools are made worse because the Territory government, which was contacted for comment, funds its public schools based on attendance rates, rather than on enrolments. \u201cThis completely ignores the fact that it takes more money to engage kids who aren\u2019t attending, not less,\u201d she says. \u201cSo in every sense of the word it is an inequitable funding model, because it takes money away from those who need it the most.\u201d Some are taking it upon themselves to fix the \u201chuge gap\u201d in culturally relevant and accessible education for first peoples.

AimBig Employment is one of 52 for-profit and charity-run employment services providers that have lost market share in the $1bn-a-year program following a performance review. The company was criticised at the royal commission in February, after the inquiry heard it claimed more than $1m in government payments for its \u201cBusyBeans\u201d barista program for people with disability. The program was said to have lacked basic equipment in one case, despite being also funded by a $300,000 government grant. According to documents published by the government on Wednesday, AimBig will lose about 18% of the 106 Des job agency sites it has been running, making it the second-hardest hit provider. The changes are the result of this periodic review, not the royal commission.   Related: Disability services company pocketed nearly $1m for barista course lacking basic equipment, inquiry hears    The worst-hit job agency is AtWork, which will have 19% of its 123 sites closed. It has faced criticism from jobseekers during the rollout of the separate mainstream job services scheme, Workforce Australia. Joblife Employment, Status Employment Services, About2Work, which lost all of its eight sites, and Matchworks were the others to lose the most in market share. Other affected companies to lose a small number of sites included major players Max Employment, the Salvation Army Employment Plus and Sarina Russo. The largest provider, APM, was not affected by the overhaul. About 15,000 jobseekers will be referred to a new provider following the changes, which were first announced at the weekend by the social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, ahead of the government\u2019s jobs summit. The list of affected providers was published on Wednesday and includes eight small providers who have been stripped of all their Des sites. Rishworth said about 6% of disability employment services were \u201cjust not up to scratch\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t think people with a disability deserve that,\u201d she told ABC Radio on Wednesday. \u201cNow I will make the point that there are a lot of good providers that are doing a great job with people with a disability, but it\u2019s not good enough for their reputation to be damaged by poor-quality services.\u201d Because the scheme relies on outsourced providers, most of the $1bn a year allocated in the federal budget to the program is paid to for-profit and charity-run job agencies. They receive service fees for each jobseeker on their books and \u201coutcome\u201d payments for placing people into employment or education. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on how the complex, privatised job services model \u2013 and the accompanying mutual obligations that underpin the system \u2013 can see jobseekers forced through tick-a-box activities, while major providers can profit even when individuals find their own jobs. A secret report commissioned by the former Coalition government and revealed by Guardian Australia showed the cost of the Des scheme had blown out significantly. This had padded the bottom line of providers but the quality of service was poor, the report said. The \u201creallocation\u201d of the business share of each Des job agency happens periodically and is based on a series of indicators, known as \u201cstar ratings\u201d. Both the employment services industry and welfare advocates have previously criticised the \u201cstar ratings\u201d model, with some experts and former consultants saying the ratings can incentivise perverse outcomes, such as funnelling jobseekers into unnecessary education courses.

Bulk billing is when the full cost of a consultation is paid for by Medicare. \nThe data set also shows a separate figure of the total percentage of all GP services delivered in an electorate that were bulk billed. During an appointment, a patient might get one service bulk billed, such as a vaccination, but pay out of pocket for a separate service, such as an extended consult. \nThe rates of GP patients being fully bulk billed are low in affluent, metropolitan electorates such as Warringah and Wentworth in Sydney, as well as the electorate of Canberra. Experts say this likely represents the ability of wealthier communities to pay for visits. \nBut the bulk-billing rate is also low in several less affluent, regional and rural electorates, including Dawson in central Queensland, Eden-Monaro and Shortland in New South Wales, Indi in north-east Victoria, as well as Tasmania\u2019s Franklin, Clark and Bass. \n\u201cThis probably reflects doctor shortage and reduced competitive pressure to bulk bill,\u201d said Charles Maskell-Knight, a health funding analyst and former senior public servant in the health department. \n Interactive \n \nThe problem is particularly pronounced in the Tasmanian electorates of Clark and Franklin, in and near Hobart, where only about 37% of people had all of their GP appointments bulk billed in the 2021-22 financial year, well below the national average. That has dropped from 41% two years earlier. \nYou can find bulk-billing data for your electorate in this map: \n Interactive \n \n\u2018He was sick for months\u2019 \nAs Guardian Australia previously revealed, residents of the Glamorgan-Spring Bay council on Tasmania\u2019s east coast are being charged to prop up bulk-billed GP services as part of their council rates. Yet with a median age of 56 and a high proportion of retirees, many are chronically ill and struggling to make ends meet. The median weekly household income in eastern Tasmania is $854, far short of the national median of $1,438. \nWhen Grant Jenkins from Bichenot on Tasmania\u2019s east coast became ill after being let go from his job in hospitality last year, he avoided going to the doctor because he couldn\u2019t afford the $70 out-of-pocket cost of a visit. He hoped the illness would go away on its own. \n \n  Related: Revealed: more Australians than ever are paying to see a doctor as new data shows worst-hit areas  \n \n\u201cBut he was sick for months, and months and months,\u201d said his wife, Nicole Jenkins. \nJenkins had no choice but to pay for weekly visits on top of blood tests, bringing the total to $130 a week over eight weeks, until he was diagnosed with glandular fever. \nThe couple, who were living off Nicole\u2019s income from contract shift work at the local hotel, were only able to afford the added expense by eating one meal a day. \n\u201cI never let the kids go without but we\u2019d miss breakfast and lunch and have tea,\u201d she said. Her husband was not able to access any bulk-billing GPs because there are none in the area. \nA collective of healthcare practitioners on Tasmania\u2019s east coast has conducted a survey of more than 100 residents. The results, provided to Guardian Australia, found 40% said it was not easy for them to travel to Launceston or Hobart for health appointments. \nAlmost a quarter said it was \u201cnever\u201d easy to see a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, dietician or podiatrist, while 45% said their healthcare provider did not fully understand or even know what other treatments and appointments they were having. \nWhat can be done? \nThe federal government\u2019s Strengthening Medicare taskforce report, published this month, found that a system of GPs working in isolation and delivering episodic care without coordination with other health professionals is failing the most chronically ill. The taskforce recommended a move to team-based, multidisciplinary care. \nA report from thinktank the Grattan Institute, published in December, found most GPs have steady profit margins and that simply increasing Medicare rebates for GPs will not entice them to rural and remote areas or address patchy access to healthcare, nor help with coordination of care among different providers. \n\u201cAustralia has many GPs, with more on the way,\u201d the report said. \u201cAnd general practices have survived the four-year Medicare Benefits Schedule freeze battered but intact, with higher take-home pay and steady profit margins\u201d. \nThe report said other health professionals \u2013 including nurse practitioners, physiotherapists and physician assistants \u2013 should be allowed to bill a broader range of consultations and treatments to Medicare, and that requiring GP approval before Medicare rebates can be applied for consultations by other health professionals is adding to fragmented and delayed care. \nThis type of model did exist nationally in the 1970s, emerging out of the battle for universal healthcare under the Whitlam government. The community health program involved GPs, allied and mental health professionals, and nurses, and it existed in every state and territory. But it was abolished by subsequent governments, and states were left to prop up community healthcare alone. Most absorbed community health services into the acute care system. \n \n  Related: \u2018Bulk billing is almost non-existent\u2019: Tasmanian councils turn to ratepayers to prop up flailing GP clinics   \n \nVictoria was the only state to retain a comprehensive network of 24 community health services across metropolitan and rural areas, funded by a mix of state and federal money. One of the largest, Cohealth, provides \u201cone-stop shop\u201d access to GPs, nurses, dental care, mental health care, homelessness support, alcohol and drug treatment, and allied health services from 30 sites across Melbourne\u2019s city centre, and the northern and western suburbs. \nRichard Di Natale, who is Cohealth\u2019s health policy adviser and a public health doctor and former leader of the Greens, is leading a project to bring this model to east Tasmania. Partnering with councils and GPs, and using funds from a federal government grant, the group will work with the community to establish a health clinic. \nDi Natale said once established the community clinic would be a litmus test for how the federal government manages an increasingly ageing and chronically ill population, and responds to the needs of rural, regional and disadvantaged populations. \n\u201cIt is very clear there is a real appetite to try and build this multidisciplinary, community health model in this community,\u201d Di Natale said. \u201cWhat we want to do is demonstrate just how effective this can be, and eventually expand the model potentially throughout Tasmania and into other states.\u201d \nNot all states are struggling \nTasmania stands out as a particularly tough state to find affordable care. Maskell-Knight said the data showed overall there were 40 electorates throughout Australia where more than three-quarters of the population were bulk billed for all their GP visits in 2021-22, with many of these in the most populous states. \nNSW is home to nine of the top 10 electorates for bulk billing. These include Blaxland, Chifley, Fowler and Werriwa, where more than 96% of patients always had their GP appointments bulk-billed. \nYou can search the data to see the rates for your area here: \n Interactive \n \nMaskell-Knight said the figures showed it was \u201cstill possible to offer a high level of bulk billing while maintaining a viable practice\u201d. \n\u201cThis calls into question demands from some doctor groups for a doubling of the Medicare benefits schedule rebate to restore the viability of general practice,\u201d he said. \n\u201cSuch a policy change would cost billions of dollars, much of which would flow to doctors who are already bulk billing most of their patients. \n\u201cBut there are other options than GP-led care, and just paying more money to GPs to encourage GPs to bulk bill.\u201d \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nBut Bruce Willett, the vice-president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, who has been working at his practice in south-east Queensland for almost three decades, said many GPs were paying a \u201ccompassion tax\u201d by continuing to bulk bill. He said he maintains \u201crelatively high bulk billing rates\u201d. \n\u201cI could decide not to bulk bill any of my patients and I would still be fully booked,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a four to six week waiting list, which is not something I enjoy as some patients are dealing with chronic health issues. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have that kind of waiting time and continue to offer a discounted service unless you really care about your patients. It\u2019s not a market-driven decision to keep bulk billing at all \u2013 it\u2019s driven by the care I have for patients I\u2019ve been seeing for 20 to 30 years.\u201d \nWillett said reforms were sorely needed, including lifting Medicare rebates so that doctors get more back from the government for bulk billing their patients. Any moves towards integrated community healthcare had to be \u201cbuilt around GP practices\u201d, he said. \n\u201cIn the UK, there has been too much priority placed on access to care rather than continuity of care, and there are lots of complaints now being made about how impossible it is to see a GP there, and about how you\u2019re referred to a pharmacist or nurse instead,\u201d Willett said. \n\u201cPeople really want to see their GP for the continuity of care, and if people are seeing a number of different people and practitioners, it leads to duplication and confusion.\u201d \n \n How has bulk billing changed in your area?

Taxpayer funding to the Urannah project has been described as \u201cbrazenly political\u201d and was announced before the National Water Grid advisory body, now disbanded, had been able to scrutinise a detailed business case. The proponent\u2019s business case has since been released, prompting concerns about the economic return on investment. It said that over 30 years, local communities would obtain 95c of economic benefit from every dollar spent. Supporting studies show the stated economic benefit is underpinned by assumptions that more water would support the intensification of coalmining \u2013 and the development of new mines \u2013 in the Queensland Bowen basin. The studies use assumptions from a 2018 report for the mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, including predictions that metallurgical coal exports would grow by 113m tonnes, or \u201cthe equivalent of a large export mine being added to the market every year to 2030\u201d. As a result, the Urannah business case assumes a growth in mining \u2013 and associated water demand \u2013 until 2049. Tim Buckley, an energy market analyst, said the assumption was \u201cludicrous\u201d and the market demand for metallurgical coal would, according to a modelling by the International Energy Agency, likely decrease by 57% over the longer term. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more dams for coking coal, we need enabling investment to catalyse the new massive zero-emissions industries of the future, where the job opportunities are literally in the hundreds of billions of dollars a year,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cWhy are we planning on building more stranded assets rather than building more assets of the future?\u201d   Related: Companies linked to Urannah Dam project donate more than $150,000 to Liberal National party    When the proponent, Bowen River Utilities, conducted \u201cmarket sounding\u201d for the Urannah project by talking to potential water customers, it spoke to 13 potential industrial users \u2013 all coalmines in the Bowen Basin. The Urannah business case predicts $555m of new economic benefit in the mining sector as a result of the dam project and an additional $727m from agriculture. Guardian Australia reported on Thursday that companies linked to Urannah project had donated more than $150,000 to the Queensland Liberal National party, and that the wife of the federal MP Julian Simmonds is working for the proponent as its communications manager. A spokesperson for Bowen River Utilities said John Cotter Jr, the sole director of the company, \u201chas made donations to both the ALP and the LNP, all of which have been publicly declared (with) the Electoral Commission Queensland and Australian Electoral Commission\u201d.

Conservation groups said the extent to which the project was designed to facilitate the expansion of Queensland coalmining meant it could be used to campaign against inner-city Liberals \u2013 including Simmonds, who represents the green-tinged west Brisbane electorate of Ryan. Simmonds has been contacted for comment. Dave Copeman, the head of the Queensland Conservation Council, said connections between the LNP and destructive projects \u201cdemonstrates yet again that the party has a serious credibility problem when it asks voters to take it seriously as taking action on climate\u201d When the federal government announced funding ahead of the federal budget, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the project would \u201cprovide a secure and affordable water supply for mining, industrial and urban use\u201d. Bowen River Utilities did not respond to a specific offer to comment about the extent to which the project relied upon the expansion of coalmining.

As the anniversary of the disaster approaches, along with the cyclone season, for those left in the flood\u2019s wake the impact is still unfolding.  When the flood waters receded a year ago, for many, the disaster was only beginning. \u201cYou could hazard a guess that something like 15 to 20,000 people were impacted,\u201d says Professor James Bennett Levy from the University of Sydney Centre for Rural Health. \u201cI would say there\u2019s been huge collective trauma as well as individual trauma.\u201d \u201cIf I am doing a community event,\u201d says Naomi Vaotuua, recovery and resilience officer for the Red Cross, \u201cI will literally have grown men crying in my arms because it\u2019s a cloudy day and they thought they were doing alright but they have been triggered.\u201d    Kerry Pritchard, coordinator of recovery Hub 2484 in Murwillumbah, says: \u201cI guess what is surfacing now is more residual complex trauma. We feel like we are still very much in the middle of it, at the coalface of supporting people. That is both in terms of rebuilding in a physical sense and also healing from that traumatic event.\u201d The northern rivers floods were Australia\u2019s biggest natural disaster since Cyclone Tracy in 1974. It was the second-costliest event in the world for insurers in 2022, and the most expensive disaster in Australian history. Many residents had found premiums unaffordable and had no insurance at all. The Northern Rivers Reconstruction Corporation (NRRC), funded by the federal and NSW governments, is currently assessing over 6,000 flood-impacted residences for buyback, raising or retrofit.    A survey released this month by Southern Cross University revealed that nine months after the event, at the end of 2022, almost 52% of flood victims were living in the shells of homes that had flooded; 26% were living in temporary accommodation such as caravans, sheds or pods, or with friends or family; 18% were living in insecure accommodation such as tents or temporary rentals; and 4% were no longer living in the region.  The departure of thousands of locals is one of the things that broke the heart of city councillor and executive director of Resilient Lismore, Elly Bird. \u201cThey are disconnected from their community and the people they went through that experience with and disconnected from our recovery journey and support. They are probably having a hard time,\u201d Bird says. Hanabeth Luke, senior lecturer in science and engineering at Southern Cross University, and one of the researchers behind the survey, said she was \u201cshocked to see the low, low levels of mental health. Twenty percent of people said they were coping with the stresses and challenges of recovery and 60% said they were not coping.\u201d    It is the housing uncertainty  causing mental health strain, Luke says; the stress of \u201cnot being able to move forward, making do without a clear plan\u201d. People live in substandard dwellings while they wait on government assessments or insurance payouts, not knowing whether to fix a house or if they might get a buyback. People camp out in caravans outside dilapidated abandoned houses, houses they are still paying mortgages and rates for. Families squeeze into a single motel room where they are not allowed to cook or have their pets. Up until last month, the Koori Kitchen was still serving around around 700 free meals a day at Browns Creek car park in Lismore, says Koori Mail general manager Naomi Moran. It was forced to close as the council wanted the car spaces back to help support local business recovery. These things take their toll.    60%  said they were not coping  Hanabeth Luke, Southern Cross University     \u201cWhat has been found is that the more you were likely to have been scared of injury or death, the higher the likelihood of PTSD,\u201d says Bennett Levy. \u201cSimilarly, the more extensive the inundation the more likelihood of significant mental health issues. If we go back to the data we can say that the people who are displaced from home for more than six months are at very high risk of PTSD.\u201d  Pritchard sees the data borne out in real life. \u201cA year out and people are just worn down, they\u2019re exhausted, they\u2019re losing hope and just can\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel. We\u2019re seeing a lot of suicidal ideation.\u201d People who have always worked hard and supported themselves find themselves having to ask for help, she says. \u201cThere are a lot of feelings of shame and impotency around that.\u201d Those who could afford insurance are now coming to the end of the 52 weeks of temporary accommodation paid for by their insurers. For those locals, there is anxiety about whether they will get into the 11 pod villages built by Resilience NSW across the region. The villages aim to house 1,800 people for up to three years. Another 300 people are still in emergency accommodation.    \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a whole other cohort of people at risk of homelessness like we\u2019ve never really seen before,\u201d says Vaotuua. Kim Shelley, manager of recovery support services at the Mullumbimby &amp; District Neighbourhood Centre, says there has been a \u201chuge increase\u201d in domestic violence since the floods. \u201cThe growing concern for some of the women is that they are staying in relationships because of no alternative accommodation in the area,\u201d Shelley says.  *** Chris Trew first spoke to the Guardian in those shellshocked days after the flood last year. For five nights, Chris, his wife and two children, three dogs, two cats and a snake slept in two cars.    Several weeks after the flood they got back into the house, \u201cbasically because we [had] nowhere else to go\u201d, Chris says. \u201cWe got the shower just about going and the toilet. But no kitchen, no ceilings, no electric. It was very difficult. Every time the wind blew we got covered in dust. So we bought a camper van and lived in that on the driveway until we got one room with windows sorted and temporary extension leads. But they were only 30 amp, so we kept blowing the fuse all the time. You get the kettle on and the microwave and it might pop. You can\u2019t run heaters off it.\u201d And then Chris got a serious spinal injury. \u201cI was in incredible pain, I was absolutely shot to bits.\u201d He is waiting on an operation and wincing in pain as he speaks.  Two weeks ago he was visited by the NRRC assessors. There is for Chris Trew a fragile hope. He is waiting on final confirmation for buyback. \u201cThey reckon we are all go,\u201d he says.  But, he adds, \u201cSo many people are in strife. People\u2019s mental health is not that great. I know of two people who have committed suicide recently.\u201d    Standing outside her trashed house in gumboots in the days after the flood, Gemma Martin was stoic when she talked to the Guardian, joking even. It had been such a pretty house. But in the year since, the stoicism has been tested. \u201cI sort of went into it with a heightened sort of survival mode thing and then crashed later on.\u201d  Bennett Levy explains: \u201cIn the first six months people are very activated and focused to see if they can recover their houses. There are basic security issues in the first few months \u2013 food, accommodation, money. Between six months and the longer term PTSD issues come to the fore and they recognise that they are having all kinds of anxiety symptoms.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Martin\u2019s relationship with the father of her children broke down after the flood. He moved back into their house while she was able to rent a granny flat from friends. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford to pay two rents and a mortgage.\u201d  She received an insurance payout in December and bought a caravan to put in the backyard \u201cso that the kids don\u2019t have to sleep inside because they were getting sick staying with their dad, infections, sinus infections.\u201d    Like many others, she lies awake at night and worries: \u201cWhat if I did this, or what if we did that?\u201d Martin says.  \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t know how much to fix my house because if it\u2019s going to get bulldozed in a couple of years then I\u2019m not going to put too much effort in, but I have to make it safe. If they [the NRRC] just reached out and said they were still working on their system and they might have an answer by March or whatever, it would be OK, I wouldn\u2019t be looking into the great abyss.\u201d The frustration and need is evident. Facing these concurrent crises, the government response for many feels too long and too far away. However, Tony Davis, CEO of the nonprofit Social Futures, says: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that the government has really committed to resourcing recovery and to getting measures in place because they didn\u2019t in [the floods] of 2017. We can see there\u2019s resourcing now but unfortunately it\u2019s still not coming close to meeting the need.\u201d *** At Chinderah, south of Tweed Heads, eight of the 14 caravan parks were wiped out when the Tweed River broke its banks on 28 February. The majority of the residents were pensioners over 60, and less than a quarter of them were insured.  \u201cYou are talking about people who were already vulnerable and they are forgotten people. They are all elderly, struggling with PTSD and don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d says Kay Redman, a volunteer at the community hub. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people living in their cars that are just homeless.\u201d     Andrea Grogan, 59, has finally got her slab replaced, and her new home \u2013 an expanding shipping container \u2013 has just been delivered. She was not insured and it was the cheapest dwelling she could find. Even then she still had to buy a trailer to put it on. She got a $20,000 government grant and has borrowed money from family. Up until December she lived in her old 1970s caravan, which had been condemned after the flooding. \u201cIt had mould. I had a four-pronged power pack and I could run a little bar fridge, a light and a kettle or toaster but I couldn\u2019t do more than that because it tripped my power,\u201d Grogan says. When it was demolished in December, Grogan was able rent a cabin in the park while she waited for the container home to arrive. \u201cAt the moment I am paying rent on the cabin as well as on my site which is basically the whole of my pension.\u201d She is concerned about other residents. There is shoddy work being done on people\u2019s homes, she claims. \u201cIt just really takes its toll. We have already been battered from losing everything and a lot of people just aren\u2019t able to get up and fight.\u201d In the shimmering beauty of a northern rivers afternoon, empty husks of houses stand with their lawns neatly mowed, caravan and tents outside.     It is the strength of these communities that will prevail.  The community hubs that were formed when people came together as water poured through their towns. Who reached out to each other and showed the absolute best of humanity. And who a year later are needed more than ever. On a January day of steamy inland swamp heat in Lismore, Elly Bird says: \u201cWe get people in here looking for all sorts of help. We see the whole spectrum in all its complexity.\u201d", "\u2018Industrial revolution\u2019: Australia\u2019s decarbonisation needs rigorous management, thinktank warns [2022-07-03T17:30:20Z]": "Australia\u2019s biggest polluters need a rigorous emissions reduction regime that avoids exemptions for trade-exposed industries, according to the Grattan Institute, which says decarbonising Australian industry is an \u201cIndustrial Revolution against a deadline\u201d. In a new policy paper released on Monday, Tony Wood, the paper\u2019s lead author, says that the \u201cnext Industrial Revolution\u201d for the sector will require the government to implement a range of policies to work towards the net zero by 2050 target while avoiding political opposition and social friction. \u201cThe scale and pace of change required to achieve net zero by 2050 is unprecedented,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIf managed poorly, it will generate social opposition and political friction, which in turn will mean Australia does not capture the large potential benefits of the transition.\u201d Call for focus on industrial polluters The report focuses on the need to decarbonise heavy manufacturing and mining, which produce a third of Australia\u2019s carbon emissions. About 80% of industrial emissions are produced by 213 big industrial facilities in Australia. Government data released last week showed greenhouse gas emissions from heavy industry had risen 25.5% since 2005, largely due to an increase in liquified natural gas exports. Key among the report\u2019s recommendations are for a revamped safeguard mechanism which would set a limit on carbon emissions for the country\u2019s biggest polluters.   Related: Australian company secures $700,000 deal for carbon capture and storage machine    While the Albanese government has committed to reviving the Abbott-era safeguard mechanism to reduce emissions by 5m tonnes each year, it is yet to outline exactly how it will achieve this. The model proposed by the Grattan Institute urges the government to allow the trading of carbon credits, saying this would give access to the most economic emissions reductions and \u201callows for greater ambition\u201d. In a recommendation already being resisted by some industrial polluters, the report also urges the government not to exempt or shield trade-exposed industries from complying with the new safeguard mechanism, saying it could ultimately increase costs and \u201cpush effort on to other sectors of the economy such as agriculture and households\u201d. \u201cIf the government wants to provide assistance with structural adjustment, this should be done outside the Safeguard \u2013 for example, through the National Reconstruction Fund,\u201d the report states. The report also advocates for the mechanism to have stricter thresholds for new entrants and to continually revise down the emissions limit as companies improved their performance. It currently applies to companies producing more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon emissions annually.

Wood also finds that many government programs and policies may \u201cinadvertently\u201d be pushing emissions up because they were designed before the commitment to net zero was made. \u201cBeginning with their largest programs, governments should immediately begin reviewing policies that assist the industrial sector and where necessary redesign them to avoid locking in higher-emissions processes and practices.\u201d Fossil fuel subsidies \u2018inefficient and wasteful\u2019 In a similar vein, the paper is also critical of existing subsidies for fossil fuels and heavy-polluting industries. As examples, the report highlights the $7.5m government grant to the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory to confirm the size of the gas reserve, and funding through the Northern Australia infrastructure facility for the Olive Downs coalmine in Queensland that will add 609,000 tonnes to national emissions each year. The $175m Naif loan amounts to subsidising the production of emissions at $8.18 a tonne \u2013 as the government simultaneously underwrites emissions reductions at $17.35 a tonne through the Emissions Reduction Fund, a decision the paper labels \u201cinefficient and wasteful of public money and private capital\u201d.   Related: Former Australian chief scientist to head review of carbon credit scheme after whistleblower revelations     It says that Australian governments have a \u201csorry track record of propping up uneconomic facilities in regional areas, and justifying this on employment grounds\u201d. For example, the owners of the Mount Isa copper smelter in western Queensland received more than $100m in subsidies after threatening to close in 2011, 2016 and 2020, \u201ctimed with the Queensland election cycle\u201d. \u201cGovernments need to be much better informed about which facilities have a future and which don\u2019t, and clear-eyed about whether facilities in distress are worth saving,\u201d the report says. Delicate handling required The report says that if the government does not manage the coming Industrial Revolution well, Australia\u2019s \u201csocial fabric could tear\u201d, especially in the regions of NSW and Queensland where tens of thousands of coal-mining jobs will disappear between now and 2050. \u201cCoal and gas will inevitably decline, which is frightening for people who rely on those industries for a living and challenging for governments that rely heavily on those sectors for economic growth,\u201d Wood says. \u201cBut if government and industry can forge a new strategic partnership, Australia will be able to create jobs and boost prosperity in a net zero world by building export-oriented industries based on our vast renewable energy and mineral resources.\u201d It proposes using coal mining royalties collected by state governments to prepare communities for the looming transition, advocating a \u201clocally driven, bottom-up\u201d approach, along with new regional transition authorities. The report also suggests that the government consider a windfall profit tax on coal and gas exports to help fund the transition. \u201cThe federal government seems unlikely to fix the petroleum resource rent tax, which is poorly structured and provides almost no revenue. However, at times of extreme international prices, it should consider a windfall profit tax on gas and coal exports above a fair return. It suggests the government could also establish an \u201cindustrial transformation future fund\u201d to share the risk of major capital replacements using low- or zero-emissions technology, and provide funding to industries that can flourish in a net zero global economy. \u201cAustralia must embrace the challenges and grasp the opportunities of the global net zero revolution, because the consequences of failure are too ugly to contemplate and the benefits of success are too great to ignore,\u201d Wood said.", "Barista course lacking basic equipment set up with $300,000 federal grant, disability inquiry hears [2022-02-24T08:02:07Z]": "A barista course aimed at people with disability that allegedly lacked basic equipment and had no specific training manuals was established using a $300,000 federal government grant, an inquiry has heard. \nGuardian Australia reported on Wednesday that the Busy Beans program, run by disability employment services provider AimBig, was facing claims aired at the disability royal commission that it had \u201cno established policies, procedures, safety measures or proper facilities to train the participants\u201d. \nThe program is the main case study of three-day hearings this week examining the troubled $1bn-a-year disability employment services program. \nThe royal commission heard on Thursday that on top of $874,000 in government payments for putting jobseekers through the training, the program was also funded using a grant from the National Disability Insurance Agency worth \u201cin excess of $300,000\u201d. \n \n  Related: Disability services company pocketed nearly $1m for barista course lacking basic equipment, inquiry hears  \n \nGuardian Australia can reveal grant documents show $313,769.50 was awarded in 2019 to Rehab Management, which shares a holding company with AimBig. \nUnder the Busy Beans model, people with disability \u2013 who were either paid in part using about $100,000 in government wage subsidies or were unpaid interns \u2013 learned to make coffee by serving as in-house baristas for workers at AimBig and Rehab Management offices or other external businesses. \nPeople on the autism spectrum or with \u201cmoderate intellectual disabilities\u201d were to \u201creceive barista, job readiness and customer service training delivered by qualified barista trainers at \u2018coffee schools\u2019 across Australia\u201d. \nAn AimBig manager, Matthew Ting, who was responsible for introducing the Busy Beans program, was asked about photos from one of the several \u201ccoffee schools\u201d run out of a Rehab Management office. \nThe photos showed the site of a Rehab Management office with two \u201chome\u201d-style coffee machines laid on office desks in the corner of an office floor. \n\u201cIt boggles my mind why that was set up like that and who did that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand a reason for that.\u201d \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nMzia*, a woman with ADHD who was employed as a Busy Beans barista trainer, claimed on Wednesday that she arrived on her first day to find there was not even a coffee jug, or \u201cproper milks\u201d. \nTrainees had to carry a bucket of hot water across the office to the kitchenette because there was no sink near the \u201cbarista training\u201d area, the inquiry was told. \nTing said he had never visited the site where Mzia had worked and described the environment as \u201cnot at all suitable\u201d. \nTing claimed Mzia was \u201cresponsible\u201d for the coffee school set-up, though he acknowledged responsibility also lay with her managers.

This process resulted in 96 per cent of funds allocated to Coalition state seats.\u201d The report found the only records kept of the approved grants made to 22 councils were found in a series of emails from the staff of both Berejiklian and Barilaro. That was interpreted in a briefing note to Berejiklian as councils that \u201cdid not take legal action against us\u201d. The audit found Berejiklian personally identified 41 projects for funding, valued at $142m while Barilaro selected 188 projects totalling $61m.

We\u2019ve ridden the cash flow ups and downs that all small businesses do. We\u2019ve adjusted our stroke as tourists flood in and flood back out again. We dived under the first pandemic wave in 2020, emerging stronger and more resilient after 11 weeks of lockdown, thanks to the federal government\u2019s cash boost and jobkeeper programs, and higher spending by optimistic guests. And now our prime minister has told us to ride the Omicron wave, a catastrophic dumper created by state and federal governments that can\u2019t be ridden by small business. We\u2019ve closed our restaurant. Forever.   Related: \u2018Extreme stress\u2019: Australian businesses risk going under due to impact of Omicron    My business partner, Paul Holmes, who opened the restaurant more than six years ago, is a restaurateur with 40 years\u2019 experience. He has turned around countless floundering restaurants for others, traded through recessions and run his own successful restaurants. But he couldn\u2019t save this business. No one could have. Our regulars came back in droves after the first lockdown. They supported local businesses, including ours. We had our best winter trading since we opened. But the closure of the \u201cPineapple Curtain\u201d (the Queensland border), although popular with the state\u2019s voters, has had the longer-term disastrous effect of vaccine hesitancy within the cloistered population. Post-jobkeeper lockdowns during the pandemic exposed the already high-level career insecurity in the hospitality industry, and then supercharged it. Our small business lost qualified and experienced chefs to mining, manufacturing, warehousing management and the food service industry \u2013 not to other restaurants. They wanted to be able to pay their mortgages and keep their jobs through lockdowns. When our head chef left for personal reasons on 12 September last year, we had to close our restaurant and let all our other staff go as we hadn\u2019t been able to find a suitably experienced chef to replace him. By then, we\u2019d already been looking for three months. We took another three months to find a fantastic head chef and a second chef who were pivotal in the rebuilding of our team. We nervously reopened on 10 December. During this search for a chef, there was an online pile-on by anti-vaxxers when we replied \u201cIt is the law\u201d to an enquiry asking if the chef had to be vaccinated. We also had a surprising number of applications from people who had \u201cdone some cooking at a cafe for 12 months\u201d and an unsurprising number of applications from chefs living abroad \u2013 outside our closed national borders. We\u2019d used a welcome Queensland government grant to fund the increased wages necessary to secure these key staff members and to partially restock the restaurant. Paul had worked with the chef to create a smaller menu to help manage costs. He felt that we\u2019d have to absorb the increase in the price of fresh produce, especially meat and fish, over the last 12 months. Spending per head had dropped noticeably on our return and although locals were pleased the border had opened, they were now nervous about catching Covid. You have to have a certain amount of good luck when running a small business. Some people say you make your own luck. They might be right. But the timing of the bad luck we had on the night we reopened was the beginning of the end. The kitchen\u2019s exhaust fan motor seized that first night, making the temperature in our kitchen about 50C. We\u2019d already limited guest bookings by half to just 25 people to allow our new kitchen team to cope with working together with a new menu in a new environment.   Related: As the election draws closer, Scott Morrison is caught in a Covid dilemma of his own making | Richard Denniss    In a Christmas miracle, we located a great air-conditioning mechanic who could diagnose the problem and replace the unit or repair the motor. Replacement would take until February due to international shipping delays (Covid) or he could retrofit a different unit by Christmas. We chose the latter. Unfortunately, the unit got caught up in trucking delays from Melbourne (Covid) and the new motor seized eight minutes after it was installed in late December, due to damage acquired from poor packing prior to transport (possibly not Covid). Our chefs worked for three weeks in great discomfort. The final nail in our coffin was hammered in on 7 January when the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, urged people to work from home if they were able and avoid socialising for the next six weeks. Cancellations went through the roof and bookings through the floor. You can\u2019t run a restaurant in a ghost town. When one of our staff was declared a close contact of someone with Covid last Friday, we decided to decline the offer of the federal government to allow us to trade insolvent and have closed our once-$1m-turnover business. Thankfully, we\u2019re walking away with no debt. Our landlord deserves special mention. He rang us before the first lockdown in 2020 and offered us a two-month rent holiday before any government had offered small business any support. And he has worked with us on making our rent affordable during the whole pandemic. He has been compassionate and generous throughout. The poor planning and poll-driven decisions by governments has defeated us. An economy \u2013 the real one that you\u2019ll find in main streets, shopping centres and in tourist towns \u2013 collapses when citizens are too afraid to leave their homes and when small businesses all over the country close.

The flight left shortly after 10.30pm local time (11.30am GMT). \nHawke had cancelled the visa on Friday on the basis Djokovic\u2019s presence in Australia might risk \u201ccivil unrest\u201d as he is a \u201ctalisman of anti-vaccination sentiment\u201d. And on Sunday, Chief Justice James Allsop announced the court unanimously dismissed Djokovic\u2019s application, with costs to be paid by the tennis star. \nAllsop explained the decision of the court did not reflect on \u201cthe merits or wisdom of the decision\u201d but rather whether it was so irrational as to be unlawful. Full reasons will follow at a later date. \n \n  Related: Imagine if Australia applied its new no-dickhead policy on Novak Djokovic to government troublemakers  \n \nThe decision is a major setback for Djokovic\u2019s quest to win a 10th Australian Open crown and a record 21st grand slam title. \nIn a statement Djokovic said he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d with the ruling, acknowledging it meant he \u201ccannot stay in Australia and participate in the Australian Open\u201d. \n\u201cI respect the court\u2019s ruling and I will cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI am uncomfortable that the focus of the past weeks has been on me and I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love. \n\u201cI would like to wish the players, tournament officials, staff, volunteers and fans all the best for the tournament.\u201d \nDjokovic said he intended to take some time to \u201crest and recuperate\u201d before making any further comment. \nSerbia\u2019s prime minister on Sunday criticised the decision to cancel the visa as \u201cscandalous\u201d.  \nAna Brnabic told reporters in Belgrade: \u201cI think the court decision is scandalous...I find it unbelievable that we have two completely contradictory court decisions within the span of just a few days. \n\u201cI am disappointed...I think it demonstrated how the rule of law is functioning or better to say not functioning in some other countries. In any case, I can hardly wait to see Novak Djokovic in our own country, in Serbia.\u201d \nDjokovic\u2019s lawyers had argued Hawke\u2019s decision was \u201cillogical, irrational or unreasonable\u201d and the minister based it on Djokovic\u2019s public statements about vaccination without actually seeking his views. \nThe ATP called the saga \u201ca deeply regrettable series of events.\u201d A statement added: \u201cUltimately, decisions of legal authorities regarding matters of public health must be respected. More time is required to take stock of the facts and to take the learnings from this situation. \n\u201cIrrespective of how this point has been reached, Novak is one of our sport\u2019s greatest champions and his absence from the Australian Open is a loss for the game. We know how turbulent the recent days have been for Novak and how much he wanted to defend his title in Melbourne. We wish him well and look forward to seeing him back on court soon.

He believed that a visa granted on 18 November and a medical exemption approved by Tennis Australia and a Victorian government independent expert panel would be sufficient to enter Australia. \nDjokovic\u2019s visa was first cancelled by Australian Border Force hours after he arrived at Melbourne airport and he was taken to a detention hotel.  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nOn Monday a federal circuit court judge restored Djokovic\u2019s visa, concluding it was unreasonable for the ABF to renege on a deal to give him more time at the airport to address the exemption issue. \nAfter a week\u2019s deliberation, Hawke cancelled Djokovic\u2019s visa again on Friday on the new ground that his presence might be a risk to \u201chealth and good order\u201d. \nIn a statement, Hawke welcomed the unanimous decision, arguing that Australia\u2019s \u201cstrong border protection policies\u201d had both \u201ckept us safe during the pandemic\u201d and \u201care fundamental to safeguarding Australia\u2019s social cohesion\u201d. \n \n  Related: The Djokovic circus allows us to see all our Covid prejudices being played out | Emma John  \n \n\u201cAustralians have made great sacrifices to get to this point [in the pandemic] and the Morrison government is firmly committed to protecting this position, as the Australian people expect.\u201d \nThe Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, welcomed \u201cthe decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s now time to get on with the Australian Open and get back to enjoying tennis over the summer.\u201d \nReaction in Australia to the court result was mixed.

Before we go, let\u2019s recap the big headlines: \n   \n   The prime minister, Anthony Albanese marked the final day of an Asean summit in Melbourne by announcing $61.5m for a range of initiatives designed to strengthen ties with south-east Asian nations. \n   The PM said \u201cremains concerned\u201d about humanitarian situation in Gaza and that Australia would \u201cmake an assessment\u201d on UNRWA funding. \n   Australia\u2019s economy expanded 0.2% in the final quarter of 2023, with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, saying \u201ceven weak growth is welcome growth\u201d. \n   Optus has been slapped with a $1.5m fine by the communications watchdog after the telco was found to have breached public safety rules. \n   The Greens released their latest housing policy, proposing to create a public property developer to build 360,000 homes over five years. \n   Qantas fined $250,000 for standing down worker who raised Covid concerns. \n   Two climate protesters are in jail for blocking traffic lanes on a major Melbourne freeway, causing significant rush-hour delays. \n   Victoria\u2019s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the government will not be releasing the Ken Lay report into a second safe injecting room for the CBD. \n   The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has significantly reduced the size of Australia\u2019s third offshore wind zone after lobbying from environmental groups. \n   A man has died from a possible hit-and-run incident after his body was found lying on a suburban Sydney street early in the morning. \n   A search is under way for a hiker missing in bushland on Queensland\u2019s highest mountain. \n   The sentencing of former army lawyer David McBride has been postponed at the last minute after the commonwealth attempted to introduce further evidence. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.39am GMT \n \n \n  6.18am GMT  \n  \n  Albanese says Keating \u2018doesn\u2019t need advice\u2019 from him after ex-PM\u2019s comments on foreign minister \n  Let\u2019s return to one point from Anthony Albanese\u2019s post-Asean press conference: his defence of his foreign minister after fresh criticism from Labor luminary Paul Keating. \n  In a statement on Tuesday, Keating said: \n   \n   It doesn\u2019t take much to encourage Penny Wong, sporting her \u2018deeply concerned\u2019 frown, to rattle the China can \u2013 a can she gave a good shake to [on Monday]. \n   \n  That was a reference to a speech on Monday in which Wong raised concerns about destabilising and dangerous actions in the South China Sea. Keating said the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, had \u201cdropped a huge rock into Wong\u2019s pond by telling Australia not to piggyback Australia\u2019s problems with China on to Asean\u201d. \n  Albanese said he did not believe Keating\u2019s comments detracted from the work the Australian government was doing at the special summit with Asean leaders in Melbourne, which wrapped up this afternoon: \n   \n   No, in a word, and Penny Wong will be regarded as one of Australia\u2019s finest foreign ministers since federation. Penny Wong is someone who brings Australia enormous respect, enormous respect \u2013 she\u2019s someone who is diligent, she\u2019s someone who is engaging, she\u2019s someone who is across of all of her briefs and she\u2019s someone who represents Australia in a way in which every Australian can be proud. \n   \n  Asked whether Keating should stop the personalised language against Wong, Albanese said: \n   \n   I know Paul and respect him. Paul, I think, doesn\u2019t need advice off myself. It is up to him, but people are accountable for what they say. Paul is accountable for what he says. He knows that.

His file contained complaints of serious criminal and other misconduct which, apart from raising questions as to why he was not prosecuted, cast doubt on the integrity of CSNSW\u2019s employment process. Whether corruption or incompetence (it must have been one or the other) was responsible for his acceptance by CSNSW, I cannot say. It has led to tragic consequences for both prisoners and prison officers. \n   \n  The state government released McClellan\u2019s scathing 800-page report on Wednesday after months of hearings.

He was asked if he was able to convince Asean leaders to keep that reference in the final declaration this time: \n   \n   You will see these declarations are worked out by a whole team of foreign ministers and others. Can I say that we were able to reach a consensus across a full range of issues, so people have to compromise because in order to get a statement from Australia and Asean, it isn\u2019t the same endpoint that any one country would have if they went away and wrote a statement. \n   It was very clear, the position that was put very clearly by President Marcos, but others as well. The South China Sea is an important issue and there is a general recognition that we need to make sure that activity in the South China Sea alleviates any tension and doesn\u2019t add to it.

It is different from, of course they will work with our embassies and high commissions in the different locations. \n   They will work with the landing pad that we\u2019ve established and our dealmaking teams that are also part of the recommendation of Nicholas Moore.

It is dangerous and it creates risks of miscalculation, which can then lead to escalation, so we would call upon a number of nations emphasised in the statements the foundation document is the UN convention on the law of the sea.

And the south-east Asia economic strategy is our blueprint for doing just that. That is why I announced yesterday that Australia is establishing a $2 billion south-east Asia investment financing facility to catalyse greater Australian investment in south-east Asia. \n   Through this facility, our government is saying to Australian companies that we want them to invest in south-east Asia for the health of their own businesses and the broader Australian economy. \n   And here\u2019s how we are going to help.

I also announced yesterday that we will establish new regional landing pads in Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta. \n   These will help open up important business for Australia\u2019s tech enterprises as the digital economy in south-east Asia is projected to be worth up to $1tn by 2030. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.58am GMT \n \n \n  4.41am GMT  \n  \n  Australia improving visa access to Asean countries \u2018to show that Australia is open for business\u2019, Albanese says \n  The prime minister has continued speaking at Asean, where he has addressed how he thinks Australia can continue building its relationships in the region: \n   \n   We can do more, and we can do it better to lift our two-way trade and investment relationship, and to make it easier for our people to engage with each other. \n   That is why we\u2019re improving access to long-validity visas for south-east Asian travellers, to show that Australia is open for business, tourism and trade. \n   We are also implementing other key recommendations of our south-east Asia economic strategy to 2040. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.45am GMT \n \n \n  4.37am GMT  \n  \n  Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day\u2019s news. \n  \n \n \n  4.35am GMT  \n  \n  Anthony Albanese speaking at Asean Melbourne summit \n  Anthony Albanese is speaking at Asean now. He\u2019s opened his remarks by thanking the dignitaries who have participated in the talks. Here\u2019s a taster: \n   \n   Together, we achieved a great deal of agreement today. All of it built on a shared understanding that the Asean-Australia partnership has never been stronger or more important to the peace, stability, and prosperity of our region. \n   Asean itself is a powerful force for regional stability because, as all of us acknowledge, peace is the essential precondition for prosperity. For our region to flourish and for our people to succeed into the future, we must continue to preserve that peace and security through the rules and rights that uphold the sovereignty of all nations and the dignity of every individual. \n   My government is focused on ensuring that the partnership between Australia and Asean can shape the future of our region. We understand this is not just about deepening engagement between governments \u2013 it\u2019s about strengthening and diversifying the business and trade and education connections which have played a central role in the economic transformation of our region. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.40am GMT \n \n \n  4.11am GMT  \n  \n  NSW police confirm incident in Sydney CBD \n  NSW police have confirmed that an incident has occurred at what was reported to be the NSW police headquarters in Sydney\u2019s CBD this afternoon. \n  A police operation in Elizabeth Street \u201chas concluded\u201d, a police spokesperson said in a statement: \n   \n   Police have arrested a man who is assisting with inquiries.No further information is available. \n   \n  \n Updated at 4.16am GMT \n \n \n  4.04am GMT  \n  \n  Thanks to Rafqa Touma for taking us through the news today so far.

She said: \n   \n   If we consider the size of the zone that\u2019s been declared off Gippsland, if it\u2019s all full, it can give us about 10 gigawatts of offshore renewable energy ... we\u2019re going to an option in 2032 which is to deliver at least two gigawatt. So 10 gigawatts already [in] just Gippsland itself is more than enough. It\u2019s five times more than what we actually need to have a successful auction. \n   \n  She said Bowen\u2019s declaration today will add further acreage that can accommodate 3GW: \n   \n   When you take those together, you can see Gippsland the wind gives us five times more area for projects to be built to deliver those gigawatts. So that\u2019s not the issue for us in Victoria \u2026 The issue here is what is next in terms of the commonwealth government\u2019s commitment ... We need a plan from them. \n   \n  D\u2019Ambrosio said the federal government needed to introduce a national wind target: \n   \n   They\u2019ve got a national target for hydrogen. They\u2019ve got a national target for a range of other renewable energy technologies. They don\u2019t have one for offshore wind.

It\u2019s really exciting. We\u2019re doing a lot of the heavy lifting in Victoria. And the real question here, of course, is that what happens next from the commonwealth government? I mean, they\u2019ve done the paperwork for declaring the zones. They\u2019re doing feasibility licenses, that\u2019s all well and good, but their job does not end and should not end once they finish the paperwork for what is an essential new industry, not just for Victoria, but for the rest of the country. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.19am GMT \n \n \n  2.25am GMT  \n  \n  Up to $10m additional fines possible if Optus does not meet review requirements \n  Optus could be hit with a further fine of up to $10m if it does not meet requirements from the review. \n  \u201cAll telcos need to have systems in place that ensure they are meeting their obligations, including having robust oversight and assurance processes for third-party suppliers,\u201d Yorke said. \n   \n   When emergency services are hindered, there can be very serious consequences for the safety of Australians. \n   \n  An Optus spokesperson said it accepted that proper audits were not in place to ensure the database requirements were being met. \n  \u201cWe apologise for this and accept that we have not met community expectations,\u201d the spokesperson said. \n   \n   Optus has now introduced those audits and checks-over its supplier\u2019s performance to ensure this issue is not repeated.

She said: \n   \n   While we are not aware of anyone being directly harmed due to the non-compliance in this case, it\u2019s alarming that Optus placed so many customers in this position for so long. \n   Optus cannot outsource its obligations, even if part of the process is being undertaken by a third party. \n   \n  As well as the financial penalty, Optus will be required to carry out an independent review of its compliance with the database, which is court enforced, and adopt any of the recommendations put forward. \n  \u2013 Australian Associated Press \n  More to come in the next post. \n  \n Updated at 2.18am GMT \n \n \n  2.05am GMT  \n Qantas fined $250,000 for standing down worker who raised Covid concerns \n  \n  Qantas has been hit with a $250,000 fine after it was found guilty of breaching workplace health and safety laws in standing down a worker for raising Covid-19 concerns, AAP reports. \n  The airline agreed in late February to pay $21,000 to Theo Seremetidis, a trained health and safety representative who directed others not to clean planes arriving from China early in the Covid-19 pandemic. \n  Seremetidis was stood down by Qantas subsidiary Qantas Ground Services (QGS) in February 2020, hours after he told others to cease cleaning and servicing planes over concerns staff could be at risk of contracting the virus. \n  Judge David Russell handed down the $250,000 penalty to Qantas in the NSW district court on Wednesday. He said: \n   \n   The conduct against Mr Seremetidis was quite shameful. \n   Even when he was stood down and under investigation, QGS attempted to manufacture additional reasons for its actions. \n   \n  Russell said Qantas acted to advance its own commercial interest in taking the action: \n   \n   There was a gross power imbalance between senior managers at QGS and Mr Seremetidis, a part-time employee on a modest wage. \n   \n  The airline faced a maximum penalty of $500,000.

Spending rose 0.6% in the December quarter, although well down on the 1.5% expansion in the September quarter, the ABS said. \n  Much of that spending was on benefits to households, but outlays to hold the voice referendum also sprayed a bit of money into the far reaches of the nation. \n  Extra benefits meant household spending not only grew (albeit 0.1%) but it helped the income to savings rate turn positive to 3.2% for the first time after two years of declines. Among other things, that means there\u2019s a bit more left in the kitty for many if the rainy days return. \n  Incomes are also rising at about the pace of inflation and will probably be outpacing price increases during the current quarter. \n  Add in the prospect of inflation falling further, tax cuts by July and possibly RBA rate cuts not too long after that, it\u2019s not hard to see things turning around for many. (China growth prospects being one possible headwind.) \n  Anyway, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is saying the \u201cquite weak\u201d growth was still welcome in the circumstances. He compared Australia\u2019s 1.5% GDP growth in 2023 with other nations. \n  (According to the Economist, the US economy grew 3.1% last year, while Japan eked out 1% growth and the UK shrank 0.2%. The Euro area grew 0.1% and Canada 0.5%.) \n  \n Updated at 1.30am GMT \n \n \n  1.18am GMT  \n 'Even weak growth is welcome growth,' treasurer says \n  \n  The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is speaking at a press conference on the national account numbers announced a short while ago. \n  He says the numbers show that Australia\u2019s growth is \u201csubdued but relatively steady\u201d: \n   \n   In the face of high interest rates, high moderating inflation and ongoing global economic uncertainty, the Australian economy grew by 0.2% in the December quarter to be 1.5% higher through the year, according to the ABS. Growth slowed over the year but it held up in the quarter. \n   The economy grew a little but not a lot. Growth in our economy was quite weak as we have expected. Even weak growth is welcome growth, in the circumstances. Slow growth is still significant growth, given challenging global conditions combined with the impact of higher interest rates. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.40am GMT \n \n \n  1.08am GMT  \n  \n  Growth slowed each quarter in 2023 but nadir might be near \n  A revision to the September quarter figures (to 0.3% growth from 0.2% previously reported) meant Australia\u2019s economy slowed in each quarter in 2023. \n  Still, it did avoid a fall, and with the RBA all but done on lifting rates, inflation ebbing and tax cuts flowing from the middle of the year, it\u2019s not out of the question that things might start looking up before too long. \n  As it turned out, trade was key to growth remaining positive while a drop in inventories didn\u2019t do as much damage as expected. \n   \n   \n    (Breaking): Australia's GDP expanded 0.2% in the December quarter, with a boost from \"net exports\" offsetting other weak contributions.

We also get the yearly ones that are probably easier to digest. \n  Economists are predicting the December quarter posted a 0.2% increase from the September quarter, which, while not great, would at least not be a negative. In fact, a positive figure would make it nine quarters in a row of growth. \n  At an annual level, those economists are expecting GDP was 1.5% larger in 2023 than in 2022. \n  Once the growth of the population is taken into account, though, per capita GDP was flat in the December quarter of 2022 and has been shrinking each quarter since. The December numbers should confirm that dismal outcome has continued. \n  There\u2019s something of a trade-off going on. The weaker the growth, the more likely it is that the Reserve Bank will be cutting its key interest rate, saving households on variable mortgages (and businesses too). \n  Bring it on, you say. Unless, of course, the economy hits the skids and employers start shedding more of their staff \u2013 a bad result for many. \n  Ahead of today\u2019s numbers, investors weren\u2019t predicting any more RBA rate rises but the timing of the first cut may hinge on how weak or strong the GDP figures are. The first cut of 25 basis points to 4.1% isn\u2019t fully priced in until October, according to the ASX tracker. \n  We\u2019ll find out soon enough. Don\u2019t go too far away. \n  \n Updated at 12.28am GMT \n \n \n  12.08am GMT  \n  \n  The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, also makes a brief statement on the tabling of the report by Victoria\u2019s special inquiry investigating historical sexual abuse at 24 government schools, including Beaumaris Primary. She says: \n   \n   I want to thank the victims and their families and loved ones who have supported people for so many years through the trauma and grief, experienced \u2026 in our education settings and I want to thank them for their courage and strength, not just participating in this inquiry but for driving this inquiry in the first place. The report has been tabled in the parliament this morning. \n   The deputy premier, the minister of education and I will be meeting with some of the representatives who are here in the chamber today to see that report. We are going to consider that report.

A small number of people who behave like this, who put their safety at risk, the safety of other Victorians at risk. \n   Victoria police responded really quickly and we\u2019ve seen too, in terms of the prevent powers, they\u2019ve already made a couple of arrests \u2026 suggests that Victoria police have demonstrated very clearly that they have the powers and the resources that they need to respond to incidents like this and I thank them for it. \n   I also thank the way Victorians responded by supporting each other in an incredibly frustrating set of circumstances.

One company was 1xBat, the other was Parimatch. \n  Australia\u2019s Interactive Gambling Act prohibits offshore gambling companies from offering bets to people based in Australia and bans the promotion of their services. But an exemption is offered if an ad is \u201can accidental or incidental accompaniment to the publication of other matter\u201d. In the case of Cricket Australia and 1xBat, the ads were not shown to Australian audiences. \n  An Acma spokesperson said: \n   \n   The ACMA is considering the information about the Aus/NZ cricket including the context in which the content was alleged to have occurred. \n   \n  \n Updated at 11.29pm GMT \n \n \n  11.07pm GMT  \n  \n  Spender wants \u2018people power plan\u2019 to address cost-of-living crunch \n  The independent MP Allegra Spender has kicked off a major energy conference in Sydney with a call on the Albanese government to fund a \u201cpeople power plan\u201d in its May budget. \n  With solar panels improving in efficiency and cost, and batteries falling in price by 20% a year, the economics are shifting inexorably towards renewables in the home \u2013 especially when power bills have been climbing in recent years. \n  But not fast enough, and many households \u2013 think renters \u2013 are missing out, hence Spender\u2019s push. (Almost half of those in her Wentworth electorate are renters and 60% live in apartments.) She says: \n   \n   Our power bills were driven up by Australia\u2019s dependence on ageing and unreliable coal-fired power stations and by the price gouging of a foreign-owned gas cartel, but there is a way out. \n   Home electrification is a massive cost-of-living and climate opportunity. But there are too many people who are still locked out. \n   That\u2019s not fair. \n   \n  Spender\u2019s plan would target renters and apartment-dwellers, among others missing out. Those in regional areas would also be a priority, not least because such communities are expected to host the wind and solar farms cities can\u2019t. \n  Regulatory reform would also be needed to break down the bureaucratic barriers, she said. \n  Funded by taxing the windfall profits of the gas industry, the plan could target half a million homes to electrify over the next three years. \n  That last part might be unwelcome by the government but the general push to spread the benefits of renewables is harder to reject. Recent strains in the power grid by just short heatwaves should be a reminder to governments state and federal that they have to do a lot more and soon to avoid more serious strains next summer (if not before). \n  Spender also told the Smart Energy Council conference that nuclear energy plans by the opposition didn\u2019t make sense. The technology was \u201ctoo slow and too expensive and [small modular reactors] are completely unproven\u201d, she said. \n  \n Updated at 11.37pm GMT \n \n \n  10.56pm GMT  \n  \n  The Southern Ocean wind zone was the third officially declared offshore wind zone in Australia and would bring 1,740 jobs to Portland and surrounds during construction, as well as 870 ongoing operational jobs, the ministers said. \n  The zone was expected to generate up to 2.9GW of offshore wind energy \u2013 enough to power more than 2m homes. \n  It was originally slated to be able to produce 14.6GW. \n  \u201cVictoria is leading the way in offshore wind, with the first wind zones in the country declared off the coast of Gippsland and the southwest coast,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said in a statement. \n   \n   This is another step closer to delivering our target of at least two gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2032 and will also help us get to net zero by 2045. \n   \n  The decision to significantly reduce the size of the wind zone followed lobbying from environmental groups, who posed concerns about marine life. \n  Feasibility licence applications for offshore wind projects in the zone are expected to close on 2 July. \n  \u2013 Australian Associated Press \n  \n Updated at 11.06pm GMT \n \n \n  10.44pm GMT  \n Ocean windfarms zone to be one-fifth of planned size \n  \n  The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has significantly reduced the size of Australia\u2019s third offshore wind zone after lobbying from environmental groups. \n  An offshore wind zone near western Victoria will be one-fifth of its original planned size. \n  Bowen made the announcement today, saying the decision to cut the area of the Southern Ocean wind zone followed extensive consultation with local leaders, industry and community groups. \n  The final area of the zone, to be located about 15km to 20km off Victoria\u2019s coast, would span 1,030 sq km rather than the initially planned more than 5,000 sq km, Bowen said in a joint release with the Victorian energy and resources minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio. \n  The zone would no longer take in an area off South Australia\u2019s coast, and the significant reduction accounted for the area\u2019s environmental, cultural heritage and economic significance, the ministers said. \n  \u201cThe Southern Ocean offshore wind zone has the potential to create thousands of new, high-value jobs and help secure cleaner, cheaper more reliable energy for regional Victoria,\u201d Bowen said in a statement. \n  The wind zone was slated to work around the Bonney Upwelling, Deen Maar Island and shipping routes. \n  \u2013 Australian Associated Press \n  More to come in the next blog post. \n  \n Updated at 11.29pm GMT \n \n \n  10.28pm GMT  \n Victorian government won\u2019t release safe injecting room report \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, says the government will not be releasing the Ken Lay report into a second safe injecting room for the CBD. \n  Last month, a motion passed the upper house requiring the Allan Labor government to publicly release the full Ken Lay Report by 6 March. \n  But Symes \u2013 who is also the leader in the upper house \u2013 says the government will claim \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d on the report: \n   \n   We will be claiming executive privilege just for the purposes of responding to the motion, but I want to reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to release that report, accompanied with a response from the government \u2026 at the same time. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.45pm GMT \n \n \n  10.17pm GMT  \n  \n  Coercive control and stealthing laws set to pass Queensland parliament \n  Removing a condom without consent will be considered rape and coercive control will become a criminal offence under a bill expected to pass through Queensland parliament today. \n  Coercive control is a pattern of behaviours that is highly correlated with the risk of domestic harm and homicide. Under sweeping reform by the Queensland government, it will become a criminal offence in 2025 and attract a maximum penalty of 14 years. \n  The act of stealthing \u2013 or removing or tampering with a condom during sex without consent \u2013 will be criminalised and carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. \n  Stealthing is illegal in Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the ACT. \n  The affirmative consent model is also expected to pass parliament.

She tells reporters: \n   \n   It\u2019s very brave to go out there and put yourself at risk to sound the alarm about our politicians not doing enough about climate change. I know that people were disrupted and I\u2019ve got sympathy for people \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating to have your day disrupted like that. \n   But look at the disruption that\u2019s been caused by climate change. We\u2019ve already had literally thousands of people evacuated from their homes because of fires this year. We\u2019ve had thousands and thousands of people without power because of storms exacerbated by climate change. These are the kinds of disruptions that we\u2019re seeing already because of climate change. And I think it\u2019s courageous for people to stand up and say, no, politicians need to do better. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.12pm GMT \n \n \n  9.54pm GMT  \n  \n  Victoria\u2019s police minister, Anthony Carbines, is not happy about the climate protest yesterday on the West Gate Bridge. \n  Speaking outside parliament, he says police moved as quickly as they could to bring it to an end: \n   \n   Protesters were making a point of being in a complex location. So it was always going to be very challenging and difficult for the police to move. That\u2019s part of the tactics that they employ \u2013 the despicable tactics that they employ \u2013 police deployed a cherrypicker. They did everything they could to remove protesters and we should be thankful for the work that they do. \n   \n  Carbines says the community were \u201cput at risk\u201d during the protest: \n   \n   We\u2019ve seen birth by the side of the road in traffic yesterday, others who missed medical appointments that are very serious. \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.05pm GMT \n \n \n  9.44pm GMT  \n  \n  Joseph Zammit defended his group\u2019s action in Melbourne magistrates court, saying they were concerned about people\u2019s futures: \n   \n   What they suffered today is nothing compared to what\u2019s going to happen in the future. \n   What we\u2019re actually doing is a service to the community. \n   \n  But Magistrate Andrew McKenna chastised the activists, saying the actions are hard to justify: \n   \n   It\u2019s not about anarchy. It\u2019s about an ordered society \u2013 the proper democratic way. \n   Whether someone has a worthy cause or not, you\u2019ve got to work within the law to promote it and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re liable to be punished. \n   \n  Bradley Homewood said he was forced to act after being driven to a state of despair over the existential crisis faced in a climate breakdown: \n   \n   I feel like I have no choice left. \n   I\u2019ve tried all the conventional methods of campaigning and nothing has worked. \n   We view what we do as a proportional response to the inaction from governments of the world. \n   \n  He defended his actions saying non-violent protests are vilified at the time but activists ended up vindicated in the future. \n  McKenna said the protesters would have produced the opposite reaction they desired among most of the community. \n  Deanna \u201cViolet\u201d Coco has had previous run-ins with police in Victoria, NSW and Western Australia for her activism. \n  She was jailed for 13 days after blocking a lane of the Sydney Harbour Bridge during morning peak hour in 2022. \n  Police accused Coco of making a career out of being a public nuisance. \n  As he jailed Coco, McKenna said she was completely uncaring of the victims of her actions: \n   \n   She basically put her own interests and her own cause ahead of the interests of others in the community \u2013 many more people than just she and two others. \n   \n  Zammit is due back in court on 16 April. \n  \u2013 Australian Associated Press \n  \n Updated at 10.43pm GMT \n \n \n  9.31pm GMT  \n Bridge climate protesters jailed for rush-hour chaos \n  \n  Two climate protesters are in jail for blocking traffic lanes on a major Melbourne freeway, causing significant rush-hour delays. \n  Deanna \u201cViolet\u201d Coco, 33, from NSW and 51-year-old Bradley Homewood from Williamstown pleaded guilty to two counts of public nuisance by obstructing motorists and obstructing police and emergency service workers on Tuesday. \n  Both were sentenced to 21 days imprisonment. \n  Their co-accused, Joseph Zammit, 68, from Melbourne, also pleaded guilty to the same charges. \n  He was released on bail on the condition that he not attend unlawful protests or undertake any unlawful actions during a protest and not associate with Coco and Homewood. \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  The members of environmental action group Extinction Rebellion parked a truck on the West Gate Bridge about 7.45am on Tuesday and climbed on top, unfurling banners which read \u201cdeclare a climate emergency\u201d and \u201cclimate breakdown has begun\u201d. \n  Police alleged they set off flares while on top of the truck. \n  The protest caused a traffic gridlock with three city-bound lanes blocked and delays stretching about 30km. \n  Officers used a cherrypicker to arrest and lower the trio safely at 9.45am after they refused to get off the truck.

At $28bn over 10 years, the Greens argue the cost is equivalent to the amount spent on rental deductions for property investors. \n  It comes as the Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, prepares to debate the issue with Mike Zorbas from the Property Council at the National Press Club today. \n  \n Updated at 9.10pm GMT \n \n \n  7.38pm GMT  \n  \n  Optus fined $1.5m after failing to add close to 200,000 customers to emergency services register \n  Optus has agreed to pay a $1.5m fine for a large-scale breach of public safety rules, after failing to add close to 200,000 customers to the register of numbers accessed by emergency services for warnings over disasters such as floods and bushfires, and by 000 to provide location information to the police, ambulance and fire brigade. \n  The error was discovered through a compliance audit that indicated Optus failed to upload the data for customers on the Coles Mobile and Catch Connect brands to its outsourced provider, Prvidr, between January 2021 and September 2023. \n  The Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) member Samantha Yorke said: \n   \n   When emergency services are hindered there can be very serious consequences for the safety of Australians. \n   While we are not aware of anyone being directly harmed due to the non-compliance in this case, it\u2019s alarming that Optus placed so many customers in this position for so long. \n   \n  An Optus spokesperson said the company accepted proper audits and checks were not in place for services supplied through partner brands, and that this had been rectified. The company apologised for the error. \n  Telstra and Aussie Broadband are among the other telcos to have copped fines for similar breaches in the past 18 months, with penalties totalling $2m. \n  \n Updated at 9.13pm GMT \n \n \n  7.31pm GMT  \n Welcome \n  \n  Good morning.

But Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla has launched a fierce attack on the Australian car lobby for misleading the public about the impact of the Albanese government\u2019s clean car policy. The Australian arm of the company has accused the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries of running a \u201cconcerted public campaign\u201d against the government plan, including claiming to multiple media outlets that the price of popular utes could increase by up to $13,000 despite knowing this was not how the system worked. \n  The Malaysian prime minister has urged the world to accept China as a superpower in comments at the Asean summit in Melbourne. According to reports in the Nine newspapers, Anwar Ibrahim warned the summit of global disaster if the US and China cannot improve their tense relationship and said the risk of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea was exaggerated.  \n  It\u2019s the last day of the summit today and Anthony Albanese will mark the wrapping up by announcing $61.5m for a range of initiatives designed to strengthen ties with south-east Asian nations. More coming up. \n  Claims for the disability support pension took more than 80 days on average to be processed in the final months of last year and some local government areas are experiencing average wait times of more than 200 days, data has revealed. According to the data provided by the Department of Social Services in Senate estimates last month, disability support pension claims took an average of 82.2 days between September and December 2023.

Richard Marles has taken aim at Peter Dutton for his pre-emptive criticism of the possible Aukus announcement.

The Pacific island nation is one of the most susceptible to global heating and has asked the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on the issue. More than 100 nations including Britain and New Zealand on top of a raft of European, Scandinavian, Southeast Asian and Pacific nations co-sponsored the move. But some of the world\u2019s largest emitters including the United States, China and India haven\u2019t agreed to sponsor the push, which will come to a vote at the United Nations later in the year. Any advisory opinion from the Hague-based court would be non-binding. The Australian government has outlined climate crisis as an urgent challenge and the greatest threat to Pacific nations and security in the region.      Updated at 7.40am GMT     6.58am GMT       La Perouse site declared an Aboriginal place by NSW government From AAP: A former Aboriginal mission that has become a crucial place for Indigenous activism and resistance will be formally recognised in cultural laws. Aboriginal families have lived at the La Perouse site south of Sydney for more than 7500 years. The Frenchmans Bay location has a long and troubled history of oppression and dispossession, dating back the late 1800s when Aboriginal people were forced out of the city, with many moving to La Perouse. The site became a camping and meeting place, and then Sydney\u2019s first Aboriginal reserve from the 1890s to 1930s. The site has now been declared an Aboriginal place by the NSW government. Sam Kidman from Heritage NSW said it was a testament to the great resilience of Indigenous people. \u201cIt is a very special place of ancient history and ongoing cultural practices that we\u2019re acknowledging for its cultural significance, and to help protect it for future generations,\u201d he said.

The body of a 20-year-old man was recovered on Monday after he entered the water near the Fitzroy River Lodge in Western Australia\u2019s north. Another man, aged 40, was found drowned in the river on 10 February. Fitzroy Crossing was split by once-in-a-century floods in January which destroyed dozens of homes and collapsed the town\u2019s bridge. Repair efforts across the Kimberley region have been hampered by continued heavy rain with weeks still left to run in the wet season. The full rebuild of the Fitzroy Crossing bridge is expected to take years and the state emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, says it\u2019s not feasible to build a walkway under the conditions.    Updated at 6.46am GMT     6.26am GMT       Jason Clare highlights international links in address to Delhi students Ten new memorandums of understanding will be signed between Indian and Australian institutions on Friday, education minister Jason Clare has announced. Speaking to students at Delhi University on his delegation to India, Clare hypothesised moving through time. He said if you \u201cgot in a time machine and went back 50 years\u201d only 7% of Australians had a university degree.  Today, almost one in two young Australians do. We are a different country. Then minister Pradhan took me in his time machine \u2013 set to 2035. Twelve years into the future. By then the Indian government plans to have half of its young people in vocational and higher education. That is nation-changing stuff.  He said Australia had heard the call from India to be a part of its higher education plan.  Some already offer courses at Indian universities. Some want to set up campuses. Some are setting up offices. Some are here to sign agreements. All want to learn, want to help and want to be part of this bigger, deeper partnership in India. We\u2019re building on what is already a very close relationship. Right now, there are around 70,000 Indian students studying in Australia, mostly in higher education and vocational training. In the past 17 years more than one and a half million Indian students have studied in Australia. More than 1,700 of our university lecturers and tutors have Indian ancestry. Right here, Delhi University has memoranda of understanding with three Australian universities \u2013 Macquarie University, the University of Wollongong and the University of Melbourne. Tomorrow 10 new memoranda will be signed between Indian and Australian institutions.

Workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica has led to an unacceptable increase in the number of cases of silicosis and other silica-related diseases. Today, Safe Work Australia commenced the next stage of consultation on a prohibition on the use of engineered stone. Consultation is open through Safe Work Australia\u2019s Engage website until 2 April 2023. Stakeholder feedback from the consultation will inform a report to be provided to WHS ministers for their consideration. We will also work closely with WHS regulators and other stakeholders including industry and unions, to implement the options agreed by WHS ministers, including further national awareness and behaviour-change initiatives and regulation of high-risk crystalline silica processes for all materials, including engineered stone, and across all industries. I encourage all stakeholders to go to Safe Work Australia\u2019s consultation website Engage to take part and have your say on a prohibition on the use of engineered stone.        5.36am GMT    Marles calls for bipartisanship on Aukus, says Dutton\u2019s advice out of date    The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has taken aim at the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for his pre-emptive criticism of the possible Aukus announcement. At some point this month, Australia, the UK and the US are due to announce their plans for Australia\u2019s acquisition of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Yesterday and today, Dutton continued to argue the US Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines would be the best choice for Australia, rather than a British model in development. Marles told ABC TV the former Coalition government had presided over a \u201clost decade\u201d in terms of procuring a replacement for Australia\u2019s existing diesel-electric Collins class submarines. Marles added:  I\u2019m limited in what I can say. We are at a point where it won\u2019t be long before we are making the announcement about what the optimal pathway will look like. The opposition leader is obviously giving comments based on confidential advice he was provided almost a year ago. A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then. We\u2019re mindful of the issues that have been raised but people need to wait and see what is announced.  Asked whether he was worried Dutton\u2019s comments may have unsettled Australia\u2019s Aukus partners, Marles said:  Look, I think it is really important that there is bipartisanship. I\u2019m confident obviously that our partners in the United Kingdom and the United States are completely sure about where we stand on this and know that there is full government support in relation to it. They would obviously understand that the former government initiated the [Aukus] process and I do accept what the leader of the opposition has said that the opposition will provide support to whatever we announce in the near term. But I\u2019m not sure that speculation of this kind helps right now. We are really very much on the verge of an announcement. And I think what matters now is, when that announcement is made, making sure that that enjoys the support of the full spectrum of politics in Australia.  Marles said the government would ensure the opposition was \u201cappropriately briefed in respect of the announcement\u201d but added that Australia had \u201cobligations to our partners\u201d in the US and the UK.    Updated at 6.59am GMT     5.21am GMT    Mediation fails in Sally Rugg, Monique Ryan legal dispute    Mediation has failed to resolve the legal dispute between Sally Rugg and Monique Ryan, Rugg\u2019s lawyers have announced. In a statement Maurice Blackburn Lawyers Principal Josh Bornstein said:  Ms Rugg will seek to add claims of \u201cserious contraventions\u201d of the Fair Work Act against the Commonwealth. A serious contravention occurs where the breach of labour standards is knowing and systematic. The penalty for serious contraventions is a maximum of $660,000.00.\u201d Ms Rugg\u2019s claim is expected to include comments made by Dr Ryan. Mr Bornstein said \u201c Dr Ryan publicly acknowledged that her staff were working 70-hour weeks and that it was not safe. In addition, the Commonwealth has been on notice of unlawful excessive hours being worked for Parliamentary staffers for many years, including by reason of inquiries and reports to Parliament. Most recently, Kate Jenkins\u2019 2001 Set the Standard report documents that staffers working excessive hours was an important factor in an unsafe workplace. Ms Rugg\u2019s case will be a test case for what constitutes \u201creasonable\u201d overtime or additional hours for parliamentary staffers and may impact other white -collar employees in the labour market.  \u201cIf Ms Rugg\u2019s case succeeds, it will open the door for further litigation including class actions,\u201d Mr Bornstein said, adding the case would have implications for other Australian workers who claim to have been exploited by working undefined \u201creasonable additional hours\u201d.  Tomorrow morning, the federal court will hear Ms Rugg\u2019s application for an injunction to restrain the termination of her employment. After that issue is determined, Ms Rugg will then pursue her claims for compensation and other orders against the commonwealth and Dr Monique Ryan.       Updated at 5.34am GMT     5.11am GMT       Resilient DJs customers send sales higher David Jones has recorded surging sales at its high-end department stores, defying expectations that inflation pressures would curb spending. Sales lifted by 13.6% in the first eight weeks of 2023, according to accounts lodged by its South African owner Woolworths Holding, which is not related to the supermarket chain. In the six months to December, turnover increased by nearly 32% compared to the corresponding period, underpinned by strong shopper demand at its inner-city Australian stores. The robust sales figures contrast with a spending pullback recorded at retailers Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi, which suggests demand for luxury goods is proving resilient. Woolworths chief executive, Roy Bagattini, said there were no signs that consumers were switching to cheaper products. \u201cYou would expect these impacts to play through into a much more softening of demand or consumer demand, but we haven\u2019t seen that, frankly, in the first period of our second half and obviously we are buoyed by that,\u201d he said. Woolworths paid just over $2bn for the department store chain in 2014, and has agreed to sell it to private equity firm Anchorage Capital Partners for a fraction of the price after it proved to be a difficult investment. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of March. As part of the deal, Woolworths will retain ownership of the department store\u2019s prominent Bourke Street building in Melbourne.      Updated at 5.21am GMT     4.56am GMT    Sticky Fingers axed from Bluesfest lineup    Sticky Fingers have been taken off the 2023 Bluesfest lineup, after weeks of backlash over their place on the bill. In a statement festival organisers said:  We are sad to announce that Bluesfest has decided that Sticky Fingers is to step off the Bluesfest 2023 line-up. Bluesfest cannot, sadly, continue to support Sticky Fingers by having them play our 2023 edition and we apologise to those artists, sponsors and any others we involved in this matter through our mistaken belief that forgiveness and redemption are the rock on which our society is built. We thank everyone who has contacted us and advised their support in this matter, especially those suffering from a mental illness who feel that they cannot have their illness supported in a manner whereby they feel included in society. Sticky Fingers has done so many good deeds that have never been reported including building and funding recording studios and music education programs in disadvantaged regional communities. We will now move on, put this behind us and continue to plan and present our best-ever edition of Bluesfest\u2026 proudly.

She told the royal commission she had been unable to locate them on her email archive. She said the commonwealth\u2019s lawyers must have been able to find them through the email accounts of other witnesses. The commissioner, Catherine Holmes AC SC, pressed McGuirk about evidence she gave last year saying the first she\u2019d learned of income averaging was in early 2017. Holmes said the most charitable explanation was \u201ca false memory\u201d of \u201chaving those sensations\u201d. McGuirk said she based her evidence on the documents she had reviewed, adding she didn\u2019t have an independent recollection of the time. Holmes replied: \u201cSo you invented a memory?\u201d McGuirk said she\u2019d given evidence to the best of her ability, but added: \u201cHaving seen these [documents] I accept there had been times where I had interacted [with robodebt] before.\u201d McGuirk denied she had sought the new legal advice from Pulford with a \u201cpredetermined outcome\u201d to back her own 2015 approval of the robodebt plan. That internal advice remained the only formal legal opinion in support of the scheme while it operated. McGuirk remains a public servant at DSS. The inquiry continues.    Updated at 5.43am GMT     4.50am GMT       Public servant grilled over claims she \u201cinvented a memory\u201d at robodebt inquiry 1/2 A public servant faced intense questioning at the robodebt royal commission over claims she \u201cinvented a memory\u201d to hide her role in the scandal. Emma-Kate McGuirk held roles at the departments of human services (DHS) and later social services (DSS), including playing a key role in the government response to a Commonwealth ombudsman\u2019s investigation in early 2017. McGuirk told the commission last year she was among social services officials surprised to learn the robodebt scheme included the use of income averaging, given DSS had warned against this in 2015. But the commission was shown emails on Thursday that showed McGuirk, while at DHS, had given \u201cprogram advice\u201d approval for income averaging in May 2015, shortly before it was launched. The commission was also again shown a 2016 presentation from a DHS official that outlined the use of income averaging in the robodebt scheme. McGuirk, by this stage at DSS, accepted she was present at the presentation. The inquiry has been told that when the scheme faced the ombudsman\u2019s investigation in early 2017, it was McGuirk who requested legal advice from a senior DSS lawyer, Anne Pulford. Pulford\u2019s new advice contradicted her 2014 opinion saying averaging was unlawful.    Updated at 5.45am GMT     4.31am GMT       Activists pressuring federal government on Burrup peninsula development WA campaigners, Save Our Songlines are stepping up their protest against industrial activity on the Burrup peninsula in the Pilbara region, travelling to Sydney to pressure the federal government. They fear the massive Burrup hub expansion proposed by fossil fuel company Woodside could devastate ancient Indigenous rock art and sacred sites in the area, thought to be more than 60,000 years old. The federal government is currently deciding whether to grant the area cultural heritage protected status under federal legislation, with federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, recently having visited the state to announce the nomination of the Murujuga petroglyphs for Unesco World Heritage Protection. The campaigners, including traditional owner Raelene Cooper, were at Plibersek\u2019s office in Sydney earlier today and were pushing for her to step in, saying that important local history is at risk if the project goes ahead. Cooper said:  Any more industry on the Burrup means another Juukan Gorge on this minister\u2019s watch, and Tanya Plibersek needs to act now to make permanent protections for Murujuga under existing legislation while we wait for World Heritage to be confirmed by the UN. We know that people in Tanya Plibersek\u2019s electorate, and around the country, care about our culture and demand that this government protect it. We need to hold this government to account on its promises.  The event began with a statement from Gadigal elder Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grovenor who said she stood in solidarity with their struggle:  I give my whole-hearted support to our guests that have travelled from the Pilbara to bring a message about the importance of protecting their sacred areas at Murujuga on the Burrup peninsula.  The campaigners will also be meeting at the climate strike in Sydney\u2019s Town Hall on Friday.    Updated at 4.57am GMT     4.19am GMT    Western Sydney airport takes step forward    Sydney\u2019s future second airport in the city\u2019s western outskirts has marked another step forward on its road to opening at the end of 2026, with the International Air Transport Association allocating the facility its three letter airport code. WSI will appear on routes and flight tickets for those travelling to Western Sydney International, which will be named Nancy Bird-Walton airport. Sydney\u2019s main passenger airport, Kingsford-Smith airport in Mascot, uses SYD, as part of the same IATA code system that lists New York\u2019s John F Kennedy International airport as JFK and Los Angeles International airport as LAX. In announcing the code allocation, the federal government said the western Sydney airport project has reached 40% completion, with the bulk earthworks finished and the airside, landslide and terminal construction expected to peak later this year. The airport is scheduled to commence operations in late 2026 and will be capable of catering for up to 10 million passengers a year. It will form the centre of the western Sydney aerotropolis, a new growth region of Sydney that will also feature a new central business district named Bradfield City. Infrastructure and transport minister Catherine King said the allocation of the WSI code \u201cis an exciting step forward\u201d, and that the airport project \u201cis proving once again to be the catalyst for the socioeconomic transformation of this entire region\u201d. Finance minister Katy Gallagher said the Western Sydney airport project had already created more than 3,800 direct jobs.

Maddie Clark and Deaglan Godwin were suspended for a semester after a months-long investigation which they claimed they were gagged from talking about to media or friends. The students claimed the institution was attempting to \u201ccrack down on activism\u201d by suspending them both for half the year, with their punishments only confirmed after classes returned this week. In an email sent to Scott, Nick Riemer said the protest was part of a \u201cwider political context\u201d that should have been taken into account by the institution:  For a number of years now, we have been witnessing a dangerous escalation of political authoritarianism in this country ... protest is a cornerstone of any society which values democracy. There is no democratic requirement that it be decorous, measured or polite ... the university must not reinforce the dangerous anti-democratic norms that increasingly prevail in this country ... The much reported accusation that the protestors who dared to challenge [Turnbull] were \u2018fascists\u2019 is outrageous. Through its decision to suspend Deaglan and Maddie, the university can now be seen as validating this disgraceful slur ... the suspension dangerously cheapens our commitment to education, democracy and leadership, and I urge you to reverse it.    Related: Students who protested at Malcolm Turnbull event say they have been suspended for a semester    A University of Sydney spokesperson wouldn\u2019t confirm the punishments, saying they couldn\u2019t comment on individual processes \u201cdue to our privacy responsibilities\u201d. But they defended the institution\u2019s decision, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t take any disciplinary action lightly\u201d. They said in a statement:  We consider attempts to shut down speakers who have been invited to our campuses to participate in an exchange of views and ideas as contrary to our Charter of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom which defines the core values of our University in these matters. We have a rich history of activism and protest on our campuses, and all students and staff have the right to express themselves freely, as long as it\u2019s done safely and in accordance with our policies and the law. Protests may be rowdy and spirited, but they cannot interfere with the rights and freedoms of others. The safety and wellbeing of our community is our number one priority.     Updated at 3.57am GMT     3.44am GMT       Coalition claims Labor leaders divided on tax policy The opposition leader Peter Dutton has accused the treasurer Jim Chalmers of \u201cgoing to ground\u201d after yesterday morning refusing to rule out changes to a capital gains tax on the family home. Speaking in the Melbourne suburb of Bayswater this afternoon, alongside the Liberal candidate for Aston, Roshena Campbell, Dutton brought out the same line which Sussan Ley used this morning that the PM and the treasurer were \u201cat war\u201d with each other. (While Albanese ruled out changes to a capital gains tax on the family home on ABC Radio yesterday morning, Chalmers did not on Sunrise before clarifying at a press conference later that day he should have, but adding he did not want to encourage the media playing the \u201crule-in, rule-out game\u201d) Dutton went on to say today:  [The Australian people] got a glimpse into the real Jim Chalmers yesterday. Jim Chalmers was rushed back out a couple of hours later to try and tidy up the mess. Obviously the prime minister\u2019s urging and it seems today that the treasurer has gone to ground.  Dutton\u2019s sense of Chalmers having been rushed out yesterday at the PM\u2019s insistence doesn\u2019t quite square with the fact the treasurer had stepped up to speak on the release of the latest GDP figures as he does each quarter. Meanwhile, the treasurer\u2019s low profile today could have more to do with him celebrating his 45th birthday. However, perhaps Dutton could be forgiven for not knowing, because only the PM received a celebratory tweet from Australian Labor.    Wishing the Prime Minister @AlboMP  the very happiest of birthdays today! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/LZAUqTWe9E&mdash; Australian Labor (@AustralianLabor) March 1, 2023      Updated at 3.50am GMT     3.28am GMT       More electric car charging stations rolling out across South Australia  The push to decarbonise transport is gathering pace, AAP reports. The Royal Automobile Association will develop a network of 140 stations across Adelaide and regional locations. It will include 86 AC fast-charging stations and 54 DC rapid and ultra-rapid locations, with construction to be complete by the end of next year. All will be powered by renewable energy, with the work supported by a $12.5m state government grant. The premier, Peter Malinauskas, said backing the faster uptake of electric vehicles made sense from an economic and environmental standpoint.  At a time when petrol prices are stubbornly high, South Australia has abundant renewable energy, particularly in the middle of the day. Electric vehicles will play a crucial role in storing that energy and using it productively.     Updated at 3.35am GMT     3.07am GMT       Murder suspect arrives in Cairns after India manhunt The man suspected of killing Queensland woman Toyah Cordingley has touched down in Cairns, where he is expected to be charged with murder. Rajwinder Singh, 38, arrived on a privately chartered jet today after spending his first night in Australia behind bars. More than four years after Cordingley\u2019s body was discovered partially buried on Wangetti Beach in October 2018, Singh made his return to the tourist city under police escort. Handcuffed and flanked by detectives, the former nurse arrived at the Queensland government air base in Cairns early on Thursday afternoon. He is expected to be taken to Cairns police station, where he will be formally charged. A day earlier, Singh arrived in Melbourne from Delhi before a Victorian magistrate ordered his return to the state he allegedly fled when Cordingley\u2019s body was found. Police believe he hid out in Punjab state after fleeing Australia, leaving behind his wife and three children at their Innisfail home. Detective acting superintendent Kevin Goan said on Wednesday that Cordingley\u2019s family had been told Singh would return to Queensland. He said:  They\u2019re clearly overwhelmed but delighted that, again, the judicial process will commence on Australian soil in the very near future.  Magistrate Martin Grinberg ordered Singh to be extradited to Queensland after hearing police had DNA and telephone evidence linking him to the case. He has been remanded in custody and is expected to appear at a court in Cairns once charged. Singh denies having murdered Cordingley. - AAP      Updated at 3.19am GMT     2.58am GMT       Coalition vows to back Labor submarine choice The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has pledged the Coalition will support the Albanese government\u2019s choice of nuclear submarine, despite suggesting US vessels are the best option. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to travel to Washington this month to announce alongside US president Joe Biden and his UK counterpart, Rishi Sunak, which submarine Australia will acquire under the Aukus security partnership. Dutton has repeatedly insisted the US Virginia-class submarines remain the quickest and cheapest option for Australia, as speculation mounts an under-development British boat will be chosen. But he said the government will receive bipartisan support for its decision. The former defence minister told 2GB radio today:  Labor\u2019s going to make a decision about which submarine they go with, but we\u2019ll support whatever decision they take.  Dutton said his preference for the US model was \u201cno slight on the Brits\u201d.  The Brits have been allies of ours forever and for the sake of our country I hope that\u2019s always the case of the future.  - AAP      Updated at 3.08am GMT     2.45am GMT       Wong extends Australia\u2019s condolences to Turkey at G20 meeting Foreign minister Penny Wong has caught up with her Turkish, Singaporean and Canadian counterparts on the sidelines of the G20 foreign ministers meeting.

Labor\u2019s Mookhey said there needed to be a rebalancing of where development happens, including greater density \u201cacross the city\u201d rather than focusing just on Western Sydney. Treasurer Kean rebuked: I hope every person living in a \u2018teal\u2019 seat has just heard Labor\u2019s plan for overdevelopment across the city\u2019s east and north.

Updated at 2.34am GMT     2.13am GMT       Labor stands by policy on public sector wages New South Wales Labor\u2019s treasury spokesperson, Daniel Mookhey, defended Labor\u2019s plan to scrap the public sector wage cap if it forms government after 25 March. He said that the government should not be able to avoid bargaining with workers as private companies are required to do, which he also argued was causing people to leave the public sector. He said:  When we are facing such a critical shortage, when we don\u2019t even have enough teachers in our classrooms, then yes, we say it is time to do something differently.  Treasurer, Matt Kean, said the policy would cost businesses who would have to compete with the government for labour. He said:  We have a wage cap in place that\u2019s maintained fiscal discipline, which is how we\u2019ve delivered the services and infrastructure that this state deserves. If that wages cap is removed, then it will blow the budget.

Kean used the Business NSW event to announce a Coalition government would pay businesses dealing with the state within five business days. He said:  We understand that cashflow is critically important for your success now and into the future.  Kean took aim at Labor\u2019s plan to lift public sector wages:  What it will mean for each and every one of you is that you will now be competing for labour against the public service who were paying huge wage increases. Imagine what happens when you\u2019re competing against the might of government and the public servants who were paid huge pay increases.  Labor\u2019s Mookhey said part of his plan to improve the economy was to stabilise the energy grid and energy prices, as well as bring manufacturing onshore. He said:  We are committed to creating the NSW energy security cooperation, whose mission is to partner with you [businesses] to stabilise the grid so we can bring on more of the future power we need at a price people can afford.

Updated at 2.00am GMT     1.51am GMT       NSW Greens announce energy policy to \u2018decarbonise the economy\u2019 The NSW Greens have announced their energy policy heading into the March state election with a plan to \u201cdecarbonise the economy and deliver affordable renewable energy, for every household\u201d. Under the plan, the party says it would establish a new public, non-profit electricity company called PowerNSW to reduce power bills. They would also invest in publicly owned renewable energy projects, stop all new coal and gas projects and phase out the use of coal and gas for energy by 2030. Gas would be banned on new builds from 1 July 2024. There is also a proposed package to support households and tackle energy poverty with:  rollout of energy efficiency upgrades, rebates and zero interest loans of up to $3,000 to help households replace gas appliances with energy efficient ones mandated minimum efficiency and thermal comfort standards for rental properties by 2028  The Greens spokesperson for treasury and energy, Abigail Boyd, said the proposals would \u201cdeliver affordable renewable energy for every household\u201d.  We must take back control over our power supply and ensure that we are never again at the mercy of the private market for our energy needs.  Cath Blakely, the party\u2019s candidate for the seat of Wollongong, said the plan \u201cwill immediately provide cost-of-living relief by lowering power bills, and lays out a plan for electrification by getting one million homes off gas\u201d.  Energy bills are skyrocketing across the state, plunging people into energy poverty, but neither NSW Labor nor the Coalition have any credible plan to reduce energy costs for households.     Updated at 2.00am GMT     1.37am GMT       Robert rejects in \u2018strongest possible terms\u2019 that he didn\u2019t take seriously robodebt advice from solicitor general Former government services minister Stuart Robert has rejected in the \u201cstrongest possible terms\u201d claims aired at a royal commission that he didn\u2019t take the solicitor-general advice on the robodebt scheme seriously. Robert also rejected as non-sensical claims levelled by the former secretary of the Department of Human Services, Renee Leon, on Tuesday that the minister had responded to her recommendation that the program cease and the government apologise by saying \u201cwe will double down\u201d. The inquiry heard on Tuesday that Leon had told Robert in a November 2019 meeting that the best course following the solicitor-general\u2019s advice was to apologise, cease the scheme and tell customers how they\u2019d fix the problem. She claimed Robert said they would \u201cabsolutely not be doing that\u201d and would double down. Asked about the alleged encounter on Thursday, Robert said:  I don\u2019t recall that. It would be completely inconsistent with the fact that I\u2019ve got the solicitor-general\u2019s advice, advice I wanted. I\u2019d taken it to the prime minister, the prime minister had agreed to an urgent ERC, he\u2019s agreed to ceasing averaging solely and partially, he wanted to look at further proof points \u2026 I would have relayed that to the secretary. The idea, somewhat farcically, that I\u2019ve come out of the prime minister\u2019s office, who\u2019s agreed with the solicitor-general\u2019s view, agreed to an urgent ERC the next week, that I would then ignore those two and say we\u2019re going to double down on the same project, doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.  Robert also rejected claims he had remarked during a verbal briefing on the solicitor-general\u2019s advice in late October 2019 that \u201clegal advice is just advice\u201d. Leon\u2019s evidence was that Robert was briefed in writing about the risks of continuing the program following this alleged comment, which she said was evidence to demonstrate he didn\u2019t support stopping the program. Robert said:  I completely reject that ... in the strongest possible terms. I asked for the advice, I wanted it. My department took months and months and months to get it to me, and when they had it, they ostensibly sat on it for six weeks ... When I got it, I demonstrated the seriousness by walking straight into the prime minister\u2019s office.     Updated at 1.42am GMT     1.32am GMT       Dwelling approvals slump 28%, with houses at 10-year lows We\u2019re told by the RBA and others that the answer to solving the housing crisis is supply. Based on the latest dwelling approvals data from the ABS out today, a boost of supply is not likely to be forthcoming for a while at least. Total approvals slumped 27.6% in January, seasonally adjusted, more than reversing the 15.3% gain in December, the ABS says. (CBA has predicted a 7% slide in the total.)    Dwelling approvals cratered in January, falling 27.6% seasonally adjusted. Private sector house approvals sank 13.8%, the fifth consecutive drop, to be the lowest level since June 2012, ABS says. pic.twitter.com/zCDwvAsH2v&mdash; @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) March 2, 2023    For private sector houses, approvals sank 13.8%, the fifth month in a row of falls, bringing the number to its lowest since June 2012. The overall dwellings retreat was led by a 49% dive in NSW and nearly 39% in Victoria, the two most populous states. Queensland, which is enjoying a bit of a population rush, bucked the trend with a 25.6% rise for the month, led mostly by new flats going up. In value terms, the building approvals were off 18.6%. Today\u2019s numbers will also be a drag on economic activity which is already slowing as we saw with yesterday\u2019s GDP numbers. With more interest rate rises to come, it won\u2019t be surprising if approvals fall even more. The Housing Industry Association, a lobby group for the sector, is already predicting 2023 will be the worst year in a decade for new construction.    Updated at 1.34am GMT     1.18am GMT    Australia\u2019s RMIT to launch dual degree program with India    RMIT will launch the first dual degree program with India under the nation\u2019s sweeping new education policy. Announced on a delegation with education minister Jason Clare at Delhi on Thursday, the higher education partnership with Birla Institute of Technology and Science will begin in mid 2023. India\u2019s National Education Policy came into effect in 2022 with the aim of attracting international universities to set up branch campuses in the nation and rapidly expanding its tertiary education sector. The partnership will initially offer four undergraduate engineering programs through a dual degree and a PhD program. Students will initially learn at BITS followed by two years at RMIT, with potential careers in Australia or India. RMIT academics will also be able to teach at BITS. RMIT vice-chancellor professor Alec Cameron said the academy was a \u201cstrategic step\u201d in strengthening the university\u2019s presence in India. BITS vice-chancellor Professor Souvik Bhattacharyya said the academy would be a \u201cnew dimension\u201d in trans-national education and research.  We look forward to a new era of academic cooperation that will define and deliver the best attributes of a global graduate and citizen.  International academics have told Times Higher Education they are skeptical India\u2019s policy will attract many takers, citing concerns over academic freedom and a heavily bureaucratic system.    Updated at 1.21am GMT     1.05am GMT    Robert: 'I have no choice as a cabinet minister but to defend government policy'    Robert is then asked about his doorstop interview regarding the Gordon Legal class action, which he called a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d. Scott:  Do you accept that your assertion of a 99.2% effectiveness rate, based on the state of mind that you say you arrived at on the 4 July 2019, was false?  Robert:  I do accept that now, but again Mr Scott, as I said to the commissioner, I am still at that stage a cabinet minister. I\u2019m still required to uphold, until such time as I am advised lawfully otherwise, the requirement for the government program, I\u2019d still have to defend it. That is the job I\u2019ve got.  Scott:  Despite what you knew to be the case, which is that you could not lawfully rely on income averaging as a sole basis to calculate and raise a debt?  Robert:  Despite what I thought was the case, noting I am not a lawyer \u2026while I couldn\u2019t reconcile the numbers that doesn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t be wrong and until such time as I have got the advice, respectfully Mr Scott I have no choice as a cabinet minister but to defend government policy.     Updated at 1.42am GMT     12.53am GMT    Robert says he made false statements about robodebt in TV interviews because it was \u2018the approach that cabinet had signed off\u2019    Robert is admitting he made false statements about robodebt in media interviews because of cabinet solidarity. Asked about his interview with Laura Tingle in August 2019, Robert says \u201cone doesn\u2019t tend to forget interviews with Laura Tingle.\u201d Robert\u2019s response to Tingle\u2019s questions about income averaging was a flat-out defence of it. He tells the commission now he was bound by cabinet solidarity regardless of his personal views at the time. Scott:  Do you accept, Mr Robert, that what you\u2019ve said in response to that question from Ms Tingle is inconsistent with the state of mind you assert you held at the conclusion of the deep dive session?  Robert:  Yes I do, keeping in mind if I\u2019ve got a personal opinion, my next step is to seek the appropriate advice, until such time as that arrives, I remain a cabinet minister and I am responsible for holding the cabinet line which is what I have done in the interview. \u2026 In every interview government ministers are expected to show confidence in the government. Cabinet ministers can\u2019t go out and defend some parts of the government\u2019s program and be wishy-washy on others. That is just not how a government can operate Sir, respectfully.  Robert was also asked about his interview with David Speers in July 2019: Holmes:  Your evidence was that you could not raise a debt based solely on averaging.  Robert:  That was my belief, yes.  Holmes:  And in 90% of cases that is exactly what was happening under the program to your knowledge.  Robert:  That is correct.  Holmes:  So what you said there, to your knowledge, at the time was false.  Robert:  My personal view, yes, but I am still a government minister and it is still a government program and this was the approach that cabinet had signed off on three or four years earlier and had been going on and until such time as I\u2019m not a lawyer, I\u2019ve got a competent legal view, it is still just my opinion.  Probed that he knew the departmental figures couldn\u2019t be right, Robert answers:  I had a massive personal misgiving, yes, but I\u2019m still a cabinet minister.  Holmes:  Yes, but it doesn\u2019t compel you to say things that you don\u2019t believe to be true, surely? It\u2019s one thing to stick to the policy and say this is how we do it and we are confident in the program but to actually give statistics which you couldn\u2019t have believed to be accurate is another thing, isn\u2019t it?  Robert:  They were the numbers from the department based on the working approach to how the program was being run. They were the accepted figures by government to use. And as a dutiful cabinet minister, that is what we do.     Updated at 1.49am GMT     12.45am GMT       Robert says it\u2019s \u2018unconscionable\u2019 he was not given the advice Robert:  The fact that that would not be given to me in writing is simply unconscionable. And I\u2019ve chosen my words carefully.     Updated at 12.48am GMT     12.42am GMT       Robert says he didn\u2019t receive AGS advice on 4 July Robert is claiming he didn\u2019t receive the advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS).  This wasn\u2019t told to me by the secretary on the 27th, it was not in the blue book, it wasn\u2019t in brief 119 which covered all the legal aspects, it wasn\u2019t attached to nor referred to nor inferred of, in cabinet brief 120. So on the 4 July, what I\u2019m hearing and seeing from you is that my department had a brief and now had it for 27 March \u2026  Scott:  Yes.  Robert:  Therefore almost 100 days and [they] have not informed me in writing in any way shape or form. I do not recall this being briefed to me, I don\u2019t recall my department saying on the 4 July we have an AGS advice, because if we did, my actions would have been consistent with what I did on the 7 November when the SG advice arrived. My department had it for seven or eight weeks, I had it for two hours before I walked straight into the prime minister\u2019s office unannounced, put it down and said, we need to stop this, that was my actions then, if I had a copy of this, or if someone had chatted to me, not too sure if I or my staff would have got to the person first to take it from them. And then if I read that, I suspect my actions would have been the same as what I did on the 7 November as soon as I got the substantive brief in the assistant general.     Updated at 12.48am GMT     12.33am GMT       Robert says decision was made to seek legal advice on partial use of ATO average income data Robert says he started thinking the sole use of Australian Tax Office data was insufficient, but partial use might be OK, and therefore a decision was made to seek legal advice. Scott is confirming with Robert that, based on his statement:  You then held a strong personal view that the sole use of ATO average income data was insufficient to raise the debt but was unsure the partial use of ATO average income data was sufficient to raise the debt. For that reason, you decided that the next [move] to progress the issue was to obtain legal advice.  Robert:  Yes, there would have been a discussion about it, in terms of my staff unable to answer my obtuse, using those words, examples. My recollection is that there was little pushback in the room, everyone agreed that we needed to get it right.     Updated at 1.52am GMT     12.20am GMT       Stuart Robert: Treasury and Social Services \u2018fundamentally different\u2019 Robert tells the inquiry that when he began as human services minister he had previously been assistant treasurer and the way the two departments worked were \u201cfundamentally different\u201d.  At this point coming from Treasury, and having done over 30 bits of [legislation] in nine months I\u2019m very attuned to how Treasury works. Reading through it all became fairly obvious to my team and I that how Treasury works is fundamentally different to how Social Security works. And trying to pair the two is always going to be incredible difficult.  Robert said the Department of Human Services had a different way of calculating from the Treasury portfolio. He gave the example to his staff that robodebt just did not make sense if someone had earned no income for 51 weeks and then had earned $1m in the 52nd week, if you average that across 26 fortnights it would raise a debt and that could not be possible.    Updated at 1.53am GMT     12.15am GMT    Stuart Robert faces questions from robodebt royal commission    Stuart Robert, the human services and government services minister during the time of the robodebt scheme, has begun to give evidence at the royal commission on the matter. Counsel assisting Angus Scott KC will be taking Robert\u2019s evidence. My colleague Luke Henriques Gomes is listening in too and gives you a bit of background on Robert:    Robert, who was minister when the scheme came under legal challenge, also refused to apologise, including when he finally announced refunds on a Friday afternoon in May 2020.&mdash; Luke Henriques-Gomes (@lukehgomes) March 1, 2023      Months later, Robert then went on to take credit for being the minister who stopped the scheme.

Data group CoreLogic, though, has put out an assessment of what\u2019s happened to the regions\u2019 property prices over the past year. Bearing in mind that capital city prices are down about 9% from their peaks (according to ANZ), it seems these regions have fared a lot worse. Here\u2019s CoreLogic\u2019s assessment of the regions in northern NSW:    Perhaps not surprisingly, property prices in flood-hit regions of northern NSW and south-east Qld have slumped in the year since the deluge. Here&#39;s the NSW view.

(Source: @corelogicau ) pic.twitter.com/NaANT9VPdU&mdash; @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) March 1, 2023    Kaytlin Ezzy, a CoreLogic economist, said:  While the current tightening cycle has amplified the downturn in values, the declines seen across flood-impacted suburbs are significantly steeper compared to the broader region and are among the largest suburb declines nationally. Outside of one flood-impacted suburb in Brisbane, all other suburbs recording similar value declines were more expensive [than] Sydney suburbs, which are generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates.  Given household wealth and consumption are often linked, the slump in property prices might have a lingering effect on economic activity in the areas, it would seem. On the other hand, would falling values attract more people to live there? Ezzy leans towards a long-term drag, not least because of the scale of the flood events possibly precluding a rebound in property prices seen after floods in earlier years.  Given the severity of this event, and the short timeframe between major flood events, it\u2019s likely the current value declines across the Northern Rivers and impacted house suburbs in Brisbane could be more enduring.  Notably, \u201chomeowners, lenders and insurers are becoming more cautious of the risks associated with climate change and are adjusting their risk premiums accordingly\u201d, Ezzy says. Indeed, those higher risk premiums are likely to extend to other regions exposed to climate extremes in a warming world. Given Australia\u2019s notoriously volatile climate, particularly for rainfall, that could just about take in the whole country.    Updated at 12.15am GMT     12.01am GMT    Government reviewing new report on \u2018gobsmacking\u2019 sexual harassment allegations on Antarctic stations    The federal government has received another review into disturbing allegations of sexual harassment and cultural problems on remote Antarctic stations, which includes \u201csubstantial\u201d recommendations for change. The independent report by former Swimming Australia chief executive Leigh Russell, was commissioned by the environment department in September last year. It was prompted by an earlier report by ANU Professor Meredith Nash, which raised allegations of unwanted physical contact, displays of pornography, and limited provision for women menstruating. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek described the Nash report as disappointing and shocking. She called for urgent cultural change and the department commissioned Russell to make further recommendations to government. \u201cI was actually gobsmacked to read some of the reports here talking about pornographic material up on the walls [because] I really did think that we had eradicated this thing from Australians decades ago.\u201d Department of Climate Change, Environment and Water secretary, David Fredericks, said the Russell review makes a significant number of recommendations that need to be carefully assessed. In a statement, Fredericks said he planned to release the report later this month:  Ms Russell\u2019s review is a comprehensive analysis of progress on cultural change and creating an inclusive workplace, and the adequacy of systems, policies and processes to support people who work for the Australian Antarctic Division. The report makes a substantial number of findings and it is important that we now give careful consideration to this review, its findings and recommendations. These are complex workplace issues. our response needs to be considered and have due regard to the work, health and safety of staff.

The Liberal party is still to come to a party-room position on the referendum, and appears to be in no rush to do so \u2013 but escalating criticisms from deputy leader Sussan Ley, and maintained concern from Dutton, have some inside the party speculating the Liberals could resolve a formal no position (like the Nationals) or just allow their members to campaign and vote whichever way they like. A formal yes position, according to some, seems unlikely. On Sky News last night, Dutton pointed to his recent visits to Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and Western Australia, as factors against the voice \u2013 claiming some areas were doing fine on their own. Dutton said:  They don\u2019t want to be disrupted by a voice. I mean they support a voice, they made that very clear, but they don\u2019t want a voice that is going to disrupt their local decision-making. The voice has the potential to override the local Indigenous elders voice, and so people are understandably \u2013 even in the communities \u2013 asking for detail.  Sky host Peta Credlin, former chief of staff to Tony Abbott, claimed \u201ca lot of people are concerned, even when they have sympathy\u201d towards the voice concept. Dutton agreed, claiming there was \u201ca rising level of frustration with the way in which the prime minister\u2019s approached this debate\u201d. He said:  In some other communities, in Leonora for example, where we went in WA, huge issues around alcohol and violence etc, domestic violence, abuse of children, all of that playing out there. The voice is the furthest thing from their mind.  Dutton claimed there had been \u201cno engagement with us through any of that process\u201d. PM Anthony Albanese said he has met with Dutton at least six times about the voice in recent months. Dutton has been invited to two meetings of the government\u2019s referendum working group.    Updated at 11.50pm GMT     11.31pm GMT       Australia Post chief: \u2018We are very aware of our significant service obligations and we want to ensure we maintain those\u2019 Graham goes on to say how Australia Post has become a \u201ctwo speed business\u201d:  We have a distinct two-speed business, with our letters business weighing heavily on the e-commerce driven parcel business where we compete with multinationals and strong local players. We seek to gain bigger market share, but if we don\u2019t address our letter business, that will impact our ability to service the community, not just in our mail business and parcel business, our bank of post and other broad services we provide. We have started making change amid the challenges we face, but we want to hear from the community about what they want and how we chart our way forward as an essential service to the community. The good news is a financially sustainable, modernised Australia Post will continue to invest to meet the changing needs of communities in metropolitan Australia and regional and rural Australia. We are looking to continue to increase more delivery points, create more efficiency and make it easier for people to do business with Australia Post. We are very aware of our significant service obligations and we want to ensure we maintain those, but the way in doing it is to be sure we have a financially viable Australia Post. We look forward to working with the government and all stakeholders on this process and taking the feedback to help shape the future of Australia Post for the next 214 years.     Updated at 11.34pm GMT     11.27pm GMT       Australia Post CEO: \u2018We don\u2019t want to be a burden on the Australian taxpayer\u2019 Australia Post CEO Paul Graham follows the minister, saying the organisation welcomes today\u2019s announcement and wants to modernise so as not to become a \u201cburden\u201d on the taxpayer.  Australia Post warmly welcomes the minister\u2019s announcement today and we support both the discussion paper and the consultation process. The discussion paper in modernising the service of Australia Post is a conversation that frankly the Australian community needs to have. Our letters business is in unstoppable decline since 2008 and we face a difficult future as fewer people send letters and consumers increasingly embrace digital \u2013 a trend play playing out globally. Australia Post plays a critical role in the lives of all Australians and particularly in rural and regional Australia and remote areas. That will never change. For the past three years we invested more than $1 billion in our network, digital capability, people and services and we will continue to do that to ensure we are meeting the future and today\u2019s needs of our customers. But despite this, we\u2019re on a path to significant losses as Australians and the national postal service changes. We\u2019re an entirely self-funded business. We don\u2019t want to be a burden on the Australian taxpayer and using the funds we would otherwise lose to ensure that the government continue to invest in the right things for the community \u2013 hospitals, schools, roads etc.     Updated at 11.33pm GMT     11.22pm GMT       Australia Post workers to trial different delivery models Michelle Rowland:  Lastly, I want to acknowledge the most important asset of Australia Post is its people \u2013 the 60,000 workforce. I acknowledge the work undertaken by the Communication Workers\u2019 Union in conjunction with Australia Post to jointly develop trials of different delivery models. Feedback on the model will also be undertaken throughout April and June and it is vitally important the workforce is brought along on the journey, they\u2019re properly consulted and that we understand how important they are to ensure Australia Post remains financially viable, so that their jobs, their good-paying jobs, also remain viable.       Updated at 11.39pm GMT     11.21pm GMT    Government 'kick-starting process to modernise Australia Post'    The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has stepped up to speak in Sydney alongside the CEO of Australia Post, Paul Graham, announcing the launch of a discussion paper to ensure the service remains viable in the modern age. Rowland says it\u2019s a matter of updating the regulations in order to ensure Australia Post remains a \u201ckey driver of productivity\u201d in the economy:  Australia Post is a cherished national institution over 200 years. It delivers to over 12 million delivery points right around Australia. It performs a range of vital community service obligations, and especially in rural and regional Australia. Australia Post not only serves as the post office, often it is the only banking service in town, the newsagent, or the retailer, so it is important. But we know that Australia Post has been facing many challenges over a long period of time. These include the decline in letters being sent and received, and also the rise of parcels, and we know that Australia Post faces particular competition from international competitors who are coming in, building their own networks, and Australia Post needs to ensure that it remains viable. So what I\u2019m doing today is releasing a consultation paper on the future of Australia Post. What do consumers expect? What do small businesses need? How can rural and regional Australia be best served by this iconic institution? It\u2019s important for Australia Post to be seen as a key driver of productivity in our economy. It needs to be adaptive. It cannot stand still. We have seen what happens around the world to state-sponsored postal services when they fail. They fail their consumers and they fail their economies. We will not let this happen to Australia Post. That is the reason why we are kick-starting this process to modernise Australia Post. They are currently subject to essentially the same regulatory burdens as they had 25 years ago. We need to understand the challenges that Australia Post faces, but equally we need to be transparent and listen to Australians about what they need and how Australia Post can best service them \u2013 that is the purpose of this consultation.

The state\u2019s mines and petroleum minister, Bill Johnston, said industry could nominate areas for the state\u2019s annual acreage release, part of a government strategy for \u201cpromoting petroleum exploration\u201d:  The McGowan government will continue to support opportunities to invest in the petroleum exploration sector to help find the next big discovery. We are calling for industry to get involved and help shape the future of WA\u2019s petroleum sector.  It comes as bids are due to close for exploration permits over 10 areas covering nearly 47,000 sqkm the Albanese government announced last year would be opened for offshore exploration. At the time, the commonwealth acreage release was described as making a mockery of climate targets. Tim Beshara, of the Wilderness Society, described the latest announcement in WA as \u201cintergenerational recklessness\u201d.  It\u2019s hard to imagine a worse thing a government could do regarding climate and environment in 2023 than to lock in the carbon someone will seek to burn in 2073.     Updated at 11.14pm GMT     11.07pm GMT       Victorian government announces $10m for mRNA training The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced the government will spend $10m to establish a mRNA training centre to create a pipeline of workers to produce the next generation of vaccines and medicines. The training centre will be based at Monash University in Clayton and will provide specialised training to workers across all aspects of the mRNA manufacturing life cycle. Speaking at the university on Thursday, the premier said mRNA technology had the potential to be used to treat cancer, neurodegenerative conditions like MS and other conditions:  The possibilities are endless. But if you haven\u2019t got staff, you simply can\u2019t do the work and that will always hold us back. That\u2019s why this $10 million investment, together with our strong partnership with Monash University in so many different ways, really does set us up strongly for the future, whether it be exports, jobs in advanced manufacturing of these therapeutics and other vaccines.  It\u2019s not far from Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility currently under construction in Clayton, which once complete, will be capable of producing 100m vaccine doses annually. The facility is being established under a 10-year partnership between the federal and Victorian government and Moderna. It is Moderna\u2019s first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility to be built outside North America.

The commission earlier this week heard evidence that the former Coalition minister told the head of his department to \u201cdouble down\u201d on robodebt rather than admit fault. My colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes will be listening in to the hearings, and we\u2019ll bring you what Robert has to say on the blog.

Based on communications minister Michelle Rowland\u2019s interviews this morning, she has clearly stated \u201cAustralia Post will not be privatised\u201d. Here\u2019s Hanson-Young\u2019s full statement:  The Greens will look at the consultation paper and changes proposed by the government closely. Rumours about privatising postal services were at fever pitch under the previous Morrison Government - Labor should rule this out. Australia Post is a publicly-owned essential service that must truly service all Australians, whether that\u2019s in the city or the bush. Any review must be centred on delivering what everyday households and businesses need, not simply profits that deliver big salaries and bonuses to executives.     Updated at 11.02pm GMT     10.51pm GMT       Australians receiving on average about two letters a week as parcel business \u2018booming\u2019, communications minister says On the state of letter-writing in the country, Rowland says the decline is due to increasing digitisation as well as other considerations like the environment:  The letter volumes we\u2019ve seen are in decline. These are the facts. Some 97% of letters that go out these days are actually sent by businesses and government. And even in those cases they are becoming increasingly digitised and we know that for many businesses, that is certainly their aim, not only for cost-cutting but also to meet any obligations they have under, for example, environmental obligations. So when you have Australians receiving on average about two letters a week now, you need to really have a look at where demand is. And I actually see this very much, as I discussed with small business representatives and other people interested in this area \u2013 this is very much a productivity driver.  On the other hand, Rowland says parcel business is \u201cbooming\u201d but unregulated:  We know that parcels business is booming with some half a billion parcels delivered last year, but this is an unregulated side of Australia Post\u2019s business and it\u2019s subject to intense competition from major international players who are building, or are in the process of having built, their own networks. So we want to make sure that Australia Post remains financially sustainable and viable, because that means we can have good, well-paying jobs, the needs of Australians are met \u2026  Just to also make this point \u2013 I think many of your viewers will be surprised to learn that the regulations governing Australia Post today are essentially the same as they were 25 years ago. So that was 10 years before the first iPhone came into view as well. It\u2019s important we address this now.     Updated at 10.55pm GMT     10.47pm GMT       Communications minister: Australia Post will not be privatised Michelle Rowland, the communications minister, is doing the rounds this morning on breakfast programs following the release of a discussion paper seeking to make changes to Australia Post, with question marks around daily letter deliveries. Rowland told ABC News Breakfast:  The whole point of this consultation that we\u2019re kicking off today is to understand from Australians and in particular from small businesses and people representing rural and regional Australia, what they need in a modern Australia Post, have a look at the options going forward, but be upfront about the facts and the challenges that Australia Post is facing. We are very clear [and] upfront in the principles of this consultation that Australia Post will not be privatised, that we prioritise the needs of rural and regional Australia and that we want to hear from Australian consumers, businesses, and anyone with an interest in this great institution, about what they believe needs to be done going forward.

Bankstown police were called to Sefton just after 6.30am where they found a man with a gunshot wound. The man died at the scene despite the efforts of NSW Ambulance paramedics, police said. There are reports the man was sitting in a car outside the gym when he was shot at from a passing car. A man who was nearby says he heard a series of shots he initially thought was a car backfiring. He told Sydney radio 2GB:  As I heard a car speed off there was another series of bangs. Within minutes there was a load of ambulances, police everywhere, and then we saw a man on the ground, not in a good way.

Hundreds of people are being evacuated from remote communities where flood waters threaten to isolate residents. Heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding are forecast for parts of the Gregory, Tanami, Barkly and Carpentaria districts on Thursday. The rain is expected to spread east across the Barkly, with six-hourly rainfall totals between 90mm and 140mm possible. Intense storm cells and damaging wind gusts are forecast for the area south of Kalkarindji to Renner Springs. Territory authorities declared an emergency for communities where the upper Victoria River reached major flood levels on Wednesday. About 700 people were to be relocated by air to Katherine and then driven by bus to temporary accommodation in Darwin. NT police commander Daniel Bacon said access roads to the communities had been cut, with residents of Daguragu evacuated to Kalkarindji ahead of further inundation expected on Wednesday night. The Victoria River at Kalkarindji surpassed the major flood level of 14m, and was at 16.02 metres and still rising on Thursday morning. The town, about 550km south of Darwin, recorded the highest rainfall of 133mm to 9am on Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned residents of flash flooding across the Top End in locations including Tennant Creek, Elliott, Kalkarindji, Lajamanu, Renner Springs and Mallapunyah. Authorities have urged people in the area to avoid unnecessary travel to allow for a safe evacuation.

It seeks an advisory opinion from the ICJ on the international obligations that countries have to act on the climate crisis \u2013 with a request to pay particular attention to the harm experienced by small island developing countries that are especially vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. The ICJ will also be asked to consider \u201cpeoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change\u201d. It is understood the Albanese government will portray its support as recognition that climate change is \u201cthe single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific\u201d. In a statement, Jotham Napat, Vanuatu\u2019s foreign minister, said today:  While severe Cyclone Judy is today showing no mercy on the people of Vanuatu, it is welcoming news that countries are committing to co-sponsor Vanuatu\u2019s UN Resolution on clarifying international climate obligations.  Shiva Gounden, a Pacific adviser to Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said:  To see Australia and nations around the world standing with Vanuatu and Pacific island nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis cannot stop these impacts or end the pain they cause. But it does bring the Pacific Vuvale [family] closer together and show that the world recognises Pacific leadership in driving global solutions from the frontlines.

More than 250 years later, four of those spears will be returned to the Gweagal people of Botany Bay, which is known as Kamay in the local Indigenous language. A formal announcement will be made at Bare Island today. The removal of spears by Captain Cook and botanist Joseph Banks was a significant and lasting loss to the local Aboriginal community, as it was a theft of their cultural knowledge handed from generation to generation. For now, the artefacts remain at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, as part of an archaeology and anthropology collection. But they will soon be physically returned to their rightful custodians and displayed at the new visitor centre being constructed at Botany Bay.

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, came out in support of Archer when asked about the issue at a press conference, declaring her \u201can important part of our team\u201d. Archer appears to have the firm support of the Liberal leadership, with Dutton\u2019s deputy Sussan Ley doing the same. Ley told ABC Radio she should \u201cabsolutely\u201d retain her spot as the candidate for Bass at the next election:  Bridget is a friend, a colleague and a terrific member for the seat of Bass. I visited her not that long ago, and she\u2019s doing great work and she\u2019s an amazing woman, amazing woman. And you know, Patricia how much I respond well to amazing women.     Updated at 9.29pm GMT     9.11pm GMT       Ley quizzed on scale of impact from super changes Ley doesn\u2019t directly answer whether she believes people with more than $3m in super savings are doing it tough \u2013 she says it\u2019s the principle. Karvelas:  Do you think 80,000 people who\u2019ve got more than $3m are really doing it tough?  Ley:  Well, that $3 million is not indexed. That will change over time. And the principle is the thing that Australians will note.  Karvelas:  But are they doing it tough?  Ley:  I\u2019m not here to say who\u2019s doing it tough and who\u2019s not doing it tough.  Karvelas:  Australians are doing it tough, though, aren\u2019t they? And some are obviously not doing it tough.  Ley:  Well, people are doing it tough for the government that hasn\u2019t got the fiscal policy settings right. And doesn\u2019t understand how to manage money and doesn\u2019t have spending constraints anywhere within its programs. In all of this conversation, we have not heard anyone say that we\u2019re going to save money. I mean, that seems to be just a passing comment from the government. Yes, of course. People are doing tough. They\u2019re doing it tough because they can\u2019t pay their electricity bills. They\u2019re doing it tough because their mortgages are going up.  Karvelas:  But they\u2019re not the people with more than $3 million in their super accounts.  Ley:  I\u2019m not going to comment on what individual people might be experiencing in their family budgets. The direction this government is going is one that breaks faith with the Australian people and misunderstands the sound fundamental basis, which is: it\u2019s your money, you deserve to keep more of it.     Updated at 11.00pm GMT     9.05pm GMT       \u2018Treasurer at war with the PM\u2019 over tax policy, Ley claims The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, follows Gallagher on ABC Radio. She\u2019s not letting go of the divergence that emerged on breakfast shows yesterday morning between the PM and the treasurer on ruling out changes to capital gains tax on the family home. It was cleared up by a lunchtime presser where Chalmers ruled out the measure and acknowledged he \u201cshould have done the same this morning\u201d. Ley says:  Your program exposed it well. We\u2019ve got a treasurer at war with the prime minister, a prime minister who\u2019s openly overruling his treasurer \u2013 look, it\u2019s school yard stuff \u2013 and breaking promises made more than 97 times, opening the door now to more tax increases, and even taxing the family home. I think there\u2019s a new test for the Albanese government, Patricia \u2013 I\u2019m going to call it the PK test. Whatever idea Jim Chalmers floats in the papers, if that\u2019s confirmed by the prime minister on Radio National, then we know they\u2019re on the same page. Otherwise, I don\u2019t know whether they are at all, and right now they\u2019ve completely failed that test.  Patricia Karvelas goes on to try get Ley to respond to the changes the Coalition made to superannuation without a mandate:  You were a cabinet minister in 2016 when Malcolm Turnbull proposed a 15% tax on super accounts above $1.6m, which affected, actually, eight times the number of people. So it was actually a much bigger policy that had more impact than the latest one announced by this government. Did you support that?  Ley:  Yes, that was a different policy. It\u2019s applied to a balance transfer cap, by the way, it was indexed, and we took it to the election and then we legislated it \u2013 and that is the key difference here \u2026 The government was so careful to be so definite and prescriptive at the last election about not making any changes to super. I come back to my main point, this is breaking faith with the Australian people.     Updated at 9.23pm GMT     8.48pm GMT    Reforms needed to close gap between men and women\u2019s super, finance minister says    Superannuation has been leading this week\u2019s headlines after the government announced balances above $3m will be taxed at a rate of 30%, up from the current concessional rate of 15%. That change will only affect 0.5% of Australians, but the fact that 60% of that wealthy cohort are men is a reminder how gender impacts how much money Australians have when they retire. The average man will retire with 28% more in his super account that the average woman. The minister for finance and women, Katy Gallagher, is speaking to ABC Radio about what\u2019s being done to bridge the gap between the retirement savings of men and women.  The issue of gender equality isn\u2019t just about super in this country. We do have a problem. Women are more educated than men but we work less, earn less, have less savings, less super and assets and women over 60 are the most vulnerable group in the sense of being the highest group moving into the homelessness sector, so there\u2019s a whole range of issues. There\u2019s a couple of things that we\u2019re trying to do. One of the big issues around super is the fact that women earn less. And so closing the gender pay gap is a really important part of that. We\u2019ve got a bill in the parliament right now, which looks to accelerate closing of the gender pay gap, which sits at about 14 or 15%. And then there are the other issues which we\u2019ve made no secret we would like to do when we make room in the budget, which is looking at how we ensure for those gaps in women\u2019s earnings, when they\u2019re on parental leave and things like that, that we pay super.  Gallagher says she\u2019d like \u201cto do it now\u201d but points to the constraints of the structural deficit in the budget.  I would have liked that it was done 10 years ago. But the reality is we\u2019ve got a $50bn structural deficit, where as far as the eye can see the pressures on the budget aren\u2019t lessening, they\u2019re intensifying.     Updated at 10.18pm GMT     8.38pm GMT       NSW leaders to square off in battleground election debate The election battleground of western Sydney will be the site of a key debate between the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and opposition leader, Chris Minns, as NSW prepares to vote. With latest polls tipping a Labor victory on 25 March, the leaders will square off on Thursday at Rosehill Racecourse to debate important issues in Sydney\u2019s west. Winning the support of the region, home to more than a quarter of the state\u2019s population, will be critical to the success of both parties on polling day, amid cost of living pressures and housing affordability concerns. The event includes a panel discussion with representatives of Western Sydney University, Westpac, global accounting firm PwC and media. It comes as a poll found the cost of living, including food, utilities and housing is the top concern of 50% of voters. The survey, conducted by Resolve Strategic and published in the Sydney Morning Herald today, found most voters did not want new infrastructure funded through privatisation. Just 10% of those surveyed want public assets sold to pay for roads and rail, with 40% say infrastructure projects should be financed by cuts to other services, while 14% thought debt was preferable. The poll of 803 eligible voters found Labor\u2019s primary vote had lifted one percentage point to 38%, while the Coalition\u2019s had dropped two points to 32%. With 93 seats up for grabs, the data points to an overall swing of 7% to Labor \u2013 enough to deliver the 47 seats required to form a majority government. - AAP    Updated at 8.52pm GMT     8.26pm GMT       Australia Post will not be privatised, Communications minister says  The government is flagging that letters may no longer be delivered five days a week after the release of a discussion paper yesterday. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, spoke to ABC Radio about the state of letters in Australia:  Letters are certainly still being sent. But the reality is that 97% of them are actually being sent by business and government, but Australia Post has that obligation. And as long as people want to send letters, those letters will be delivered.  Rowland says the discussion paper \u201cabsolutely\u201d does not open up the possibility of selling Australia Post off to the private sector, which has happened in other countries:  The guiding principles, the very first one, explicitly states that Australia Post will remain in full public ownership.  Rowland maintains that the community service obligation to serve as all parts of Australia including rural and remote areas will not be axed despite the $348m price tag last financial year:  Australians do expect that they are going to be able to receive their parcels and their letters within a certain timeframe but of course parcels are not part of these performance standards. So that\u2019s precisely what we want to examine through this consultation process.

Updated at 8.09pm GMT     7.51pm GMT       Australia Post deliveries rethink In the modern age, should Australia Post still have to deliver letters every day? Under law, the letter service must \u201creasonably meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian community\u201d.

But with letter volume on a long and inevitable decline (who sends a letter?) that\u2019s a deeply unprofitable business.

Everybody is very frustrated and angry and something\u2019s got to give here. \n   \n  Claassens said trains that did not meet minimum maintenance standards could be affected by a range of issues \u201cfrom safety all the way through to cleanliness\u201d. He blamed outsourcing and extended time between maintenance inspections for failure to meet standards. \n  Meetings took place on Friday, Sunday, and Monday to try and resolve the long-running dispute over a new enterprise agreement and the union\u2019s safety concerns with the mothballed Korean-built fleet of intercity trains. \n  While the action that took trains out of service on Monday was in the union\u2019s advised calendar, Claassens said the union did not expect so many trains would not meet the standards. \n  Premier Dominic Perrottet said trains being out of action was incredibly disappointing and dismissed the industrial action the union has been engaged in throughout this month as \u201cpolitical games\u201d. \n  Perrottet said Monday\u2019s action was \u201cunplanned\u201d, although the union advised weeks ago it would not be operating trains that did not meet minimum standards. The premier said the trains did meet those standards. \n   \n   This is just the union once again taking action and inconveniencing people for their own political benefit. \n   None of us understood that it was going to have that massive impact, and that again has highlighted the problem that we\u2019ve got. \n   \n  \n Updated at 7.04am BST \n \n \n  6.49am BST  \n  \n  The blustery sunny day in Victoria has turned into blustery rain and hail and potential for minor floods.

The instances in question are examples of the latter. They are neither the first nor the last examples. \n   How these appointments are communicated is the prerogative of the government of the day. The Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General is not responsible for publishing these sorts of administrative appointments. As such, they are not and have not been included in the Office\u2019s annual reports, nor would the act of signing an instrument approving an administrative appointment be included in the governor general\u2019s program on the website. \n   In response to current media commentary, there is no secret or conspiracy in the office\u2019s reporting. The office routinely publishes details of swearing-in ceremonies and gazettes the details of when the governor general has directed a minister to hold office. However, the office is not responsible for publishing changes to the administrative arrangements for departments. Again, that is the prerogative of the government of the day. There has been no deviation by the office from past practice. \n   Acknowledging that the administrative appointments were not communicated \u2013 as expected, by the government of the day \u2013 the office supports a more transparent process to ensure that any appointments made under section 64 are made public. Noting that these reporting responsibilities are the prerogative of the government of the day, the office will await the recommendations of the current process before commenting further. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.40am BST \n \n \n  5.06am BST  \n  \n  Global stars feature on Melbourne\u2019s virtual art trail \n  A new augmented reality art trail has seen giant worms, skulls and spiders installed in Melbourne\u2019s public spaces - virtually, of course, AAP reports. \n  AR.

Some of that means you need one on one support. We need to look at employment services in the way that it has been operating as well because the advice from both long-term unemployed but also from employment services providers is that the structure that said if you have made 20 phone calls a week and ticked those boxes, that is what it is about. If it hasn\u2019t advanced the opportunity for you to get into employment, then that\u2019s just a paper shuffling exercise. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.35am BST \n \n \n  3.10am BST  \n  \n  Albanese says government will release report on Darwin port \n  Just circling back to the end of that press conference with the prime minister this morning.

He texted me that he wants to build nuclear power plants all over the state, he texted me that he wanted to go to the federal parliament, he texted me that he wanted to take the Nationals party out of the government. \n   \n  He said the exchange about the job was \u201csome time in December\u201d but he was not sure exactly when. \n  Kean said he did not think Barilaro was \u201cgenuine\u201d in his interest \u201cand I never heard from him again\u201d. \n  Barilaro was eventually appointed to the role before he relinquished it amid public backlash. \n  Here is our previous reporting: \n   \n    Related: John Barilaro withdraws from hearing of trade role inquiry, citing ill health  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.59am BST \n \n \n  2.37am BST  \n Christine Holgate 'disappointed' Morrison was secretly finance minister during Australia Post inquiry \n  \n  The former managing director of Australia Post, Christine Holgate, has weighed into the controversy surrounding Scott Morrison and his secret ministries. \n  In 2020 Morrison called on Holgate to resign after it was revealed she gave Cartier watches to executives, saying she should stand aside \u201cor she can go\u201d. Shortly thereafter, the finance department undertook a review into expenses at Australia Post. \n  It has now become clear that Morrison was secretly the finance minister at the time, having sworn himself in to the portfolio in March 2020. \n  In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, Holgate said: \n   \n   I was as disappointed as everyone else to learn the former PM had secretly taken on the most important roles in cabinet. The fact he was secretly Finance Minister, when the finance department were apparently conducting an \u201cindependent\u201d inquiry into my matter, is very concerning. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.59am BST \n \n \n  2.35am BST  \n  \n  Wage increases in common interest for unions and employers, PM says \n  Asked, \u201cOn the enterprise bargaining reform, what do you think about the ACTU/BCA proposal?,\u201d Anthony Albanese says: \n   \n   Enterprise bargaining is not working. We know that is the case, wages haven\u2019t been keeping up with inflation and the difference between the new government and the old government is that the old government of the Coalition had a policy of putting downward pressure on wages. \n   They wanted low wages to be a key feature of the economic architecture. They fessed up on that. That is not the Labor government\u2019s approach. \n   We want to see wages increase over time and we want it to occur in a way that is cooperative. I see that there are common interests between unions and employers. It has been a theme of mine for a long, long period of time. It is a part of my philosophical view around the creation of Infrastructure Australia, the creation of jobs and skills Australia, how do we create that common purpose structures? \n   Enterprise bargaining is about employers and unions coming to common interest to benefit both and anything that can do that I see as very positive. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.55am BST \n \n \n  2.33am BST  \n  \n  PM stands by promise to reduce power prices \n  The questions have returned to policy. Anthony Albanese is asked if he is still committed to the campaign promise to cut electricity bills by $275: \n   \n   What occurred was that unbeknownst to the Australian public, again a lack of transparency, the government knew that wholesale prices were going to have considerable increases. \n   They deferred those increases until after the election campaign and then they went up. Our commitment is that because of our policies they will drive down energy prices. \n   We stand by the modelling which we released, which is that, from a business as usual, as the government \u2013 the former government was sitting there for a decade with no structure to encourage investment, where it was needed in renewables and at the same time as it was presiding over the closure of plants like Liddell, that it would reduce power prices our policy. \n   Our policy will reduce power prices and we stand by that and we stand by the modelling. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.54am BST \n \n \n  2.30am BST  \n  \n  Albanese commits to releasing solicitor general\u2019s advice  \n  The PM is asked if he thinks there should be a broader inquiry into this: \n   \n   Quite clearly, there are real questions to be answered here. There is a question of legality. There hasn\u2019t been a suggestion of illegality but there are \u2013 there have been questions raised about how this could occur, how it fits in with the conventions and the normal accountability mechanisms and checks and balances that are there in our parliamentary democracy. They are matters that need to be considered. \n   I will await and consider the advice properly. I will release it publicly. I am giving that commitment, so that everyone will have the opportunity to see the advice for themselves, but I would have thought that Australians are concerned that this could ever occur. \n   There is a basic fundamental weakness in checks and balances if no one knows who the minister is, then how can they be held to account for decisions which are made?  \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.53am BST \n \n \n  2.27am BST  \n Albanese to release legal advice on Morrison tomorrow after briefing this afternoon \n  \n  Anthony Albanese has just addressed the elephant in the room \u2013 the legal advice on Scott Morrison\u2019s secret ministries. \n   \n   I will be briefed by the secretary of my department, Glynn Davis, on the advice. My understanding is he has received the advice. I will be briefed on it this afternoon. I intend to release that advice so that people can see it and be transparent about it and we will, because my government, as an orderly government, we have cabinet meetings tomorrow.  \n   I think politeness and proper process means that they should have access to it. I will do that and I intend to release the advice tomorrow. As I said, I haven\u2019t had the opportunity, because I have been here, it came through while we were downstairs, so I will get briefed on it this afternoon at the commonwealth offices and then it will be considered, or released \u2013 I don\u2019t know that there is any decisions to be made, I am not sure because I haven\u2019t examined it yet, by the cabinet, but I will release it tomorrow in Canberra. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.52am BST \n \n \n  2.24am BST  \n  \n  All state and territory leaders to attend jobs and skills summit \n  Anthony Albanese is asked about NSW treasurer Matt Kean calling the summit unnecessary.

We want to work with all of the state and territory governments. I will ask Brendan to make some comments on this as well. We will have the day before the jobs and skills summit, we will have a meeting of the national cabinet.  \n   I have already had constructive discussions about this, including with Dominic Perrottet, and I know that all of the state and territory governments are concerned about the skills shortages. They are a handbrake on business activity and Daniel Andrews and Dominic Perrottet both wrote to me a little while ago and that is part of the context of having the jobs and skills summit, but I might ask Brendan to come and add some comments. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.50am BST \n \n \n  2.19am BST  \n  \n  Engagement with jobs and skills summit \u2018already a success\u2019, PM says \n  Anthony Albanese is taking questions. First one up asks him if he is worried that the jobs and skills summit could \u201cfizzle out like the Rudd summit did which recommended the Henry tax review, which wasn\u2019t a shining success\u201d. \n  Albanese responds: \n   \n   The Rudd 2020 summit was the first time anyone heard of the national disability insurance scheme. Pretty significant reform that came out of that process. \n   Already I regard it as a success. The fact that you are all here and we are talking about jobs and skills is part of the process of what we are doing here. Making sure that people understand that there are significant skills shortages. \n   If you look at the front page of every newspaper today, many of them are talking about skills shortages and about what is required. That is part of why we are calling the jobs and skills summit to provide that focus. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.26am BST \n \n \n  2.17am BST  \n  \n  \u2018It is really important for employers to get the skills they are crying out for\u2019 \n  The minister for skills and training, Brendan O\u2019Connor, has begun speaking: \n   \n   It is not a coincidence that the prime minister and this government wanted to introduce, as the first piece of legislation, the Jobs and Skills Australia. That is an independent body [to advise] the government as to what skills are in need now and what skills will be needed in the future. That will be advised and formed by employers and unions and universities in the VET sector, state and territory governments. \n   We want to make sure we are able to invest wisely in areas where there are skills shortages. We know the skills shortages are very significant across the economy, across the labour market, and so it\u2019s a priority of the Albanese government to invest in skills, invest in our own work force and invest in those students coming through. Along with, of course, dealing with the skilled migration pathways.

This is a great example of it. A business that has employed over the years hundreds of employees. A business that is well run, you can always tell because when you walk around, when people say to you, \u201cI have worked here for 40 years and 35 years,\u201d which is what we heard down stairs. \n   I want to acknowledge the presence of Senator Jacobi, one of the Oceania representatives in the Italian parliament, who has joined us here as well. \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.23am BST \n \n \n  2.10am BST  \n  \n  Albanese speaking  \n  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun to speak in what is a doorstop interview at a Sydney business. \n  He is spruiking Cerrone Jewellers in his electorate, which he says has hosted clients like Barbara Streisand and Celine Dion in Leichardt. \n  The visit highlights the start of Jobs and Skills Week, and is part of his government\u2019s promise of a \u201cfuture made in Australia.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 2.11am BST \n \n \n  2.07am BST  \n  \n  Ministers may administer other portfolios, footnote said \n  Last week Guardian Australia reported a wrinkle in the claim Scott Morrison had misled parliament about his multiple ministries. \n  After several reshuffles, Morrison presented lists of his ministry to parliament that omitted his double appointments, including one on 30 October 2020 claiming to be the \u201cfull ministry\u201d. \n  But, the lists contained a footnote that said: \n   \n   Ministers are sworn to administer the portfolio in which they are listed \u2026 and may also be sworn to administer other portfolios in which they are not listed. \n   \n  AAP is reporting today that Morrison\u2019s first ministry list, dated 28 August 2018, contained the disclaimer. That is more than 18 months before Morrison got his first extra ministry (health) in March 2020. \n  Before Morrison becoming prime minister the disclaimer was: \n   \n   As a general rule, there is one department in each portfolio. However, there is a Department of Human Services in the Social Services portfolio and a Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs in the Defence portfolio. The title of a department does not necessarily reflect the title of a minister in all cases. \n   \n  It is unclear if the disclaimer is related to secret multiple ministries or whether it is just more precise language to reflect administrative arrangements that ministers\u2019 responsibilities often overlap. \n  \n Updated at 2.22am BST \n \n \n  2.03am BST  \n Queensland records no Covid deaths and 383 people in hospital. \n  \n  There were 1,587 new cases in the last reporting period, and 11 people are in intensive care. \n   \n   \n    Today we have recorded 1,587 new COVID-19 cases.

For example, he said, reimbursement for expenses that were not actually occurred, or penalty rates for working unsociable hours of overtime or on weekends would have to be paid. Ferguson also called for a longer transition period. \n  \n Updated at 2.10am BST \n \n \n  1.42am BST  \n  \n  Inquiry into Queensland police calls for further submissions \n  The commission of inquiry into Queensland police responses to domestic violence is calling for further submissions after police service\u2019s commissioner Katarina Carroll\u2019s evidence last week. \n   \n   \n    #BREAKING: Commission of inquiry into Qld police responses to domestic violence calls for further submissions \"from people who have knowledge of the cultural issues within the QPS\" after police commissioner Katarina Carroll's evidence last week. pic.twitter.com/kuwLQdPFm7\u2014 Eden Gillespie (@edengillespie) August 22, 2022\n    \n   \n  This latest news comes from Guardian\u2019s Queensland reporter Eden Gillespie.

The pair say in a joint statement: \n   \n   With the increasingly widespread proliferation of crypto assets \u2013 to the extent that crypto advertisements can be seen plastered all over big sporting events \u2013 we need to make sure customers engaging with crypto are adequately informed and protected. \n   The previous government dabbled in crypto asset regulation but prematurely jumped straight to options without first understanding what was being regulated. The Albanese Government is taking a more serious approach to work out what is in the ecosystem and what risks need to be looked at first. \n   \n  A public consultation paper on token mapping will be released soon. \n  \n Updated at 11.41pm BST \n \n \n  11.28pm BST  \n  \n  Husic defends parliamentarians deciding on grants \n  On ABC Radio this morning both minister for industry Ed Husic and Liberal MP Bridget Archer were asked about the Grattan Institute\u2019s report about pork barrelling. \n  Husic was wary of taking ministerial discretion away on grants and leaving it up to the bureaucrats:\"  \n   \n   I think parliamentarians are elected to represent both community and national interest.

Australians are also more pessimistic about an invasion of Taiwan compared with those who live there \u2013 one in four respondents believed China would move on Taiwan \u201csoon\u201d. Both groups were on the same page though when it came to the US and China working out any grievances peacefully. \n  Allan Behm, the director of the Australia Institute\u2019s international and security affairs program and a former senior foreign affairs, attorney general\u2019s and defence official said the more \u201cthe anti-China lobby beats the drums of war, the more afraid of China Australians become\u201d. \n  The rhetoric on China and the \u201cfearmongering\u201d was impacting public opinion. He said: \n   \n   It is astonishing that Australians are more afraid of an attack from China than the Taiwanese are. \n   The results show popular opinion is detached from geopolitical and geostrategic reality. The results support the case for a reset in the Australia-China relationship and the manner in which we hold this important national conversation. Such a reset should be based on facts and the national interest rather than the fear peddling we saw in the recent Australian federal election by some for domestic, partisan interests. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.35am BST \n \n \n  10.26pm BST  \n Good morning! \n  \n  Solicitor general Stephen Donaghue is set to hand down the much-anticipated legal advice regarding former prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s secret ministerial appointments. \n  Prime minister Anthony Albanese will receive the advice about whether Morrison breached any rules after he secretly appointed himself to five portfolios. \n  But before Albanese receives this advice he is also flagging a separate investigation into Morrison\u2019s actions, telling Sky News yesterday that there was \u201ca need for proper scrutiny of what occurred\u201d. \n  Liberal MP Bridget Archer has also told the ABC she believes there is need for further investigation or an inquiry. \n  In employment news, the government has released a list of the top 10 in-demand professions over the next five years in the lead-up to the jobs and skills summit next week. \n  The list is based on the skills priority list, data on job vacancies and projected growth in employment, and the roles include nurses, construction managers and chefs. \n  Let\u2019s get going. \n  \n Updated at 10.36pm BST \n", "Nation records 26 Covid deaths as pre-flight Covid testing for international arrivals scrapped \u2013 as it happened [2022-03-25T07:38:50Z]": "  7.30am GMT    The day that was, Friday 25 March    We will wrap up the blog for Friday now.

Updated at 7.38am GMT     7.16am GMT       A federal parliamentary committee has called on universities to train students and staff on foreign interference, and provide \u201ctransparency\u201d on the risks, AAP reports. A body should be established to crack down on the intimidation of students on-campus and the reporting of higher education staff and students to foreign embassies, under recommendations made by the intelligence and security committee. This body should urgently provide clear guidelines to universities on how to introduce penalties for instances of foreign interference on campuses. The inquiry looked at safeguarding taxpayer funded research and student safety on campus. The recommendations are targeted at securing sensitive, taxpayer-funded research and protecting student safety on campus. Recorded incidents of harassment, intimidation, and censorship due to foreign interference on higher education campuses would be published in a report each year \u2013 and would include the response taken by the university. Universities that choose to have Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes \u2013 language and culture centres \u2013 would be required to publicly disclose funding arrangements and the details of the agreements. They should also be able to have the \u201cfinal say\u2019\u2019 about the appointment of staff and curriculum content, and that robust academic freedom and free speech clauses be included in any agreement. The committee chair, James Paterson, said more work needed to be done to protect research and students. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that students and academics have faced a sustained campaign of intimidation, harassment, censorship and intelligence gathering by foreign state governments,\u201d Paterson said. \u201cThis resulted in the transfer of sensitive research to authoritarian regimes and their militaries and threats to the safety of domestic and international students.\u201d The foreign affairs minister has been asked to decide whether to dump a $10m contract between Monash University and Comac, a Chinese government-owned aviation company that has been sanctioned by the US. Sophie McNeill, a Human Rights Watch Australia researcher, said the measures ensured universities have \u201cclear policies in place to counter state-backed harassment and intimidation\u201d. The committee also recommended banning employees of government departments and agencies from participating in talent-recruitment programs.    Updated at 7.27am GMT     7.09am GMT       The foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the minister for international development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, have just put out this joint statement regarding the draft security agreement between China and Solomon Islands. They said:  Australia is aware of the proposed draft security cooperation agreement between China and Solomon Islands. We respect the right of every Pacific country to make sovereign decisions. We have regularly and respectfully raised our concerns with the Solomon Islands government and will continue to do so.  We would be particularly concerned by any actions that undermine the stability and security of our region, including the establishment of a permanent presence such as a military base.  The pair go on to point out Australia extended its defence support in Solomon Islands until December 2023 and is building an integrated emergency services radio network across Solomon Islands, as well as a second patrol boat outpost. The government has said $22m is also being provided to fund salaries for essential workers on Solomon Islands.

The student-led climate strikes took place in cities, suburbs and regional towns across Australia, and aimed to call on the federal government to divert funding away from coal and gas projects and to clean, renewable energy. Much of the attention of Friday\u2019s strike was directed at Prime Minister Scott Morrison, with a large crowd of protesters arriving at Kirribilli just before lunchtime. Organisers estimate the crowd swelled to about 3000, and NSW Police said there were about one thousand demonstrators there. \u201cIt was great to see so many people turn up to Scott Morrison\u2019s house, to really bring home the message that we need climate action,\u201d student Owen Magee told AAP. \u201cIt was very full and packed. \u201cThere was people as far as you could see around the streets around Scott Morrison\u2019s house.\u201d One student Ella O\u2019Dwyer-Oshlack lost her home in the devastating Lismore floods, and addressed the crowd. \u201cMy home was flooded and our whole town is a mess,\u201d the 13-year-old said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to go back to my school since it was flooded. \u201cWhy is the federal government still giving money to fossil fuel companies?

The Centre for Public Integrity on Friday released a discussion paper titled Integrity inadequacies: Victoria, which details how the state\u2019s frameworks are falling short when compared to other jurisdictions. It said that despite substantial improvements to Victoria\u2019s donations laws introduced in 2018, which require donations over $1,050 to be disclosed and capped at $4,210 over four years, the definition is too narrow.

Shayla was last seen about 2.30pm on Wednesday near Stormlea Road in Stormlea, wearing pink leggings, a cream top, and gumboots. She has spent two nights in the remote area where temperatures dropped to 11 degrees. Police say she had been playing outside with dogs from a neighbouring property.When her mother went to check on her after about half an hour, Shayla and the dogs were gone. One of the dogs was found about 7pm on Wednesday, 800 metres from where Shayla was last seen. Police did not believe there was anything suspicious about the disappearance and there was no person of interest. Significant resources, including thermal imaging drones and sniffer dogs from Victoria Police, were involved in the search operation.

He says NZ was not aware of the deal, and says New Zealand, like Australia, has a defence force presence on the Solomon Islands. He says the deployment has been extended for the next few months. Henare is meeting today with his Australian counterpart, Peter Dutton, and he says that security in the Pacific is an important topic of discussion. He said:  I think the most important thing to me as Minister of Defence for the New Zealand government is to have a wider context and a wider view of security in the Pacific, and this is one of the matters that I am looking forward to discussing with Minister Dutton very shortly, and it\u2019s something that we have made a priority in New Zealand and we will look towards the security across the entire Pacific and the Solomon Islands plays a key part.  He says he also wants to compare notes with Dutton about the defence force response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and also how to regenerate the workforce.       5.11am GMT       Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja is on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing and is asked about the reports of a security deal between China and the Solomon Islands. He says the Australian government is \u201cobviously concerned by the words in the draft agreement\u201d and these concerns are being raised with the Solomon Islands, but he says the Australian government is working very closely with the Solomon Islands government. He says the Australian government doesn\u2019t \u201csee a role for an authoritarian regime to be obviously coming in to a security environment\u201d in the Pacific region.   That is something that is very important to Australia, to our interests but to the interests of the broader Pacific.  He disagrees that Australia has been \u201coutfoxed\u201d by China.  I don\u2019t think you should draw that conclusion. As you say, it is a draft agreement and they will be discussions taking place between our government, the Australian government and Solomon Islands government and amongst Pacific counterparts, the Pacific family.  As I say and I will repeat, the Pacific family comes together in these circumstances. We work well together. We don\u2019t see the need in a security environment to go beyond that and I think it does potentially have implications and we will see significant pushback in the region I think.

Top defamation lawyer Sue Chrysanthou, who spoke against the proposed legislation earlier this month, said in a written follow up statement that anonymous users on Twitter and Facebook are less likely to be subject to defamation action. She says regarding Twitter, the nature of the platform is the identity of the tweeter is central to the publication.  Generally, no one pays any heed to anonymous Tweets; and anonymous Tweets will not feed automatically into many people\u2019s Twitter feeds (due to lack of followers).   On Facebook, she says posts are rarely anonymous - \u201cpeople usually post to let their views be known to those who know them\u201d  Where anonymous posts occur on Facebook pages maintained by large organisations (eg the media Facebook pages involved in [the Voller case]), the natural (and sufficient) response is to pursue the media organisation, rather than the individual \u201ctroll\u201d.  She says regarding Instagram \u201canonymity is the antithesis of nearly most activity on this platform.\u201d Chrysanthou says tweets and Facebook posts have often been the subject of concerns notices and defamation proceedings, but they\u2019re rarely brought against anonymous accounts, where they might be for Google reviews, because of the reputation damage associated.        4.19am GMT       Labor MP Andrew Leigh says he was granted a personal protection order this week by the ACT Magistrates\u2019 Court.

She said:  Such an agreement would have serious implications for Australia and for our shared region. It also raises serious concerns about the Morrison government\u2019s Pacific step up. Australia should be the partner of choice for our Pacific partners to address shared challenges. The Morrison government needs to explain the implications of the reported arrangement and how it plans to respond. Labor is seeking a briefing on these matters. Labor respects the right of the people and the government of the Solomon Islands to make sovereign decisions about its security. The Pacific family has shown we can provide effective and sustainable support to the Solomon Islands in times of need - and we hope to see this continue.     Updated at 3.52am GMT     3.43am GMT    South Australia records four Covid-19 deaths    South Australia has reported 4,549 new Covid-19 cases and four deaths, including a man in his 30s. There are 157 people in hospital, including six in intensive care.       3.36am GMT       Melbourne researchers have created two new Covid-19 vaccines which could provide better immunity to the virus than any other vaccination in the world, AAP reports. More than 100 Victorians, aged 18 to 70, are being recruited to participate in a trial for the Melbourne-made RBD protein vaccine and RBD mRNA vaccine. The new jabs, created by scientists from the Doherty Institute and Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, are distinct from all existing vaccines. They focus on the immune response on the tip of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, called the receptor binding domain. The RBD enables the virus to enter and infect cells in the body and can elicit more than 90% of neutralising antibodies to block the virus following infection. The vaccines may also provide immunity to the Omicron variant and more serious future variants, as they are \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d variant vaccines. \u201cAs well as inducing strong neutralising antibody immunity to the Beta variant in mice, it also retains its potential to neutralise the original ancestral strain, and preliminary in-lab studies have demonstrated neutralising activity against other variants including Delta and Omicron,\u201d Doherty Institute researcher Georgia Deliyannis said. She said the RBD protein vaccine protected against Covid-19 in a mouse even 100 days after it was given the jab. Doherty Institute Director Sharon Lewin said the emergence of new Covid-19 variants showed the need for the next generation of vaccines. \u201cBoth vaccines are efficient to produce and can be rapidly modified to incorporate distinct or multiple RBD mutations arising in future variants,\u201d she said. \u201cIn addition, Australia needs the ability to manufacture its own vaccines to ensure our own supply should future global shortages occur, and to contribute to the global need for Covid-19 vaccines.\u201d Some 114 volunteers are needed to participate in trials to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of the vaccines as a fourth Covid-19 dose. Participants must have had their third dose at least three months prior to the study commencing. People who have been infected with Covid-19 are eligible so long as it\u2019s been at least three months since infection and they\u2019ve received a third dose.       3.22am GMT       Some more photos from the climate striking students across Australia.    my new personal hero  #ClimateStrike #PeopleNotProfit pic.twitter.com/KUts344s6h&mdash; mich \u2728 (@mismatchedmich) March 25, 2022      A few more pics from today\u2019s #ClimateStrike in Sydney. @StrikeClimate @TogetherWeCanOz #TogetherWeCan #auspol #ClimateActionNow #ss4c pic.twitter.com/pamzR5IB3r&mdash; Australian Conservation Foundation (@AusConservation) March 25, 2022      Some great moments at the #Schoolstrike4climate today. @CentralNewsUTS #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/mUaT9nsFlu&mdash; James Fitzgerald Sice (@FitzgeraldSice) March 25, 2022         3.15am GMT       Queensland will not introduce new restrictions, as authorities say they are not sure when the current wave of Covid-19 cases will peak, AAP reports. The current wave is largely the result of the BA2 Omicron variant and although its arrival is earlier than predicted, chief health officer John Gerrard says it\u2019s not unexpected. \u201cThere is no clear indication at this stage stage when this wave will peak, it\u2019s a bit too early, we haven\u2019t got enough data (but) it will be some time in April,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known that there will be further waves, this will be the future for months and years to come, and we\u2019re not going to overreact every time there is another wave of the virus.\u201d Covid-19 infections had increased by 54% from a baseline two weeks ago, and about one in 50 school-aged children had tested positive in the past week, Gerrard said. Just under half of recent cases are from the same household as a known infection, and about one in four PCR tests are returning a positive result. While virus hospital numbers haven\u2019t increased, health minister Yvette D\u2019Ath said the number of staff off work because they were Covid-19 positive or needing to quarantine was having an impact on the health system. More than 2400 health workers are furloughed, up from about 1600 at the start of the week.       3.10am GMT       Peters Ice Cream has been ordered to pay $12m in penalties by the federal court for anti-competitive conduct in relation to selling ice creams at petrol stations and convenience stores. Peters, the company behind Connoisseur, Drumstick, Maxibon and Frosty Fruits, admitted that between November 2014 and December 2019, its distributor PFD Food Services agreed to not sell or distribute competitors\u2019 products without consent from Peters Ice Cream. Peters admitted it had engaged in exclusive dealing conduct that likely lessened competition in the ice cream market.  ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the case was important.   We took this action because we were concerned that Peters Ice Cream\u2019s conduct could reduce competition in this market and impact on the choice of single serve ice creams available to consumers. Peters Ice Cream admitted, that if PFD had not been restricted from distributing other manufacturers\u2019 ice cream products, it was likely that one or more potential competitors would have entered or expanded in this market.  The ACCC said potential competitors include Bulla, Gelativo and Pure Pops. Peters was also ordered to establish a compliance program for three years, and pay the ACCC\u2019s legal costs.        3.04am GMT    WA records two Covid-19 deaths    AAP has the latest on the new Covid-19 cases in Western Australia. More free Covid-19 tests are being rolled out across regional Western Australia as the state records a further 8,133 infections and two deaths. WA Health on Friday said two men in their 70s and 80s had died with the virus earlier in the week. There were 209 people in hospital including 10 in intensive care. A further 180,000 free rapid antigen tests are being distributed across regional and remote WA. People in remote communities will receive 20 free RATs per household, which will be handed out at shopping centres and distributed by local Aboriginal organisations and members of parliament. Other households are eligible to receive 15 free tests.       2.58am GMT       Finally, Morrison was asked about the climate strike being undertaken by school children in capital cities around Australia. He said his message is the government has taken climate change seriously, but claims they might be being told by \u201cmany people with other agendas\u201d that the government hasn\u2019t reduced emissions by around 20%. He seems to be blaming what the children are being taught:  And I think it\u2019s important as young people are growing up, and have an understandable keen interest in this issue because it affects their futures, but I would encourage them to understand that Australia, contrary to what they might be being told by many people with other agendas, Australia is reducing its emissions by around 20%.  They probably might not know that Australia has reduced its emissions by more than New Zealand, by more than Canada, by more than the United States, by more than Japan, more than many countries in Europe.  They might not know that because they\u2019ve probably only ever been told that Australia isn\u2019t doing these things. But the opposite is true. What is true is that, as a country, we\u2019re taking these issues very seriously and we\u2019re doing things about it that actually reduce emissions.   He repeats his previous comments that it\u2019s about resilience and adaptation, that recent floods and weather events are not as a result of something in the past few years but for \u201cdecades and decades and decades\u201d.  As I said a few weeks ago, Australia is a harder country to live in now because of these changes, but those changes haven\u2019t been caused by a couple of years or even 10 years.  He says it is great the children are expressing their view, and then pivots to discussing the need for reducing emissions with technological advances, and also the need for other countries to do so, too.  It\u2019s not enough for Australia to achieve net zero by 2050. The whole world has to. And so if emissions are continuing to rise, be it in China or in Indonesia or Vietnam or South America, all these places, well, the world continues to get hotter. And so the solution, we believe, is technology that those countries can embrace at a cost that enables their countries to continue to develop and give their citizens jobs. You know, dealing with climate change is not just an advanced economy\u2019s challenge, it is a global challenge.   He finishes by saying those protesting should focus on the \u201cpractical\u201d changes.  So, I respect their voice, I respect their opportunity to raise their voices, but I would encourage them to look at these many other issues. Because if you want to see climate action undertaken, then they\u2019re the practical things that you need to do.        2.47am GMT       Morrison says the Australian government wasn\u2019t blindsided by the Solomon Islands security deal with China, and says he has been in communications with the Solomon Islands. He said:  Not in the last 24 hours. There\u2019s dialogue that\u2019s taking place there. But we deal with these issues as family and we work them through. As you know, we have Australian Federal Police in Solomon Islands right now, guaranteeing the peace and security of the Solomon Islands right now. And the reason we\u2019re there is because Monasa called me and asked me and said, \u201cScott, can you please send us support to ensure we can stabilise the situation here in the Solomon Islands?\u201d I visited their constabulary and thanked them for the tremendous work they\u2019ve done in Honiara. It is a tremendous partnership.        2.44am GMT       And just regarding Senator Rex Patrick\u2019s future, he confirms he is considering whether to run again in the Senate or in the seat of Grey in the House of Representatives. He says he won\u2019t make an announcement today.    I&#39;ve been having many conversations about whether I should press on campaigning for a SA Senate seat or run for the Federal seat of Grey. I&#39;m thinking hard about what&#39;s best for SA. I won&#39;t be making a big announcement today, but I&#39;ll declare my intentions very soon. #auspol&mdash; Rex Patrick (@Senator_Patrick) March 25, 2022         2.43am GMT       Back to Scott Morrison for a bit. On China\u2019s influence in the Pacific region compared to Australia\u2019s, Morrison says the Australian government has increased investment in the region by 50%. He said:  We increased it from around $1.12bn, I think, up to $1.7bn. And this was part of our Pacific \u201cStep-up\u201d program. We melded that with our maritime security program, providing patrol boats into the Pacific, so they can protect and support their own ocean territories.  We are the single largest provider of development assistance into the Pacific. ... And through the course of the pandemic in particular, that has been our first and primary focus beyond our own shores.  And so whether it be Frank Bainimarama [prime minister of Fiji] \u2013 I would speak to Pacific leaders or be in text contact with leaders almost every day, and certainly every week \u2013 and we are constantly in discussions about the many challenges they face. Whether it\u2019s the volcanic explosion in Tonga recently, whether it was the measles epidemic that we saw up in Samoa, where we sent in our medical teams. Whether it has been the many challenges we\u2019ve faced up in Papua New Guinea.  And even now the training bases for emergency service operators and those involved in peacekeeping missions up there near Lautoko, the Black Rock facility we put in Fiji. The Pacific finance initiatives, some $1.5bn. We have led in the Pacific.  Morrison says there is a \u201cconstant pressure\u201d in the region that is not aligned with Australia\u2019s interests, but that\u2019s why the government is investing in the region in telecommunications and electricity infrastructure, among other projects.    Updated at 2.50am GMT     2.37am GMT       Independent senator Rex Patrick was due to announce his future plans today given Nick Xenophon is planning to run for the Senate again. There\u2019s no announcement yet but there is this. I am not sure what it means yet. Perhaps running in the seat of Grey?    \ud83e\udd14 #auspol pic.twitter.com/SOQnSbe9gQ&mdash; Rex Patrick (@Senator_Patrick) March 25, 2022      Updated at 2.38am GMT     2.29am GMT       Here\u2019s more on today\u2019s funding announcements from my colleague Josh Butler.   Related: Coalition pledges to build endometriosis centres and expand free genetic testing for parents         2.22am GMT       The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Sydney and greater Wollongong.

Heavy rainfall in these severe thunderstorms is likely to lead to flash flooding and people should continue to monitor warnings at: https://t.co/Ss766eSCrL pic.twitter.com/wWF85DJYqE&mdash; Bureau of Meteorology, New South Wales (@BOM_NSW) March 25, 2022         2.20am GMT       The Liberal member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint, has been campaigning on the issue of endometriosis after being diagnosed in early 2020 and says the funding announced today for pain clinics will be a game changer. She said:  When you have proper holistic care for endo, which is what we\u2019ll be supporting women and girls around the nation to achieve, you can have a great life and a very fulfilling life, and a largely pain-free life for so many women.  She also pays tribute to the former Labor MP Gai Brodtmann, who is also at the announcement campaigning with her on the issue.    Updated at 2.22am GMT     2.16am GMT    $81m funding for Medicare support for genetic testing    The second announcement the prime minister is making today is for Medicare-supported testing for genetic conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy. Morrison tears up when he recalled how his wife Jenny asked him to go to a forum on spinal muscular atrophy to hear the stories:  And I did what any man in that situation would do and just said, \u201cYes.\u201d And I\u2019m glad I did. I walked in the back and I sat at the back of the room quietly, and I just listened to heartbreaking story after heartbreaking story. And I walked out of there and I said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do something about this.\u201d  And [we] linked up with Greg Hunt and we began that trial program that provided for the clinical testing of couples looking to have children who would have been going through the very things I\u2019ve just been talking about often as well.   Morrison says the trial has been incredibly effective.   And so we put Mackenzie\u2019s Mission to work and it\u2019s done its work, and it\u2019s proved to be incredibly effective. And so today we\u2019re announcing that we will help couples plan for their pregnancy by investing $81.2m to create a new Medicare item to support access to genetic testing for three serious genetic conditions. And they are, of course, spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis, and for fragile X syndrome.     Updated at 2.19am GMT     2.10am GMT       Morrison says the funding includes $16.4m for specialised pain clinics, to provide support for women and girls on how to manage endometriosis, and get the right advice.  It will also include support for the endometriosis management plan, clinical scientific trials, and clinical practice guidelines.       2.07am GMT    PM pledges $58m for endometriosis care and treatment    The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is holding a press conference to announce the Coalition\u2019s plan to fund care and treatment for endometriosis for $58m in the budget next week. His wife, Jenny Morrison, was on the Today Show this morning to talk about her own experience with it, and Morrison references that:  When it came to our own journey, when Jenny was a mid-teen all the way through to her mid-20s, it wasn\u2019t until then that she learned she was suffering from endometriosis. Jenny has told her story over the last 24 hours. And I want to thank her, and I know everyone around me thanks Jenny for doing that.  She told the story of crippling and terrible pain. And I knew it, because Jenny and I started going out when I was 16. And she lived through that and she\u2019s incredibly tough. I know that personally. But this was the most awful thing to see someone you love going through every single month.  He says it impacts one in nine women and girls, and they suffer: \u201cI can\u2019t underscore that more strongly\u201d. He said:  And so what today is about is saying to all Australians, and talking to them about their dream of having children, their dream of trying to live a life which is pain-free, or as pain-free as you can make it, and being able to live with conditions like endometriosis, and to be able to manage that pain, going about your life, about not having to plan your entire day about how you manage endometriosis. About the sort of jobs you can have, the sort of holidays you can go... Whether you can go out at night, whether you can see your friends, or, you know, whether you can even go and exercise. And ultimately about whether you can have children or not, what sort of job you can choose to have because you have to think about how you\u2019re going to manage that condition.     Updated at 2.14am GMT     1.55am GMT       Queensland has recorded a fourth human case of Japanese encephalitis (JEV), taking Australia\u2019s total number of known or probable cases to 32, AAP reports. Queensland Health had listed four virus cases as of Monday, but the latest case wasn\u2019t widely publicised like previous cases. The patient has been listed in Brisbane\u2019s Metro North Hospital and Health Service for the week starting 7 March. Another human Japanese encephalitis case has also been listed in that region, while two are listed in the state\u2019s southwest. Queensland Health did not comment on the new case or about the condition of the state\u2019s four Japanese encephalitis cases, but stressed that people should not be alarmed by the mosquito-borne virus. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be vigilant, but not alarmed, by recent cases of Japanese encephalitis,\u201d a spokesperson said on Friday. \u201cMost people infected by Japanese encephalitis virus will experience mild symptoms, such as a headache and fever. Only in rare cases will JEV can cause serious illness.\u201d \u201cGiven recent flooding, it is expected mosquito numbers will increase across Queensland. \u201cQueenslanders are urged to protect themselves by taking steps to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes and removing mosquito breeding sites on their properties.\u201d Australia has 32 confirmed or probable Japanese encephalitis cases in humans: 11 in Victoria, nine in NSW, eight in South Australia and four in Queensland. One case in NSW, another in Victoria and a third in SA have been fatal.    Updated at 2.02am GMT     1.47am GMT       The climate strike protests are getting underway.

Diana Asmar, the Health Workers Union secretary and ally of late senator Kimberley Kitching, and a group of Victorian unions on Friday sought to expedite their application for special leave to appeal the takeover.  Labor will have until 28 March to make submissions to the high court, with the unions to reply by noon the following day.  No date has been set for the hearing.  The Victorian ALP was placed under control of the national executive following allegations of branch stacking. It means rank-and-file members have been unable to vote in preselections for two years.  The takeover has twice been upheld by the Victorian supreme court and Victorian court of appeal.       1.33am GMT    National Covid update    Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 26 deaths from Covid-19: ACT  Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,122 In hospital: 42 (with 3 people in ICU)  NSW  Deaths: 7 Cases: 23,702 In hospital: 1,182 (with 43 people in ICU)  Queensland  Deaths: 3 Cases: 9,730 In hospital: 265 (with 14 people in ICU)  South Australia  Deaths: 4 Cases: 4,549 In hospital: 157 (with 6 people in ICU)  Tasmania  Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,786 In hospital: 2 (with xx people in ICU)  Victoria  Deaths: 9 Cases: 9,244 In hospital: 253 (with 19 people in ICU)  Western Australia  Deaths: 2 Cases: 8,133 In hospital: 209 (with 10 people in ICU)     Updated at 4.31am GMT     1.27am GMT       And with that I will hand the blog over to the ever-capable Josh Taylor. Thanks for reading.        1.24am GMT       I wanted to return to discussions around the Solomon Islands and China, with the former opposition leader, Bill Shorten, saying the government \u201chas been asleep at the wheel.\u201d Shorten was on the Today show this morning where he ripped into the government, saying of the leaked report showing China is finalising a security deal with Solomon Islands:   Australia should be the partner of choice for Pacific nations. The Morrison government has been asleep at the wheel.  I think this is a major foreign policy blunder and that, when we\u2019ve got these sort of agreements being signed in our backyard, that\u2019s the day job of the Morrison government - they keep polishing their Defence credentials. Well, I\u2019m afraid this one\u2019s gonna hang around for a very long time, and it\u2019s a miss.      Updated at 1.29am GMT     1.14am GMT       The former Victorian Liberal premier, Denis Napthine, has been appointed as the new chair of the National Disability Insurance Agency.  The NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, confirmed the appointment in a media release on Friday.  The appointment was made despite fury from federal and state Labor when it was proposed last month.  Reynolds said in her statement:   Dr Napthine is an eminently qualified Australian with the passion, commitment, leadership and experience to ensure the NDIS continues to deliver on its promise to people with disability, their families and carers. As premier of Victoria in 2013, it was Dr Napthine that reached agreement with the Gillard Labor government to establish the NDIS in his state. As the father of a son with disability, Dr Napthine also brings very personal lived experience to this crucial role. Through his work with local and regional disability services, which includes hands-on experience as a direct care provider, Dr Napthine has shown his commitment to making tangible improvements to the lives of people with disabilities.  Labor\u2019s NDIS spokesman, Bill Shorten, said last month the proposed appointment of Napthine was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.  Napthine will be in the role for three years. He was added to the role in January along with Leah van Poppel, Dr Peta Seaton and Meredith Allan. Napthine takes over from James Minto, who was acting in the role after Helen Nugent stepped down from the role at the end of 2021.  The government has previously been criticised over a failure to appoint a person with disability as chair of the agency.

Unfortunately, the meteorological signs aren\u2019t calming, with the return of heavy rain possible, even \u201csuper cells\u201d of thunderstorms, to a large swathe of the NSW coast.

The application to the high court was fast-tracked, and Albanese called it an \u201cappeal of an appeal\u201d:    This is... an appeal of an appeal. There are some people who have made decisions some time ago, they went to court, they lost. They then sought to arrange some costs, they lost. They then appealed that decision, they lost. Now they are appealing before the high court. We have a legal system where people are entitled to do that. People will make their own judgements about the merits of that up to this point in time, the courts have made a judgement on the merits of the cases and have been very clear in their decisions. It will be heard today. I obviously don\u2019t make any comments about the specific, given that by definition, the court hearing is today.

When it comes to these issues, it is important that you deal with the facts and that we have appropriate briefings and I will be receiving those on Monday. But I would very much seek to have cooperative relationships with the Pacific.  It certainly is an issue that has serious implications for Australia. And there is a need for the government too, as always, make sure that Australia\u2019s interest I represented while, of course, respecting other sovereign nations and their right to make decisions. It\u2019s important that Australia be engaged on these issues, given there are implications for Australia.

In reasons released today, we find that chief justice Susan Kiefel, justices Patrick Keane and Stephen Gageler would have struck down the law \u2013 but were overruled by the majority. CJ Kiefel and Justice Keane said the laws \u201crestrict or distort the choice presented to an elector\u201d by not allowing parties to use their proper name on the ballot paper, which is \u201cnot compatible with the irreducible minimum requirement of the constitution that the choice presented to electors be an informed choice\u201d. They said:  No substantial reason is shown for the significant impairment that the impugned provisions effect on the choice of electors; their significant burden on the freedom cannot be justified.  Gageler, similarly, said the commonwealth had not shown a \u201cmeaningful risk of confusion\u201d to justify the law. But justices Michelle Gordon, James Edelman and Jacqueline Gleeson found there was \u201csignificant confusion\u201d of voters in 2013, when Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm was elected for the Senate in NSW. In a technical judgment, they found the Liberal Democrats had failed to prove sufficient facts to conclude that voter choice had been impeded. Justice Simon Steward agreed, finding although the law may be considered \u201cheavy-handed\u201d the court \u201chas traditionally deferred to the legislative branch in the case of laws regulating federal elections\u201d and only \u201cextreme laws\u201d dismantling Australian democracy should be struck down. He also referred to an earlier judgment in which he claimed the implied freedom of political communication may not be settled law in Australia.

Updated at 12.15am GMT     11.33pm GMT    Pre-flight Covid tests for international arrivals to be scrapped    Just returning to health minister Greg Hunt\u2019s media conference this morning, he also announced the government\u2019s biosecurity emergency determination will not be renewed after 17 April, when the determination expires.  That means international travellers won\u2019t have any pre-departure testing requirements anymore. It also means restrictions on cruise ships and anti-price gouging penalties for rapid antigen tests will end. The health minister will also lose certain powers. However, arrivals to Australia will still need to be vaccinated and wear masks on flights.  Hunt said the move would mean there would be no need for pre-flight testing for arrivals into Australia.    The country is ready to move on from the emergency declaration made two years and one month ago. I will not be renewing the biosecurity emergency determination. That\u2019s on strong advice from Prof Kelly and our other medical advisers; the unanimous advice that was given to me and discussed with the national security committee of cabinet.     Updated at 11.43pm GMT     11.16pm GMT       Back at the Beetaloo inquiry, Origin says that Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, now on Australia\u2019s sanctions list, is not certain to profit from its planned fracking project in the Northern Territory. The Origin general manager for government engagement, Tim O\u2019Grady, said the fracking project may not even proceed and was still years away from production. That made it uncertain whether Vekselberg, who holds a stake in Origin\u2019s joint venture partner in the Beetaloo, would make any money from the project.   I wouldn\u2019t be certain that if the project did proceed to production, Mr Vekselberg would be a financial beneficiary.   Origin initially resisted appearing before the inquiry. It had to be compelled by the Senate committee. O\u2019Grady is asked why Origin did not want to appear. He says the inquiry was initially focussed on a government grant scheme, designed to encourage exploration in the Beetaloo Basin. Origin did not apply for that funding, he said.   Origin saw the main focus of this inquiry being the cooperative funding grant, and given we are not party to that funding, we chose initially to submit to the inquiry and appear at the inquiry through the peak industry body, Appea. Given the inquiry\u2019s as you say quite insistence that we do appear, we are happy always to stand up to scrutiny on our activities and I\u2019m glad we are now here in front of you responding to your questions.

The government has also imposed sanctions on 22 Russian propagandists and disinformation operatives, including senior editors of state broadcaster Russia Today.      Foreign minister Marise Payne said the latest round of sanctions against the Belarus president was due to the country providing strategic support to Russia. \u201cThe Belarusian government allowed Russian military forces to train in their country for weeks ahead of the invasion,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cSince then, it has allowed Russia to fire ballistic missiles from Belarus into Ukraine, enabled the transport of Russian military personnel, heavy weapons and tanks into Ukraine, provided refuelling points in Belarus for Russian military aircraft and stored Russian weapons and military equipment.\u201d The Belarusian sanctions will also apply to the president\u2019s son, Viktor Lukashenko, and first lady Galina Lukashenko. There are now sanctions against 32 pro-Kremlin propagandists, including editors from the Strategic Culture Foundation, InfoRos and NewsFront. \u201cThese latest steps, one month into Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, continue our focused efforts to ensure that Russia and those who support its illegal, unprovoked invasion of its democratic neighbour, pay a high cost,\u201d Senator Payne said. \u201cThe Australian government reiterates our unwavering support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and for the people of Ukraine.\u201d     Updated at 11.23pm GMT     10.49pm GMT       Diana Asmar, the Health Workers Union secretary and ally of late senator Kimberley Kitching, and a group of Victorian unions are again seeking to challenge the federal takeover of the Victorian Labor branch. The national executive\u2019s takeover, triggered by allegations of branch-stacking, has twice been upheld by the Victorian supreme court and Victorian court of appeal. There is no automatic right to appeal to the high court in this type of case, so Asmar and her allies will need leave to appeal.The high court has confirmed that at noon today it will hold a hearing to consider a request to expedite the hearing of a special leave application.    Updated at 11.25pm GMT     10.47pm GMT       A Senate inquiry is again exploring plans to frack the Northern Territory\u2019s Beetaloo Basin. This morning\u2019s hearing in Canberra will be closely watched, because Origin Energy, which is seeking to frack the region, is tied up with a Russian oligarch now on Australia\u2019s sanctions list, Viktor Vekselberg. Origin\u2019s planned Beetaloo project is in a joint venture with a company named Falcon Oil and Gas. Vekselberg, through a holding company, has a 16% stake in Falcon. Origin\u2019s general manager for government engagement, Tim O\u2019Grady, revealed this morning that the company had sought advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about what it should do, now that Vekselberg is on the sanctions list. He says Origin is still waiting on that advice, but will be \u201cvery happy\u201d to comply with whatever the department says. O\u2019Grady says Origin has no direct relationship with Vekselberg. He is also asked why Origin chose to get involved with Falcon, given Vekselberg has been on a US sanctions list since 2018. He says:  There is an interest from Mr Vekselberg, but it is a passive interest. We were aware of the sanctions on Mr Vekselberg from the US back in 2018. And at that time our actions took greater control of the project to Origin and we were happy to distance ourselves from Mr Vekselberg. And we were aware a few days ago that Mr Vekselberg was designated on the Australian sanction list and we promptly contacted the department of foreign affairs and trade for advice on what actions, if any, Origin should take after this new development.      Updated at 11.19pm GMT     10.33pm GMT    Greg Hunt announces Atagi advice on fourth jab    Health minister Greg Hunt has been speaking to the media on the Gold Coast this morning, and announced that Atagi have officially recommended a second booster, or \u201cwinter jab.\u201d Hunt says the new jab will be available from 4 April, and will be targeted at adults 65 years and over, Indigenous Australians 50 years and over, aged care and disability residents and people aged 16 years and older who are severely immunocompromised.  I\u2019ve now received advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation \u2013 and they\u2019ve worked very closely with Prof Kelly \u2013 and they have recommended that there should be a winter dose, or second booster, or, in some cases, that will be known as a fourth dose, for particular groups of people.  We gave complete freedom to Atagi, and Paul and his team have worked very closely with the medical experts, and I thank them for their work. They\u2019ve probably considered this more closely than almost any other decision, in reaching those outcomes.      Updated at 11.14pm GMT     10.16pm GMT    'It will put a line in the sand': Lambie on asylum seeker deal    Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie has released a statement saying she did not regret supporting the repeal of medevac laws because it eventually led to the deal announced yesterday, to resettle asylum seekers in New Zealand.  Lambie says in the statement the negotiations and the deal itself took longer to process than she expected, and that she had to hide her frustrations lest she imperil it, but stood by her decisions:    The decision to repeal Australia\u2019s medevac laws was the hardest I\u2019ve ever had to make in my political career. In the end, I decided to support it. Not for nothing. I did it because I thought, on balance, that medevac gave me leverage to get people out of offshore detention. To let them move on with their lives, after years of limbo. That\u2019s what I told the PM. I told him to show some humanity and get those people off those damn islands.  I ended up negotiating an agreement with the government I couldn\u2019t disclose. For years, I held up my end of the agreement. Yesterday, the government held up their end. I have tried to keep calm throughout this process. I\u2019ve tried to remember that any level of frustration, anxiety, disappointment or anger I was feeling about this taking forever, those asylum seekers were feeling at levels I couldn\u2019t even comprehend. I was told if I disclosed the terms of the deal, there would be no more deal. I don\u2019t believe that was said out of malice. The United States resettlement agreement was still going when I negotiated with the Morrison government. And because not everybody who was eligible for resettlement with the United States program would definitely qualify for the New Zealand program, I couldn\u2019t speak out, in case asylum seekers who had a spot in the US deal would turn it down in the hope of taking the New Zealand option. It took longer than I wanted it to. New Zealand was going into its own election at the time and they were nervous about who they\u2019d be accepting. They needed to do their own assessments. That took time. And because of Covid and border closures, it took a lot of time. I agreed to repeal medevac in exchange for an end to offshore detention. An end which, when secured, would mean we wouldn\u2019t have a need for medevac.  I stand by it. It won\u2019t restart the boats. It won\u2019t keep costing the taxpayer. It will put a line in the sand. I\u2019m grateful we got there in the end. And I hope this means those asylum seekers can get back to living their lives. Finally there\u2019s some light at the end of the tunnel.

The Coalition has seen a seven-point fall in support among 35 to 49-year-olds, with only 29% now supporting the government. Labor saw a five-point lift to 44%.  Another previously supportive demographic, voters with household incomes of more than $150k, are looking away from the Coalition. Support dropped 12 points, from 45% to 33%.  Labor now leads in that demographic, seeing a one point rise to 36%.  Opposition leader Anthony Albanese now leads as preferred prime minister, 41% to 39%.

Dutton rejected the idea, saying Australia has a \u201cfantastic\u201d relationship with the Solomon Islands:   Not at all. If you look at ... the amount of support that we have provided into the Pacific, the work we\u2019ve done in Tonga, the work we continue to do in PNG and every other nation \u2013 I\u2019m meeting with my New Zealand counterpart this afternoon \u2013 it\u2019s a standing agenda item for all of us to be able to realistic about China\u2019s footprint, their exertion, their pressure and the way in which they conduct their business. I don\u2019t think [China\u2019s ambitions in the Pacific are] consistent with the values that we share with the Solomon Islands and with Tonga, and other countries. There\u2019s aid ... and many ways we\u2019ll work very closely together. We\u2019ll continue to do that. We want peace and stability in our region. We don\u2019t want pressure and exertion from China to continue to roll out in the region. We have a fantastic relationship with the Solomon Islands and we\u2019re there at the request of the government of the Solomon Islands at the moment. We have 50 people on the ground and they\u2019re going to stay there in the run-up to 2023. There\u2019s a lot more we can do for them. As part of the Pacific family, it is obvious we want to work together and we want to resolve any issues within that family, within our region. And we would be concerned clearly about any military base being established and we would express that to the Solomon Islands\u2019 government.      Updated at 9.05pm GMT     8.54pm GMT    Labor 'deeply concerned' by China's planned presence in Solomon Islands    The shadow minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, was on RN Breakfast this morning, and was asked by host Patricia Karvelas  about leaked documents that showed the Chinese military was planning a presence in the Solomon Islands. So, how concerned are they?   Deeply [concerned], we agree.  This would be a very significant and negative development for Australia\u2019s geopolitical interests in our region. It would frankly represent a failure of the pacific step up if these reports were true \u2013 we should be the partner of choice on all matters that would be in our view the regions best interest.      Updated at 9.06pm GMT     8.40pm GMT       Eastern states will combine to develop \u201chydrogen highways\u201d, investing an initial $20m to build a refuelling network to accelerate the decarbonisation of heavy transport. The network, to supply hydrogen created from renewable energy sources, will provide the fuel initially on the Hume, Pacific and Newell highways.  The Labor states of Queensland and Victoria will sign memorandums of understanding with Coalition-led NSW to coordinate the rollout of hydrogen on the nation\u2019s busiest major roads. Cars and light vehicles are likely to be easier to electrify than heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses, where hydrogen may be a more viable alternative than batteries. \u201cRenewable hydrogen will increasingly become a competitive zero emissions fuel option for our heavy transport sector, giving our trucking industry the opportunity to decarbonise their fleets,\u201d NSW\u2019s treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, said. His Victorian counterpart as energy and climate minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said renewable hydrogen highway would \u201ccreate new jobs, drive investment across the east coast and is a landmark step towards meeting Victoria\u2019s target to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050\u201d. Queensland\u2019s Mick de Brenni, who has hydrogen and energy among his ministerial titles, stressed the development of green hydrogen as a national security issue, \u201cto shield our nation from foreign companies and foreign powers\u201d. \u201cLow-emissions electricity and hydrogen-fuelled heavy transport will sit at the heart of the renewable energy ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cTransport is the fastest growing sector for emissions and ironically it could also be the key to reducing them.\u201d Victoria and NSW will tip in $10m each to build at least four renewable hydrogen refuelling stations between Sydney and Melbourne. There will also be grants for the country\u2019s first long-haul hydrogen fuel-cell electric freight trucks.

The Joint Select Committee have given \u201cunanimous\u201d support to the national anti-corruption commission bill, while independent MP Helen Haines and the Greens signalled they would move for amendments in the Senate. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has announced a review into the program to resettle former Afghan employees who assisted Australia in Afghanistan. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) revealed it received more than 1,300 complaints about doctors and medical professionals over Covid-related misbehaviour such as spreading conspiracy theories or flouting public health orders.

Shocking none, a wetter than expected summer is likely for much of eastern Australia. Warmer days are likely for Tasmania, central and northern Australia, and cooler days are likely for the south-eastern mainland. The outlook is driven by La Ni\u00f1a, a negative Indian Ocean dipole event, a positive phase of the southern annular mode and record warm waters around Australia. The BoM:  December to February rainfall is likely to be above median for large parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and eastern Tasmania. Northern Queensland has at least twice the average chance of unusually high rainfall. Below-median rainfall is likely for large parts of Western Australia and the western Top End. December to February maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for Tasmania, and most of western and central Australia. Below-median temperatures are likely for south-eastern parts of Queensland, central and eastern New South Wales, and parts of Victoria. December to February minimum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of Australia. Areas where this is not the case are the north-west coast and southern interior of Western Australia, and the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, extending into southern parts of Queensland.

We have answers. Taronga Zoo says failed clamps that join wire cables were behind the escape.  Preliminary independent engineering advice has confirmed that swages (clamps that join wire cables together) failed, enabling a lacing cable that connects the fence mesh to a tension cable to unravel. The lions were then able to create and squeeze through a gap. The preliminary review has recommended the engagement of an independent tensile-structure engineer to conduct detailed investigations and provide specialist advice on the failure and repair. The ongoing review also found that while inside their exhibit, the lions played and interacted with the fence for approximately 20 minutes before four cubs, and later adult male Ato, were able to breach it. Lioness Maya and one cub chose to remain in the exhibit. Lioness Maya and the cub who chose to remain in the exhibit were recalled into their dens by keepers.  The review is ongoing.

Simon Eccleshall, the head of programs for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) Australia, said the organisation \u201cwelcomes the Australian Government\u2019s announcement today that it is conducting a rapid review of the Afghan Locally Engaged Employee (LEE) program that supports humanitarian resettlement in Australia\u201d.  MSF is acutely aware of the risks faced by Afghans who worked with Australian and other foreign missions, militaries and aid organisations, and would stress the importance of including aid workers in any revised LEE definition. MSF highlights the threat posed by the Islamic State, which released a publication in August 2022 condemning the work of international medical organisations in Afghanistan, threatening the lives of local and international humanitarian workers and medical staff. MSF views this announcement as a demonstration of the Australian Government\u2019s commitment to a broader shift in refugee and asylum seeker policy, and calls on the Government to fast track the implementation of their election promise to restore permanent protection for all refugees in Australia.  Earlier today, foreign minister Penny Wong announced a review of the \u2018locally engaged employee\u2019 (LEE) program, run by the former government, of which she has been highly critical. She told a Senate estimates committee hearing this afternoon that in some cases the former government got caught up in \u201clegalism\u201d about the employment arrangements. Wong said the Taliban - which seized control of Afghanistan\u2019s capital Kabul in August last year - didn\u2019t stop to check whether a person had been directly employed by a specific department or had been engaged by a subcontractor. Announcing the review, Wong said:  I have got the agreement of Dr Vivienne Thom \u2026 who will lead an independent review into the Afghan locally engaged employee program and I hope as a consequence of that we can make changes necessary to deal with the concerns which were raised both publicly by family members and LEEs themselves but also identified by the Senate inquiry [during the previous parliament].     Updated at 6.24am GMT     5.49am GMT       Rain and storms forecast to hit central and eastern Australia The Bureau of Meteorology has warned \u201cwarm and unsettled conditions\u201d are bringing widespread rain and storms across central and eastern Australia which will increase over the weekend with possible renewed flooding. Parts of New South Wales are already experiencing flooding. Twenty-four hour rainfall totals of 91mm were observed at Dorunda in far north Queensland, while wind gusts in excess of 100 km/h were recorded in Cloncurry. The BoM:  On Thursday, a surface trough over South Australia will move into western parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, and showers and thunderstorms will extend east through the day, including Tasmania. Severe thunderstorms are also possible across western parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and eastern South Australia and may produce damaging wind gusts, flash flooding and large hail.  The BoM warned there was a \u201chigh to extreme\u201d pollen risk across Victoria in the coming days due to the thunderstorms, which will raise the risk of asthma throughout Thursday.    The BoM:  Showers and thunderstorms will continue in coming days across large parts of central and eastern Australia, along with humid conditions. A significant band of rain and thunderstorms with a cold front will develop on Saturday, and then move over the eastern states from Sunday. This system has the potential to bring moderate to heavy falls that may impact already flood-affected communities. Major flood warnings continue across several rivers in northern Victoria and inland New South Wales, while minor to moderate flooding continues through other parts of eastern Australia.

Dr Peter Mayfield, the CSIRO\u2019s executive director of environment, energy and resources, was asked by Labor senator Deb O\u2019Neill about the prospects of nuclear power in the near future. The Coalition has tried to begin a debate about nuclear energy in Australia, as the Labor government pursues clean energy policies in pursuit of a net zero by 2050 goal. Mayfield flagged that CSIRO\u2019s \u2018GenCost\u2019 report into power generation, released in July, reported \u201cthere is no prospect of a [Nuclear SMR] plant being deployed before 2030\u201d.  We don\u2019t even look at it before 2030 because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s viable in that timeframe. It would need some significant cost reductions for it to become a competitive option.  Asked about what Australia needs to achieve a reliable power network in coming years, Mayfield listed new clean energy options, better storage, a transition from fossil fuels which includes gas options, and carbon capture &amp; storage technology.  Keep building out renewables, improve storage options we have, a transition from fossil fuels that makes sense. We believe at this point in time it needs gas for quite some time and it needs CCS in the later decades to get to net zero\u2026 CCS we see as very important as well.

The Treasurer dodged my question, as much as admitting that the one million homes won\u2019t be affordable for low income renters. We know that over the last five years the private sector built one million homes, and the housing crisis got worse. In estimates, we\u2019ve heard that the great bulk of these million homes will be left up to the private sector to build how and wherever they will.

The committee tasked with scrutinising the bill, of which Haines was deputy chair, handed down its report today unanimously supporting the bill with six recommendations. Haines:  It was clear to the Committee that the overwhelming majority of groups and individuals supported the establishment of a national anti-corruption commission \u2013 and there was broad agreement in relation to a number of core elements of the bills. The best decisions are reached through collaboration and consensus. If the NACC is to withstand changes of government and the whims of the times, it needs multi-partisan support from the beginning. It is my sincere hope that this consensus continues beyond the Committee and that all members of this Parliament vote as one to pass this Bill.  Haines said while it was a \u201cgood bill\u201d she would move amendments when it comes up for debate.  I am hopeful the Government will consider them in the same good faith way the Committee has engaged with the Bill. The Committee did not hear compelling evidence from the Government in favour of retaining the exceptional circumstances test for holding public hearings, and many experts questioned why it was necessary. Together with other members of the committee I have recommended the Government consider adding measures to increase the transparency around the budget of the NACC, and measures for a special majority of the oversight committee to approve appointments of the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner.  She also recommended \u201cpork barrelling\u201d be explicitly included in the definition of corruption.  Australians now expect that Government money only goes where it is politically advantageous, not where it is most needed. My recommendations would go towards improving that trust.

Last week, the Guardian revealed the backlog of claims before the national redress scheme had more than doubled in two years. A rapid surge in claims this year - up from 300 per month to 700 on average in 2022 - had not been matched by any significant increase in resources or decision-making. The government announced $15m in new funding for the scheme this week. Social services minister Amanda Rishworth said the money would help better resource the scheme and help it deal with the increased demand from survivors. Swinburne University of Technology professor James Ogloff said the commitment would hopefully help to alleviate the suffering of survivors.  Waiting for their applications for financial support to be finalised compounds the distress many victim survivors feel. The commitment to hire additional staff for the National Redress Scheme will help clear the claims backlog and hopefully help alleviate victims\u2019 suffering.     Updated at 5.19am GMT     4.22am GMT       Albanese wraps up last question time of the parliamentary sitting The last question for the last question time this parliamentary sitting is to the prime minister Anthony Albanese, on what upcoming summits he will be attending abroad. He\u2019s a busy bee. Tomorrow after Remembrance Day commemorations in Sydney he will travel to the Asean summit in Cambodia, followed by the G20 Bali summit in Indonesia and Apec leaders summit in Thailand. In the next fortnight, meetings have been lined up with the UK prime minister \u201cand other friends\u201d. He has accepted Joko Widodo\u2019s invitation to be one of three speakers alongside prime minister Modi at the summit. As we know, the two have shared a special affinity ever since their bamboo bike ride.  The treasurer will be joining me \u2026 for the beginning of the G20 in Indonesia \u2026 and I congratulate president Joko Widodo, our friend, the work that he has done in organising this summit which is an important recognition of the standing that Indonesia has as it rises along with India to be in the top economies in the world over coming decades and on that note Mr Speaker I would asked further questions be placed on the notice paper.     Updated at 6.16am GMT     4.15am GMT       Bowen and Pike trade barbs on cost of living and energy Liberal MP and member for Bowman Henry Pike has asked Chris Bowen a question about the \u201cspiralling cost of living occurring under the government\u2019s watch\u201d. The climate minister says he is \u201cmore than happy\u201d to answer the question \u201cbecause the budget provided $20bn of funding to ensure that we rewire this country\u201d.  After years of indolence over there \u2026 we also funded 400 community batteries across Australia which will help families store the renewable energy that they generate and use it at a time and a place convenient to them because batteries store renewable energy, something the leader of the opposition has some trouble coming to terms with.  Bowen says Dutton was on 2GB this morning, where he \u201calways goes to get his toughest questions\u201d and poo-pooed renewable energy.  The leader of the opposition \u2026 still doesn\u2019t understand that just because the sun doesn\u2019t always shine in the winter, the wind doesn\u2019t always blow nor does the rain always fall but we manage to store water, we manage to drink water when it is not raining.  Laming says he \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for a history lesson\u201d but rather was asking about the cost of living.  We don\u2019t have to go back too far to be reminded of the former prime minister \u2026 who said a big battery was as useful as a big prawn. Nothing has changed over there.     Updated at 4.23am GMT     4.08am GMT       No King Charles III on our notes soon, RBA says WA Liberal senator Dean Smith has been pressing Michele Bullock, the RBA deputy governor, over whether or not the RBA will approve King Charles III to appear on $5 notes. As our colleague Amy Remeikis noted earlier this month, RBA governor Philip Lowe has been in talks with Labor about the matter. All Australian notes carried a monarch between 1923 and 1953, so estimates heard today. Anyway, it seems the decision will be between a depiction of the new King \u201cor some sort of Australian-style design\u201d, Bullock said. We shouldn\u2019t expect an early revision of our fivers, though, with the decision likely to take 12 months at least, and require the Buck House signing off on the note should they be graced by KCIII. Perhaps pessimistically, Smith intones, \u201cit\u2019s quite a heavy burden for the RBA board to get wrong\u201d. Well, right or wrong will depend on which side of the ledger you fall, Bullock says.       4.04am GMT       Dutton thanks veterans on eve of Remembrance Day The leader of the opposition Peter Dutton is up. On the eve of Remembrance Day, he thanks all the veterans in the chamber for their service.  To all of those veterans who will be commemorating Remembrance Day \u2026 to all of those family members \u2026 it is important we recognise their service to keep our country safe not just in generations past, but in future generations as well.     Updated at 4.14am GMT     3.59am GMT       Albanese says Australia has \u2018fallen behind\u2019 on climate but can be part of global shift Independent MP for Warringah Zali Steggall has asked a question about Cop27.  The planet has already warmed by 1.2C but current pledges including your government\u2019s inadequate 43% by 2030 have us on track for 3C of warming. Will your government stop making the problem worse by funding and approving further fossil fuel projects?  Anthony Albanese is up. The PM thanks Steggall for her \u201cgenuine engagement on the issue of climate change\u201d.  As the member pointed out in the preamble to her question, she spoke about what was happening at Cop27 and spoke about the global effort, because indeed climate change does require a global effort.  He says the previous chair of Cop27 \u201cwelcomed Australia back\u201d as part of the global effort to tackle climate change, and reiterates the commitment of 43% by 2030 as a pathway to 2050 net zero \u2013 which Steggall called inadequate.  Australia has fallen behind where we should be because we have had a decade of deny and delay, and we didn\u2019t have any climate policy. This government understands that we need to deal with energy policy, transport policy, housing policy, we need to make homes more efficient, we need to change the make up of our transport network with accordance of what\u2019s happening around the world and we need to move to the cheapest and cleanest form of the new energy which is renewables. We need to do that in partnership with the rest of the world, and I look forward to in the coming days meeting with global leaders, talking about how we co-operate. I am optimistic that the world can move. I want Australia to be a part of that and my government\u2019s commitment is to do just that.

As someone who has driven on a road recently, I can testify the situation is dire. He refers infrastructure minister Catherine King to the $9.3bn in cancelled infrastructure funding in the budget including $208m already committed by the Coalition to stage one of the Goulburn Valley highway bypass of Shepparton in his electorate. Is the government \u201cabandoning regional Victoria\u201d? King says Birrell \u201cmeans well\u201d but the government has inherited an \u201cabsolute mess\u201d when it comes to the infrastructure investment pipeline.  This government is investing $123bn over the next 10 years, increasing funding to regional communities by over $4bn over the next 10 years, I am very proud of that investment.  She says the money for the bypass remains in the budget and Labor is \u201cfully committed\u201d to the project, then has a dig at the Coalition for being all about \u201cannouncement and not able to deliver\u201d.  You are more interested in getting an announcement on the papers, putting a press release out. You can\u2019t drive on a press release. You can\u2019t actually build a road if you don\u2019t have enough money for it and that is the problem.

She says \u201cevery day\u201d she is hearing similar stories with constituents being left sick and untreated. Minister for health and aged care Mark Butler says he shares her concerns, that general practice is in the \u201cworst shape it has been in the almost 40 year history of Medicare\u201d and \u201call of the trends in general are bad\u201d.  We know that bulk billing rates have been dropping \u2026 I suspect every member of this house are talking to GPs and patients who say that billing rates are plummeting. GPs will tell them how distressed they are at having to change their bulk billing policies. We know that about one in three Australians pay a gap fee in this country and those gap fees have skyrocketed.  He says this is the fault of the opposition.  It is the leader of the opposition who tried to ram through attacks that make every Australian pay a fee for every consultant in general practice and when he couldn\u2019t do that, pursue the Medicare rebate for six long years. I am not going to pretend that it is going to be a quick or an easy job to fix up nine long years of cuts and neglect but \u2026 we have already invested $160 million in a rural general package, we\u2019ve invested more than $220 million to strengthen general practice grants which will be rolling out in the coming weeks and months and only last week again I met with the strengthening Medicare taskforce to advise the government on our investment of $250 million each and every year.

Shadow minister for business Paul Fletcher asks Chris Bowen:  At a time when Australia urgently needs more gas supply, why has the government funded $9.8 million over four years to activists who oppose and stop new gas projects?   Bowen:  We have not.        3.39am GMT    Complaints about Covid behaviour of medical professionals tally 1,300, Ahpra says    Ahpra receives more than 1,300 The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) has revealed it received more than 1,300 complaints about doctors and medical professionals over Covid-related misbehaviour such as spreading conspiracy theories or flouting public health orders. In a Senate estimates hearing, Ahpra said it had taken action against 28 doctors including for actions such as not wearing masks, claiming the pandemic was fake or that vaccines were \u201cgovernment mind control\u201d. But the health regulator hit back at criticisms from Liberal senators Alex Antic and Gerard Rennick, refuting allegations it was \u201csilencing\u201d doctors and defending its actions in taking action against practitioners working against government advice and scientific evidence. Ahpra was among government agencies appearing before the health committee in Parliament House on Thursday. CEO Martin Fletcher said it had received 1,303 notifications against 1,006 practitioners (including doctors, nurses, psychologists and other professionals) for Covid-related actions. He said after investigations, 28 had been subjected to \u201cimmediate action\u201d:  11 were suspended from practise over spreading misinformation, with examples given such as claiming Covid was fake or that the vaccines were \u201cgovernment mind control\u201d; 10 were suspended over actions including failing to comply with health orders, faking the administration of vaccines, or concerns over large-scale vaccine exemptions given to patients; while seven were not suspended but had restrictions placed upon them, such as additional supervision while on the job.     Concerns were also raised about doctors giving vaccine exemptions that did not follow government guidelines, behaviour like refusing to wear masks, practising while unwell, or online conduct including \u201cspreading conspiracy theories\u201d, Fletcher said. In response to questions from Rennick about workers losing their jobs over refusing to get Covid vaccinations, and claims that some doctors were fearful of giving vaccine exemptions to people who reported having side-effects from the vaccine, Fletcher said Ahpra did not want doctors to be fearful of the regulatory body:  But I don\u2019t step back from the fact that our fundamental focus is on public safety and patient safety, and if concerns are raised with us about risk to safety, we\u2019re obliged to look at them and if there\u2019s a need for us to take regulatory action, we\u2019ll take it.  Antic asked Fletcher how Ahpra decided what was \u201caccurate\u201d information, to which Fletcher responded it relied on expert government advice. Antic asked whether Fletcher believed it was a \u201cgreat big bureaucratic stitch-up\u201d and a \u201ccartel of regulatory totalitarianism\u201d. Prof Brendan Murphy, the health department secretary and the nation\u2019s chief medical officer during the first part of the pandemic, shot back \u201cit\u2019s a regulatory environment that works on the best available evidence\u201d.    Updated at 3.59am GMT     3.34am GMT       Bowen bristles at Liberal MP\u2019s question on gas prices  Liberal MP and member for Fairfax Ted O\u2019Brien is up and about on the energy crisis, running the old wives tale that Labor doesn\u2019t know how to handle the economy. He asks energy minister Chris Bowen about a projection in the budget that gas prices will rise by 44% in two years.  Since the budget, government ministers have spoken about price caps, no price caps, direct assistance, no direct assistance, extra supply, limited supply, taxes on companies, no extra company taxes on companies. Does the minister have any idea what he is doing, or is this just yet again Labor proving it doesn\u2019t know how to manage money, doesn\u2019t know how to manage the economy?  Bowen says he is \u201ctrying to take a statesmanlike tone \u2026 but it\u2019s hard, when you get questions like that\u201d.  Questions from an opposition about gas prices and how much they are going up, when on the day the member for Hume became the minister of energy, gas was $9.40, and at the time of the election it was $34.75! That\u2019s pretty good! Some would say that\u2019s fantastic! Maybe the gas companies would say that\u2019s fantastic but Australian consumers would not.     Updated at 3.45am GMT     3.29am GMT       Tony Burke just got on such a roll his time expired. The question was on a motion earlier today moved by Peter Dutton on changes to enterprise bargaining. Burke says:  Everybody wants to get wages moving. We kept hearing from people on each side of the debate that they want to give people pay rises. Yet there are two tests, one, are you willing to do anything about it, and secondly, we ended up with a vote that was designed to do the exact opposite. Today, in a motion moved by none other than a leader of the opposition, it said that they were calling on us to have changes to enterprise bargaining \u2026 so in the same time that this parliament was debating on the need to get wages moving with people facing higher inflation, those opposite took to a vote, took to a vote to bring back the 2020 legislation. What does it mean if you suspended the better off overall test? It means a part-time level to hospitality worker aged over 21 could see the hourly New Year\u2019s Eve rates slashed from $46. Instead of earning $375, they would earn $166.

Using the standard definition of affordable housing as used by the Victorian government where a person on a low income pays no more than 30% of the income on rent or other housing costs, what proportion of the government\u2019s promised one million homes will be affordable?  The federal government promised to build one million homes in the latest budget as part of the housing accord, including \u201caffordable\u201d properties. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the government recognises extremely low vacancy rates and extremely high rents are hitting Australians (as a Sydney renter, this is a big mood).  What we have done is brought together state and territory governments and local governments, the building industry, the \u2026 and other institutional investors to sign up to a target of affordable homes to be built from 2024- 2029, in the hope that by bringing people together, and by providing an element of government investment, we can subsidise the rental returns for builders, the community housing providers and super funds to take something which is not appealing enough to investors to make it a bit more appealing, but most importantly we have to build more housing stock. We do have a problem in this country when it comes to the supply of affordable rental properties. We are trying to do something about it, we do see a role for the commonwealth \u2026 in dealing with the problem that has been with us for too long, that is what the housing accord is all about, building more affordable properties, and that\u2019s what we intend to do.

If you missed it, the joint select committee on the national anti-corruption commission bill tabled its unanimous report in parliament today. He takes a little trip down memory lane:  On the 28 September 2022 I introduced a bill to establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anti-corruption commission. On the same day a joint select committee was established to enquire into the bill. The committee called for submissions addressing the provisions of the bill and held four days of public hearings. Today Helen Haines and the deputy chair of the committee tabled its report in the house \u2026 I am delighted that the committee made up of government, opposition and cross-bench members of both houses has delivered a unanimous report today. This is the parliament at its finest, with members and senators coming together to find common ground and to find a constructive way forward. In doing so they have respected the mandate given by the Australian people on the 21 May to the Albanese government to establish a powerful, transparent and independent national anti-corruption commission.  Dreyfus says this is the \u201csingle biggest integrity reform\u201d parliament has seen \u201cfor decades\u201d.  The government will now carefully consider this report and its recommendations ahead of the resumption of debate on the bill in the next session of parliament. We are determined to pass this legislation and have the commission up and running by mid 2023.

O\u2019Neil says she is frankly shocked.  It is so regrettable that at a moment like this, the opposition wants to politicise the pain and suffering of Australians. I am genuinely shocked. I have been a member of parliament for nine years and usually in moments like this, we have a rare time to come together as a parliament to help people. And I just cannot believe that people who are suffering, who have had personal information about them revealed, that you are trying to politicise this. I am just genuinely shocked. This is an incredibly embarrassing question from someone who was the minister for cybersecurity five months ago.     Updated at 3.32am GMT     3.09am GMT       O\u2019Neil says Australia\u2019s \u2018smartest and toughest\u2019 are coming for Medibank hackers Labor MP and member for Blair Shayne Neumann has asked Clare O\u2019Neil how she is responding to the latest revelations in the Medibank attack, which included specific references to abortion. She says it was indicated yesterday the consequences of the Medibank hack were likely to get worse, and today, \u201cthose fears have been realised\u201d. She says what has occurred is \u201cmorally reprehensible and it is criminal\u201d.  I want to say, particularly to the women whose private health information has been compromised overnight, as the minister for cybersecurity but more importantly, as a woman, this should not have happened, and I\u2019d know this is a really difficult time. I want you to know that as a parliament and as a government, we stand with you. You are entitled to keep your health information [being kept] private and what has occurred here is morally reprehensible and it is criminal. The concerns and issues that citizens will face \u2026 have many variations. Some will need technical questions answered, some will be victims of crime, some will need \u2026 and much more vulnerable citizens who are affected here are going to require intensive case management \u2026 our focus as a parliament is on Medicare stepping up on this, but of course there are requirements here are as a government. We are very focused on how to make this easy and simple for citizens.  O\u2019Neil spoke with the Medibank CEO twice today and made it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d the expectations of the Australian community.  They owe that people who need help are able to get it. Medibank is providing a clean one-stop shop \u2026 and it is important that that support is scalable and I received the assurance from Medibank today that if a large data dump occurs, they are fully ready to provide services when and if they are needed to Australians who need them. We are supporting that work \u2026 I want the scumbags behind this attack to know that the smartest and toughest people in this country are coming after you.     Updated at 3.34am GMT     3.04am GMT    Wong announces review of program to resettle Afghans who assisted Australia    The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has announced a review into the program to resettle former Afghan employees who assisted Australia in Afghanistan. Wong was highly critical of the handling of the locally engaged employee (LEE) program by the former government. She told a Senate estimates committee hearing this afternoon that in some cases the former government got caught up in \u201clegalism\u201d about the employment arrangements. Wong said the Taliban, which seized control of Afghanistan\u2019s capital Kabul in August last year, didn\u2019t stop to check whether a person had been directly employed by a specific department or had been engaged by a subcontractor. Announcing the review, Wong said:  I have got the agreement of Dr Vivienne Thom \u2026 who will lead an independent review into the Afghan locally engaged employee program and I hope as a consequence of that we can make changes necessary to deal with the concerns which were raised both publicly by family members and LEEs themselves but also identified by the Senate inquiry [during the previous parliament].  A government statement issued a short time ago said Thom\u2019s review would examine how program decisions were made, including the application and appeals process, record keeping and departmental resourcing. It would also consider whether the legislative instrument that underpins this program remained fit for purpose. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said in the statement:  Our current and former ADF personnel have been clear about the painful impact of leaving people behind in Afghanistan. Dr Thom\u2019s review is critical to ensuring our ADF personnel can have confidence that Australia will stand by those help us.  The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, said Australia had a duty to ensure that its humanitarian efforts focused on those whose safety was most at risk, especially those who may face harm due to their involvement in Australia\u2019s mission in Afghanistan. The Thom review is due to report back to government early next year. Meanwhile, a Dfat official said the department was currently assessing 261 applications for certification. The review was one of the recommendations of a damning Senate committee report - you can see that previous coverage here:   Related: \u2018Dishonourable\u2019: report says Afghans left behind \u2018at high risk of brutal reprisals\u2019 due to links with Australia      Updated at 3.23am GMT     3.02am GMT    Question time begins    Alright you know what time it is \u2026 question time, of course!    Updated at 3.23am GMT     3.01am GMT       Dreyfus says Labor committed to protecting journalists and sources On the national integrity bill, Dreyfus was asked if he agreed that journalists and whistleblowers needed more protection. He said it was a \u201clongstanding commitment\u201d of the Labor party to uphold press freedom:  This bill contains protection for journalists. It contains protection of journalist sources. It is a longstanding commitment of the Australian Labor party. A clear commitment of this government that there should be protections for journalists. No journalist should be punished for doing their work.  Independent MP Helen Haines said she was surprised at the exclusion of the exceptional circumstances test in the bill. Was this done to secure support of the Coalition? Dreyfus:  We will give complete consideration to all recommendations of the committee and indeed, all of the well considered suggestions made during the course of the parliamentary hearings and submissions made. I can say very directly there have been no deals done anywhere in the parliament or the passage of this legislation. The bill that I brought to the parliament on 29 September is a bill that our government thinks is the best possible model for establishing, at long last, a national anti-corruption commission in Australia.     Updated at 3.19am GMT     2.58am GMT    Committee gives \u2018unanimous\u2019 support to national anti-corruption commission bill    The joint select committee on the national anti-corruption commission bill has tabled its unanimous report in parliament today. Attorney general Mark Dreyfus said the unanimous support of a committee made up of both houses, the opposition and crossbench \u201cgives confidence\u201d to the Australian people.  I am delighted that the report is a unanimous report because it is the best possible basis for going forward in this parliament with this really important piece of legislation. It has been a long time coming.  He said the bill would be brought back for debate on 21 or 22 of November.  Our intention is the legislation will pass through the parliament this year so that we can then get on with the very important job of setting up the commission with a view to it commencing operations around the middle of next year.

She said businesses had \u201cabandoned\u201d the Labor party\u2019s legislation.  We have seen lining up, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and industry, the Council of Small Businesses, the Minerals Council, the National Farmers Federation, all saying that this bill is not in a fit state to pass.

Zali Steggall, the member for Warringah, highlighted there were nuances that undermine the government\u2019s claim that the bill was a step forward for gender pay equality:  It is disingenuous of other government to claim that this is to assess feminised industries when many small businesses are run by women, and they will be the first to suffer when this legislation brings an absolute stall to sectors like childcare.

Sophie Scamps, the independent member for Mackellar, said:  The problem I have with the omnibus nature of the fair work legislation Amendment is that many of these excellent policies are bundled up with the more controversial ones, and this has created a Sophie\u2019s choice when it comes to voting. As with many of my crossbench colleagues, I too have serious concerns for the consequences of this legislation will have on small business.       Updated at 2.50am GMT     2.32am GMT       HECS debt wiped for rural health workers The government is offering to wipe the study debt of doctors and nurses who choose to live in rural and remote areas, in an attempt to address the shortage of medical staff in the bush. Under new legislation to be introduced by the government today, eligibility will depend on the remoteness of the placement and the length of time worked. A doctor or nurse practitioner who works in a remote or very remote town for a time period of half the length of their course would have their entire HELP debt wiped. Those who live in a large, medium or small rural town for a time period equal to the whole length of their course would have their entire HELP debt wiped. The government also said that those living in \u201can eligible place for a period of time equivalent to half the time required is eligible to half the applicable debt reduction.\u201d Approximately 850 doctors and nurse practitioners are expected to be attracted to rural and remote areas every year, the government predicts. The measures would be effective from the first day of the new year. The minister for education, Jason Clare, said:  Zero HECS debt is a great incentive for young graduates to live and work and build their careers in rural and remote communities.  The health minister, Mark Butler, indicated he thought the measure would also help make working outside the cities a more likely long term option too.  We recognise the challenge of recruiting and retaining primary health care workers in rural and remote communities. These measures will make country practice a more attractive long-term career option for doctors and nurse practitioners.  Guardian Australia\u2019s rural network recently highlighted that long term solutions for the healthcare crisis in the bush could also be found in local populations, particularly by tapping into demographics like men that haven\u2019t been part of nursing recruitment drives:   Related: As a troubled bush teen, I found meaning in an unlikely place: I became a nurse |  James McKenzie Watson         2.22am GMT       RBA \u2018not bankrupt\u2019, Bullock reassures senators The Reserve Bank\u2019s deputy governor Michele Bullock has been asked about the huge losses and negative equity of $12.4bn as of the end of June, by the National party senator Matt Canavan. We covered the big losses reported by the RBA and negative equity issue here:   Related: Reserve Bank of Australia reports loss of $37bn and plans to cut dividends to Treasury    Anyway, Canavan asks: \u201cIs the RBA bankrupt?\u201d \u201cNo, the RBA is not bankrupt,\u201d Bullock replies. As the central bank, it can print money, and so is not like a commercial bank. (Cue, phews.) The reason why the RBA has such large unrealised losses \u2013 about $37bn last financial year \u2013 is that the central bank snapped up many billions of dollars of Australian government debt during the Covid pandemic to force interest rates down. As interest rates have risen, the value of the holdings has dived if \u201cmarked to market\u201d. Anyway, the bank plans to let most if not all the debt mature, hence the \u201cunrealised\u201d bit about those losses. Canavan\u2019s fellow Queensland LNP colleague Gerard Rennick, meanwhile, was eager earlier to press the RBA to reveal its exchanges with the Bank of International Settlement (the \u201ccentral bank of central banks\u201d). That information, not surprisingly, is confidential, and the RBA is not about to cough it up. Rennick says the BIS had a \u201cnotorious history\u201d. \u201cThey melted down the gold, Nazi gold,\u201d Rennick said, tugging on a rather long bow when it comes to current discussions.

She says:  Hi, my name is Laura, in Canberra, I am a mum of three, and I have been an early educator for 18 years. What this Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill will mean for us is hope and I really want to thank the minister and the Albanese government for giving us this hope. It is going to give us the opportunity to see wages moving, wages that have remained on hold for the better part of a decade under the previous government. So we now have that hope that we can no longer have to work two jobs to keep our lives running. I talk with educators every day that are really struggling with the cost of living, with our wages, and what this does is it gives all of us that real genuine hope that we can keep the passion for what we do, the passion for early childhood education and care and that we can start to see a real difference in our lives and in the lives of the children we look after. So I really want to thank you again for the hope you has given us today.     Updated at 2.31am GMT     2.15am GMT       Peter Dutton\u2019s IR bill amendment about \u2018pay cuts\u2019, Tony Burke says Tony Burke goes on to speak about the opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s amendment:  There is amendment that was moved this morning that a lot of people won\u2019t know about. It was moved by Peter Dutton. And he called on the parliament to go back to the changes to industrial relations that were brought into this place in 2020, when Christian Porter was the minister. They were changes that allowed the full suspension of the better off overall test for two years through agreements that would remain intact for a further four years. They were about pay cuts that could last six years and more. So we had two votes, effectively, in terms of the major parties. We had a vote brought on by Peter Dutton and the Liberal party that called for sustained wage cut and we had a vote, supported in the House by the government and a number of crossbench members of parliament, that said let\u2019s get wages moving. And in doing that, let\u2019s prioritise those areas that have been left behind in bargaining.     Updated at 2.39am GMT     2.13am GMT       Tony Bourke says \u2018feminised\u2019 workplaces \u2018left behind\u2019 on bargaining and wages The minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, just spoke in Canberra after the workplace relations bill passed the lower house:  Too many workplaces that have been left behind in bargaining. In particular, feminised industries. And I\u2019m really proud that at the exact moment that the House of Representatives makes this decision, I\u2019m standing here with these workers. Early childhood educators, workers who provided the example of how a sector where the enterprise by enterprise bargaining had been really hard and they hadn\u2019t benefited from that system, but were able to work together across a number of workplaces and provide that great Victorian example of wage rates that are now well above the award. When wages aren\u2019t moving, people are feeling that in every household at the moment. And we hear lots of people in this building talk about cost of living. The cost of living has two sides. It has prices and it has wages and you can\u2019t seriously care about cost of living unless you are doing something about wages.

The secure jobs, better pay bill \u2013 the most extensive changes to workplace laws in two decades \u2013 will now pass to the Senate, where ACT independent David Pocock is the swing vote who has driven a suite of changes to accommodate business concerns. The bill passed 80 votes to 56 shortly after 1pm, with independent MPs Zoe Daniel, Monique Ryan, Bob Katter and Andrew Wilkie joining Labor and the Greens in favour. The Coalition, along with MPs Kate Chaney, Allegra Spender, Sophie Scamps, Helen Haines, Rebekha Sharkie and Dai Le voted against at both the second and third reading stage.

Pratt did not recall Wilson being there but said it was possible she was. He also did not recall any mention of discussion about the welfare compliance measure that became robodebt, and there was no reference to it in his notes. His handwritten notes, shown to the commission, did mention the phrase \u201cwelfare cop\u201d. Morrison had flagged in media at the time his desire for a \u201cstrong welfare cop on the beat\u201d. Pratt said he had no knowledge of the use of income averaging \u2013 the unlawful debt raising method used in the scheme. Asked if Wilson had raised the issue of the legality of the scheme with him, Pratt said he no recollection of that, though he did not rule it out.    Updated at 2.07am GMT     2.00am GMT       Robodebt royal commission probes which department was ultimately responsible for scheme The former social services minister, Christian Porter, called the head of his department at the initial height of the robodebt scheme and asked words to the effect of \u201cwhat the hell is this all about?\u201d, a royal commission has been told. Finn Pratt, then the secretary of the Department of Social Services in late 2016, told the inquiry:   Mr Porter might have said something in the order of, \u2018What the hell is all this about?\u2019 I think my response was \u2018You are reading the same media I am. This is clearly something which DHS is doing.\u2019  Guardian Australia reported on the controversy in a series of stories in December 2016. Pratt said he had connected Porter with the acting secretary of the Department of Human Services, because that department was running the debt recovery scheme. Kathryn Campbell, who is being called to the inquiry, was on leave at the time. The question of which department was ultimately responsible for the program is one of the key questions being asked by the royal commission. At the time, the Department of Social Services held internal advice saying the scheme was likely unlawful. However, Serena Wilson, a deputy secretary and one of a handful people who was second in charge to Pratt, said she did not share the advice with Porter, and likely didn\u2019t share it with Pratt either.

(Let the record note that the comments were always qualified, \u201cbased on conditions and so forth\u201d, but the message many people would have taken was the bank\u2019s cash rate wasn\u2019t about to budge soon.) The issue, deputy governor Michele Bullock says, was that economic conditions during Covid were \u201cdire\u201d and that the settings reflected that. As economies roared out of the lockdowns, supply shortages contributed to the emerging inflation. (Add Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the global energy and food price spikes, and inflation suddenly loomed large.) Bullock said:  We were caught by surprise as was everyone.  Nobody at the bank, though, lost their jobs over the miscalculations, she conceded.      Updated at 2.27am GMT     1.30am GMT    Gender and sexuality questions could be included in the next census    Gender and sexuality questions could be included in the next census, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics telling the Senate economics committee it is on a \u201cjourney\u201d and the census adapts in line with changes in society. The inclusion of the question became embroiled in controversy ahead of the 2021 census after it emerged that the then assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, had expressed \u201ca preference\u201d for the questions not to be included. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg asked the head of the ABS, David Gruen, about its advice to the previous Coalition government. Gruen said the advice had included both \u201cpros and cons\u201d for asking questions about gender and sexual orientation, but had not expressed a preference, with the decision left up to the government. When pressed on what the pros and cons were for inclusion of the questions on sexuality and gender, Gruen said that the advantages were access to information of \u201cconsiderable interest\u201d for groups in the community, while the disadvantage was the inclusion of a \u201csensitive\u201d question that went to a household, rather than an individual.  The aspect of it that makes this more complicated than many things is that you send the census to a household and you ask someone to fill the census in, and these are highly sensitive personal pieces of information that perhaps some members of the household have not shared with other members of the household.  He said that the ABS collected similar information in individual surveys, but the census was a \u201cdifferent kettle of fish\u201d. The general manager of the census for the ABS, Duncan Young, said that when they had done some testing ahead of the 2021 census there had been \u201csome confusion\u201d with people not understanding the difference between questions about sex and gender.  They thought they were being asked the same question twice; there is not a universal understanding across the community. However we are on a bit of journey here, and these things do change from census to census, and the censuses continue to adapt to the society that it is run in and we will start our public consultation process early in 2023 ... and we expect this will be an area of interest in that process.  Gruen said new advice would be provided to the government \u201cwell in advance\u201d of the 2026 census after consultation with the community.    Updated at 2.23am GMT     1.24am GMT    First Nations ambassador plans spark heated exchange at estimates    The Northern Territory Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has criticised the government\u2019s plans to appoint an ambassador for First Nations people, sparking some heated exchanges at Senate estimates. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the position would enable connections to be made that contributed to Australia\u2019s international influence:  This is about telling the full breadth of the story about who we are.  Price contended that the role was about the \u201ccontinuing theme of segregation of First Nations people\u201d. Wong replied:  I reject that. It\u2019s not about segregation. It\u2019s about inclusion.  Wong said it was elevating First Nations voices to \u201ca place in our international story that we have not told\u201d to date. Price suggested that it would be better to recognise everyone as Australians, saying the move was \u201cideologically driven\u201d:  As someone who has Indigenous heritage, I do find it divisive.  Price, a long-standing critic of the plans for an Indigenous Voice to parliament and who doesn\u2019t believe the Uluru Statement from the Heart represents the view of all Indigenous Australians, told Wong:  Well, I doubt that you would accept 0.03% of the Asian community on anything with regard to any decisions made with regard to the Asian community of Australia, which is on the same sort of principle.  Wong replied:  Well I\u2019ll answer that. You want to talk about my ethnicity and my heritage. I am deeply proud and deeply grateful that the Australian people have chosen to put more people from diverse backgrounds into our parliament.  Price:  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re proud.  Wong:  I am. I think it is a good thing for our country. You asked me a question about being Chinese so I\u2019m responding.  Price:  I didn\u2019t ask you a question on that. I put it to you that that\u2019s what the premise is ... You would probably feel insulted if that was the case for Asian Australians and that\u2019s the point I wanted to make.  Price went on to suggest the ambassador for First Nations people was a \u201canother international PR role for the Voice referendum internationally\u201d. Wong said the government would continue \u201carticulating and projecting the reality of modern Australia\u201d, including multicultural and First Nations heritage.    Updated at 1.49am GMT     1.21am GMT       Reserve Bank deputy governor Michele Bullock and assistant governor Christopher Kent are appearing at Senate estimates this afternoon, with inflation and interest rates high on senators\u2019 agendas. Interestingly, to underscore the central bank\u2019s independence, related ministers are absent from today\u2019s hearing. (Not sure if that applies to any other agency.) NSW Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has opened the session, with a query about whether the RBA\u2019s leadership team has met with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, a question taken on notice. Getting into the questions about what\u2019s causing inflation, we learn the RBA takes the projections about energy prices next year from the federal budget (rather than doing their own number crunching). The budget predicted electricity prices would rise 20% this fiscal year, most of it already turning up on bills, and another 30% next year. Gas would go up 20% in both. (Those numbers are a bit rubbery, since it\u2019s a national number and states vary a lot, especially Western Australia with its gas reservation keeping a lid on power prices that the east can only look on with envy.) Anyway, we\u2019ll have about two hours of hearings to cover. Not quite \u201cstrap in\u201d but more \u201cstay tuned\u201d.

Updated at 1.20am GMT     1.15am GMT       Government kicks off $15m plan to increase energy efficiency of homes and businesses The federal government has begun consultation for a national energy performance strategy to improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses. The government has set aside $15.2m over four years for development of a framework for demand-side improvements. The review will examine ways to both lower energy demand and improve energy performance and will consider whether energy efficiency targets should be set across the economy. Such targets already exist in countries including Japan and the European Union. The assistant minister for climate change and energy, Jenny McAllister, said more energy efficient homes and businesses would take pressure off energy bills, the energy system and the climate. She said Australia was lagging behind other countries in making these kinds of improvements.  We want to support affordable energy for Australians, ensuring no one gets left behind, while taking strong action on climate change. Action on the demand-side of the market will mean Australians can take control of their energy use. This is an issue directly affecting the health and welfare of our nation, including low-income and disadvantaged households, and regional communities.  The government has released a discussion paper which says energy efficiency improvements \u2013 such as more efficient buildings and appliances \u2013 could significantly reduce Australia\u2019s emissions, with residential buildings and the commercial and services sectors responsible for about 11% of Australia\u2019s emissions. The consultation paper is seeking submissions on issues including energy efficiency targets, governance and the residential, commercial and industrial sectors until 3 February.    Updated at 1.21am GMT     1.04am GMT    Iranian diplomat called in three times amid protester crackdown    Iran\u2019s senior diplomat in Canberra has been \u201ccalled in\u201d by Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade three times over human rights abuses in Iran. Australian officials have also told a Senate estimates hearing that they have raised \u201cvery concerning reports about intimidation of people here in the community\u201d. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the government had condemned the crackdown on protesters and the repression of women and called for a prompt and impartial investigation into death of Mahsa Amini. Marc Innes-Brown, a first assistant secretary for the Middle East Africa and Afghanistan Division, told the Senate committee:  I have called in the Iranian charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires on three occasions during this period to convey in the strongest possible terms our concerns about what has happened. I\u2019ve also spoken to him on another occasion about very concerning reports about intimidation of people here in the community.  Wong did not speculate on potential further sanctions ahead of such decisions being made, but said she understood the call for further steps. The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, said the issue of whether Magnitsky-style sanctions could be applied was \u201cunder active consideration\u201d. The Liberal senator Claire Chandler said the Iranian community in Australia was looking for tangible action.    Updated at 1.11am GMT     12.45am GMT       \u2018You\u2019re asking me to foresee the future\u2019: Wong on recognition of Palestine The Australian government does not recognise the state of Palestine but acknowledges \u201ctheir future aspirations for statehood\u201d, a Senate estimates committee hearing has been told. In both 2018 and 2021, Labor\u2019s national conference backed a resolution that \u201csupports the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure and recognised borders\u201d and \u201ccalls on the next Labor government to recognise Palestine as a state\u201d. However, those resolutions did not set a specific deadline, saying only that the party expected \u201cthat this issue will be an important priority for the next Labor government\u201d. The Coalition\u2019s Simon Birmingham asked the government to outline its position on the recognition of Palestine. Marc Innes-Brown, a first assistant secretary for the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, replied:  The Australian government does not recognise the state of Palestine. We obviously acknowledge their future aspirations for statehood but we at this time do not recognise a state of Palestine.  Wong said the government urged all sides to \u201cresume negotiations towards a just and enduring two-state solution\u201d. She said that principle was \u201cpart what drives the reversal\u201d on the recognition of West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Birmingham asked whether the government\u2019s policy on Palestinian statehood would remain the same in the life of parliament absent a resolution on two-state solution. Wong said:  You\u2019re asking me to foresee the future.  In a clear attempt not to be locked into a position, Wong distinguished the Labor party platform from the government\u2019s position:  The government\u2019s position is, as Mr Innes-Brown outlined, and I\u2019m sure you would be aware of this: obviously there are many parts of the community who feel deeply about this issue on both sides of the debate. Just as there are communities who feel deeply supportive, as the Labor party has been, of the establishment of the state of Israel and the right of Israel to live in security behind intentionally recognised borders, there are also people who have a very strong view about the lack of progress towards a two-state solution and the consequences of that for the Palestinian people. This has been a discussion in the community for many years. The resolution that the Labor party has arrived at is an expression from the national conference about the will of the national conference but a recognition that this is a matter for government.

Under questioning from Labor senator Deb O\u2019Neil, ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Australians were losing more than $2bn a year, describing it as \u201cboth a financial loss and a source of emotional trauma\u201d for people who were affected.  We also have found that consumers, the victims, are disproportionately older than younger, so all groups you expect to be more vulnerable and experience vulnerability \u2013 the Indigenous community, the CALD [culturally and linguistically diverse] community, refugees, for instance, will receive threats of being deported if they don\u2019t take action transfer money etc, so scammers are incredibly capable of targeting people with vulnerability, and the data we receive in our reports indicates that there is a disproportionate impact in each of these more vulnerable members of the community.  She said that the number of reports received by the ACCC was more than 177,000 in just four months, with these figures suggesting a dramatic increase in the incidence of scamming. She said that the $2bn in losses last financial year was a likely underestimate. Cass-Gottlieb said the ACCC was pleased to receive a $12m government grant which it would use towards the establishment of a national anti-scam centre, whose primary task would be to \u201cmake Australia a harder target for scammers\u201d. She said:  They will target countries that they think are the most vulnerable.

The state government has called for further funding for overwhelmed hospital clinics treating Victorians for long Covid but has not put a dollar figure on the requested investment. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Andrews said if the government was re-elected this month it would push for a continued partnership with the federal government for Covid support:  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be on our own there. Whether it\u2019s NSW, every state has been having really important discussions with the commonwealth government about this next phase of Covid.

One detail from earlier when the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, made fresh concessions. Labor has agreed to exclude the entire commercial building and construction industry from multi-employer bargaining, replacing the clause targeting the construction union for breaches of industrial law with a general exclusion. Burke told the House this decision \u2013 likely to exclude electricians, plumbers and other trades bargaining together \u2013 was \u201cnot taken lightly\u201d. The government does \u201cnot believe it is appropriate or necessary to extend multi-employer bargaining to this industry at this time\u201d, he said.

She said:  We are considering the questions about whether there are other mechanisms for small manufacturers to participate potentially in a collective bargaining capacity in terms of an acquisition from producers so we are trying to test the question of bargaining power and improving bargaining power in multiple ways.  She also said that while the initial focus of the ACCC\u2019s work was on the \u201ctop of the supply chain\u201d, the ACCC was also looking at the retail picture.  We do watch this situation ... that at the retail level the market operates in a properly competitive fashion. If the parties are not operating in a properly competitive fashion ... we will watch it very closely and take action. The immediate focus is looking at the top of the supply chain, but we are seeking to ensure that all parties, including all parties who are users and purchasers, would also be subject to obligations.  McDonald then asks about the need to increase supplies, pointing to projects in Queensland and the NSW Narrabri projects as ways to increase supply into the market. She suggests that price controls may make these projects less likely to go ahead, and asks Cass-Gottlieb her view. The ACCC chair says this view had been put forward by some producers, and it would \u201ctake them into account\u201d.

At a Senate estimates hearing, the opposition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, Simon Birmingham, asked whether it was always her intention to make the announcement in mid-October:  No. I don\u2019t generally do things that way. I think you know that, Senator. I like to be a little more prepared.  Wong has declined to say who authorised the change in the Dfat website on 17 October to remove the previous Morrison government\u2019s language recognising West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. She said that change occurred \u201cahead of government processes\u201d.  There was a mistake made. This was not how we would have dealt with this \u2026 Let\u2019s be clear, a mistake occurred and I\u2019ve taken responsibility for it.  Wong said cabinet made a decision the following morning \u2013 18 October \u2013 to approve the change in government policy. She implied that the decision was fast-tracked to ensure there was no confusion about the government\u2019s position:  Cabinet made a decision that morning \u2026 A mistake was made, I took responsibility for clarifying the government\u2019s position as quickly as possible. I thought that it was best for that to happen and, as a consequence, there were a range of consequences to that, which we\u2019ve discussed. But the decision was made by cabinet on the morning of the announcement. As a consequence, obviously there was not the consultation and advice that would usually occur \u2026 including with Australia\u2019s ambassador to Israel and others and it is not the process we would generally engage in or I have engaged in.  A senior Dfat official told the hearing he had spoken with Australia\u2019s ambassador to Israel, Paul Griffiths, on 17 October, around the time of the media reports. The Dfat official said he had \u201cadvised [the Australian ambassador] what the situation was at that point in time, which at that point in time there was no change in policy\u201d. The following day Israel summoned Griffiths to a meeting to register the Israeli government\u2019s displeasure with the cabinet decision. Asked whether a communications plan had been presented to her office, Wong said:  I think self-evidently the sequence of the events has been well publicised, so it\u2019s pretty obvious there was no communications plan.     Updated at 12.02am GMT     11.44pm GMT       Origin shares soar after $18.4bn takeover bid lobbed Origin Energy shares have jumped by more than a third this morning after it received a takeover bid from Canadian asset manager Brookfield and LNG group MidOcean Energy. Brookfield, you may recall, made a tilt at AGL Energy in February that was rebuffed. (Although Brookfield\u2019s partner in that bid, Mike Cannon-Brookes, later became AGL\u2019s biggest shareholder and will have a big say over that firm\u2019s governance at next week\u2019s AGM.) Anyway, a takeover by Origin would place a big question mark over the timing of the company\u2019s plan to shut Australia\u2019s biggest coal-fired power station, the 2,880-megawatt Eraring plant, in 2025. If the consortium confirms its bid of $9 a share (compared with $5.80 of yesterday), Origin\u2019s board would unanimously support the takeover bid. The current share price, recently at just under $8, has a bit higher to climb by the looks. More to come.

The Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Simon Birmingham, told a Senate estimates hearing that was \u201calso the date that it was first reported by the Guardian\u201d. Birmingham said:  So it was reported within a 24-hour window or even less. Does the department have any idea how the Guardian came to be aware of the change to the website?  The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, quipped:  I can\u2019t speak for the Guardian, I\u2019m afraid. Presumably they have a good monitoring system.  The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told the hearing it was \u201ca deeply sensitive issue for many people in this country and elsewhere\u201d. Wong said the majority of the international community considered the status of Jerusalem was a final status issue to be resolved in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people. She said Labor reinstated the longstanding bipartisan position. Wong reiterated her previous comments that the timing of the announcement was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d. Referring to the website being change prior to the cabinet signing off on the change, Wong said:  A mistake was made. I don\u2019t intend in this hearing or anywhere else to point the finger of blame. I took responsibility as minister to ensure there was clarity around Australia\u2019s position.     Updated at 11.43pm GMT     11.36pm GMT       Identifying greenwashing an \u2018enduring priority\u2019: ACCC Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is asking the ACCC about its focus on \u201cgreenwashing\u201d where it investigates claims made by companies about their green and environmental credentials. Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb says that they are looking across the board, but focusing on claims made to consumers through advertising, with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission focused on the corporate side. Hanson-Young asked about \u201csweeps\u201d of various sectors being undertaken by ACCC to identify misleading environmental claims.  We are very conscious of the importance for the community to actually have trust that claims that are made for environmental sustainability are true.  Cass-Gottlieb said that a sweep undertaken in October aimed to identify which claims were being made in which sectors, and what was the likely verification for such claims being made. She said the preliminary analysis of the ACCC was that there was a \u201chigher prevalence\u201d of potentially misleading content in the sectors of cosmetic and personal care, food and beverage, energy and fashion. Cass-Gottlieb said that identifying greenwashing would be an \u201cenduring priority\u201d for the ACCC.

The hearing has focused on problems with passport processing following the Australian border reopening. The executive director of the Australian Passport Office (APO), Bridget Brill, said officials had anticipated an increase in passport applications after the border reopened, but it \u201cfar exceeded anyone\u2019s expectations\u201d:  We doubled our workforce \u2013 we had already started to upscale our workforce ahead of the border reopening. We predicted we would need to at least double our staffing by May [2022], which we did. On the modelling we had done, based on the data received from the travel industry and other sources, we anticipated we were going to be able to meet the demand based on the modelling.  When asked by the Labor senator Nita Green whether the modelling was wrong, Brill replied:  Correct, Senator. Unfortunately, the surge in travel [and] the wish to travel internationally far exceeded anyone\u2019s expectations around the timing of that. It was around April/May that we got demand that far exceeded what we had modelled across the scenarios. A similar thing played out in the travel sector itself.  The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said that on coming to office \u201cit was very clear to us that there were passport processing delays because the post-Covid surge in applications had been inadequately prepared for\u201d. Wong said the new government had further increased staffing and had now issued 1.4m passports:  I understand Australians\u2019 frustrations about this and staff in this area have worked very hard since the election with us to try and deal with this situation to clear the backlog.  Craig Maclachlan, a Dfat deputy secretary, said the department regretted \u201cthe inconvenience caused to Australian travellers through this processing time\u201d. He said the high point of applications that were \u201con hand\u201d reached 428,000 on 7 September, but as of this week it had fallen to 180,000. He said the average processing time \u201chas dropped from well over 30 days to about 23 days\u201d.    Updated at 11.41pm GMT     10.52pm GMT       Any interactions with Russia at G20 summit to be used to express opposition to \u2018immoral\u2019 invasion: Dfat secretary The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has been asked about Anthony Albanese\u2019s forthcoming attendance at summits, including the G20 in Bali next week. Wong tells the Senate estimates hearing the prime minister \u201cwill be looking to meet with as many counterparts as he is able\u201d but she doesn\u2019t confirm whether that will include China. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, asks whether China has made any direct requests of Australia when it comes to policy, in a series of meetings with Australia since the election. Wong said she did not propose to go into details, and neither did predecessor Marise Payne, of conversations with counterparts \u2013 but Wong added that Australia\u2019s government has changed but its strategic policy interests have not. She said the government would not walk away from Australia\u2019s interests. Wong said the relationship with China \u201chas been in a difficult and challenging place for some time\u201d:  Dealing with that requires a careful considered process and strategy. In part that includes a great deal of thinking about how we publicly articulate and articulate to the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] how we envisage the relationship. In order to [explain] that more clearly, including to the Australian people and publicly, I released my opening statements for each of those two bilaterals publicly ... They are, I think, clear about the issues we were raising on the face of it.  The questions shift to Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s potential attendance at the G20 next week. The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, said the attendance level by Russia was \u201cyet to be made clear\u201d. Adams said Australia would not let down the summit hosts by refusing to attend, but any interactions with Russian delegation would be \u201cvery restricted and will be used to express our clear opposition to the illegal, immoral and unacceptable invasion of Ukraine\u201d. The government has pledged to work with Indonesia on these issues.

That amendment was defeated 79 votes to 57, with Labor and the Greens voting together against it. Crossbenchers Bob Katter, Dai Le, Allegra Spender, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney and Sophie Scamps voted with the Coalition. Procedural amendments from the Liberals and from Spender, who wanted a longer inquiry on some aspects of the bill, were also defeated. The bill got a second reading, with 80 votes to 58. On this vote: Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan voted with the government and the Greens. Spender, Tink, Chaney and Le voted against the second reading. The bill now passes into its consideration in detail phase. The leader of the House and workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, is tabling a new explanatory memorandum with government amendments. These go further than was thought. The new amendments are designed to ensure the \u201cprimacy\u201d of enterprise bargaining (between one employer and its workforce) over multi-employer bargaining. He said:  Under our amendments, employers who have agreed with an employee organisation for a single enterprise agreement are exempt from the single-interest stream.

Updated at 10.47pm GMT     10.39pm GMT       Foreign minister to actively offer briefings to parliamentary committee on China The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says she will actively offer briefings to federal politicians on the relationship with China, saying the previous Morrison government\u2019s reluctance to do so was \u201ca lost opportunity for the nation\u201d. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is up at Senate estimates today. Wong began the session with a pledge to work closely with parliamentarians across the political divide, saying advancing the national interest is a shared responsibility. Australia could deliver a powerful message project through bipartisanship and unity of values:  We need not agree on every government decision. But we should all look to the national interest first rather than partisan political interests. And in pursuit of that purpose we we should seek out ways to better prepare and brief this parliament because our democracy and our country are more robust if parliamentarians are better informed. This was my view as shadow minister and it remains my view as foreign minister. The committee will recall that in opposition I asked the Morrison government to engage the parliament more deeply to help foster unity, especially on the complex issues surrounding Australia\u2019s relationship with China. I believe their refusal was a lost opportunity for the nation and for all of us as custodians of the national interest. So I\u2019m being clear with the committee: I wish to take a different approach. I will routinely offer this committee briefings. If additional briefings are requested I will seek to facilitate those \u2013 and the same applies to parliamentarians generally. And I am pleased to announce a new initiative to start next year, NS23 National Security 23, which will offer national security-related training to parliamentarians \u2013 a collaborative effort between the Australian government and the national security college of the Australian National University.  The recently appointed Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, who is a former Australian ambassador to China and Japan, said she wanted to lift Dfat\u2019s capability:  Conflict comes when diplomacy does not succeed. I therefore see the mission of the department as central to our national interests.  The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, agrees that it is important for Australia to seek bipartisanship on foreign affairs wherever possible, but he also says it is important to scrutinise government decisions.    Updated at 10.44pm GMT     10.33pm GMT       ACCC says wholesale gas and price caps \u2018a possible option\u2019 From Peter Hannam and Sarah Martin: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says it is looking at including legally binding measures to force down prices in gas negotiations as part of a new mandatory code of conduct for the gas sector.  The regulator, which has been tasked by the Treasurer Jim Chalmers to come up with options for the government to consider, has also said that both retail and wholesale price caps are under consideration. Appearing before the Senate economics committee this morning, ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb gave more details of what the regulator was considering, with its advice to go to government by mid November.  She said:  The ACCC has been asked by the Treasurer to give advice, the specific request is directed to looking at the voluntary code of conduct in respect to gas purchase negotiations and advising as to whether there are methods and options to supplement that with the intention of it becoming mandatory, so that there can be an assurance of supply with reference to reasonable pricing.   So far no supplier has signed up the voluntary code, Cass-Gottlieb notes. McKim asked whether the ACCC\u2019s scope had \u201chard boundaries\u201d or whether the regulator could potentially look at capping retail prices.  Cass-Gottlieb said:   The initial part of the requested advice is directed to the sale of the wholesale level between producers and their purchasers who will generally be either gas power generation....commercial and industrial users and retailers, it would not be at the retail price level. [But] we are also asked a second question more generally to advise if there are any regulatory gaps relevant to the current circumstances facing the east coast gas market, so there is a possibility that the second more general one would address that [retail price caps].  McKim also asked whether capping wholesale prices of gas and coal prices was on the table. Cass-Gottleib said:   It is a possible option that we will need to consider in the scale of all possible options. At present we are considering the question really in terms of the scope as framed - we are considering enhancements to what is currently a voluntary code to which no supplier has yet signed, and enhancements that would in legal terms provide greater transparency, certainty and binding outcomes.  Asked by LNP senator Susan McDonald what assumptions were behind the ACCC\u2019s July report that found eastern Australia faced a 56-petajoule shortfall in 2023 and that \u201cevery extra molecule of gas\u201d would be exported, Cass-Gottlieb said it was based on forecasts by the producers themselves. (ACCC \u201cdid not make assumptions\u201d about that export forecast, she added). Of course, what needs to be made clear (but is often skimmed over) is how much gas prices would drop if supply rose since east coast gas prices are linked directly to global ones. Perhaps one of the senators could ask that one.

Khalil is asked where this review into former Australian defence personnel being approached by Beijing leaves diplomatic relations between the two nations:  Any type of dialogue at the leadership level is a good thing. We want to be able to engage with China through dialogue, and it will be a good thing if the prime minister does meet with Xi Jinping. Of course, our foreign minister [Penny Wong] has had multiple conversations with her counterpart, Wang, and our defence minister [Richard Marles] has met with his counterpart as well. That\u2019s good because, for us as Australians, it\u2019s important to do everything that we can to engage in dialogue and diplomacy to reduce tensions that might exist, to address some of the issues around economic sanctions and barriers that have been placed there, and to try and get a good result or good outcomes in that respect. But we\u2019ll always stand up for our values and our position. The prime minister has been very strong on that. He won\u2019t be budged on, you know, our particular commitment to human rights and democracy and our values, but he\u2019s always open to talking to our partners, and it would be a very good thing for that dialogue to occur in some of these international fora in the coming weeks.

Khalil responds to that idea, saying \u201cmore education is always good\u201d but he believes defence personnel\u2019s responsibilities are already made \u201cvery clear\u201d:  Education may be part of the process, absolutely. Having said that, I know for a fact that, having worked in this space in the past, that the responsibilities and the obligations are made very clear to defence personnel, people working in national security agencies, in the commonwealth public service about their responsibilities around sensitive information. I think there is a very strong level of understanding about what your responsibility is during your work, but also outside of your work, and when you leave your work you sign off on a number of documents to confirm that responsibility. So, look, education - more education is always good, but certainly people know what their responsibilities are.

Just how concerned should Australians be about these latest revelations?  Oh, I think very concerned \u2026 there is an enduring obligation, as the minister said, when you leave that service to protect that sensitive information because effectively you\u2019re protecting Australia and fellow Australians. And when you breach that obligation, that enduring obligation, that is really a breach of trust with your fellow Australians, so it\u2019s seriously concerning. The government did move very speedily \u2026 Yesterday [Marles] pointed out there was enough serious concern that he\u2019s gone into a much more detailed examination of the policies and procedures around former defence personnel and the way that framework works. And if there are any weaknesses, he\u2019s going fix them pretty quickly.     Updated at 10.09pm GMT     9.40pm GMT       RBA up before estimates as China clouds gather As noted in an earlier post, the Reserve Bank deputy governor, Michele Bullock, used an evening speech to highlight that inflation is still expected to peak soon, perhaps next month. That\u2019s even with flood impacts on farming pushing up grocery prices and the full whack of energy price increases still to land for many households and businesses. The RBA, meanwhile, will appear before Senate estimates later this morning (after the ACCC kicks off proceedings for the Treasury portfolio), so expect more grilling about whether the central bank should have acted sooner to curb inflation so we wouldn\u2019t be jamming the brakes so hard now. (They\u2019re reviewing their models, and rightly note that most economists didn\u2019t pick Russia\u2019s war, etc.) One thing worth keeping an eye on is the deteriorating Chinese economy amid a sagging property market and rolling Covid-zero policy lockdowns. As we noted in August, China\u2019s economy was showing signs of a big slowdown. We shouldn\u2019t lose sight of this notable stat provided by Michael Pettis, an economist at Peking University*: China\u2019s GDP is roughly three-quarters that of the US and Europe, but the value of property assets are double those in the US and triple those in Europe. The mother of all property bubbles, it seems. Anyway, China\u2019s producer prices fell last month for the first time in almost two years we learnt yesterday, quite at odds with most other parts of the world. Deflation is not a good sign about the health of the local economy. Not surprisingly, then, Bullock cited China as the top uncertainty in the international economy. \u201cA significant concern from our perspective is the downside risks in China,\u201d she said, with the real estate woes at the core. Bullock said:  Residential property sales have declined sharply over the past year, and housing starts have also fallen to be lower than they have been for over a decade.  The way Australia might feel the pinch directly is via lower iron ore prices, but since China is the biggest consumer of most other things dug out of the ground, the implications could end up being a lot wider. However, a flood of goods that can\u2019t be sold at home should ease price pressures in Australia and elsewhere. * \u201cPeking University\u201d is the official name in English, in case you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s not \u201cBeijing University\u201d.

It certainly has some indications and hallmarks of a Russian-based ransomware gang. It does appear, on the face of it, to be criminal in nature at this time. It is certainly true that there is a convergence in between online criminals and nation states. It\u2019s been revealed in previous attacks.  What should Australia be doing?  I think the most important is we have to demonstrate that there\u2019s a cost for this activity. So one thing which we have done in the past is to attribute it because a lot of nation states are uncomfortable being called out on it, China included. We also need to make use of the sanctions within the Magnitsky regime, which we legislated a couple of years ago, which now allows the Australian government to sanction people from [cyber behaviour] that\u2019s never been used. It should be used because I think that will have a powerful disincentive.

Before estimates this week, I discussed with the director general the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), Rachel Noble, whether or not some kind of safe harbour is needed so that in a crisis companies have confidence that they can share information with ASD to help deal with the threat in the immediate aftermath of an attack before they have to start worrying about legal ramifications from the privacy commissioner and others. And Rachel Noble was very supportive of that idea. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s been put to me by industry because they say they are anxious that their companies will think twice about whether they should cooperate to defeat the threat because they\u2019re worried about those legal ramifications and those fines. And, if that is the case, that\u2019s very unproductive and it will stall or an effective response to these crises.     Updated at 9.30pm GMT     9.23pm GMT       Opposition says if new Medicare card numbers needed, government should pay The shadow minister for cyber security and countering foreign interference, James Paterson, follows Bill Shorten on ABC radio, giving his two cents on this latest news of the Medibank data leak. Paterson says he welcomes the measures the government has put in place, including supporting state police. He goes on to say there are \u201cother things that government will need to contemplate in the coming days and weeks\u201d:  My No 1 focus today is Medibank customers who will be very distressed by the news that their data appears to be leaked on the web by the hackers. They\u2019ve made good on their threat, unfortunately. This is the worst-case scenario. There are other things that government will need to contemplate in the coming days and weeks. For example, as we saw in the Optus case, where the government issued identification, like Medicare numbers need to be reissued. If that\u2019s the case, that should be done free and, it should be done promptly.     Updated at 9.26pm GMT     9.18pm GMT       Shorten urges victims of data breach to \u2018contact us\u2019 to replace government ID NDIS minister Bill Shorten is asked about data breaches after the latest Medibank leak as part of his ABC Radio interview. Shorten supports Medibank not giving into ransom demands, saying this would \u201cincentivise it happening\u201d:  In terms of people whose ID is compromised, where it\u2019s government identification, contact us, so we can help replace it and help change it.  Patricia Karvelas:  Will that be free of charge?  Shorten:  Yes, for the person.     Updated at 9.21pm GMT     9.05pm GMT    'US$1 per customer': Medibank ransom claim    The hackers allegedly behind the theft of Medibank data linked to 9.7 million customers have revealed they allegedly demanded a US$1 per customer ransom from the health insurer. In a chilling message posted on the dark web overnight, the ransomware group also claimed it had released sensitive details of customers\u2019 medical procedures. The post said:  Added one more file abortions.csv ... Society ask us about ransom, it\u2019s a 10 millions usd. We can make discount 9.7m 1$=1 customer.  The group began releasing Medibank data on the dark web in the early hours of Wednesday morning under \u201cgood-list\u201d and \u201cnaughty-list\u201d. The first wave included names, birthdates, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, health claims information, Medicare numbers for Medibank\u2019s ahm customers and passport numbers for international student clients. Medibank confirmed on Wednesday:  The files appear to be a sample of the data that we earlier determined was accessed by the criminal. We expect the criminal to continue to release files on the dark web.  Medibank revealed this week it had rejected hacker demands it pay a ransom in return for the data not being released. Asked what people should do if they were contacted by someone claiming to have sensitive information about them, federal minister Annika Wells reiterated the government\u2019s advice was not to pay ransoms. She told Nine Network today:  You do not pay the ransom. You\u2019re making the assumption that that is true and what we\u2019re saying is that may not necessarily be the case \u2013 plenty of scumbags out there are going to try and make the most of this situation.  Medibank had warned more customer data would be uploaded to the dark web, which is what appears to have happened in the early hours of Thursday. Australian federal police are ramping up efforts to catch those behind the huge data breach. \u2013 from AAP    Updated at 9.15pm GMT     9.02pm GMT       Coalition\u2019s staff cap has fuelled lack of payment integrity, Shorten says Bill Shorten goes on to criticise the NDIS staff cap implemented by the Coalition government:  When there were 180,000 participants in the scheme, the staff numbers were around 3,500 to 4,000. And the government of the day said, \u2018OK, no more staff.\u2019 Now the scheme has half a million people-plus, and what\u2019s happened is that we\u2019ve brought in contractors or labour hire or partners in the community and the scheme hasn\u2019t been well, in my opinion, supervised and well loved. And as a result you know, the payment system. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s sufficient scrutiny on the invoices that gets submitted for services which are provided. We\u2019re going to have to put more effort into payment integrity, more effort into monitoring the invoices.     Updated at 9.14pm GMT     8.54pm GMT       \u2018It was to be a 50/50 split\u2019 RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks Bill Shorten if that means he thinks some of those kids shouldn\u2019t be on the NDIS. Shorten:  I don\u2019t blame someone for seeking to get support for the child. What does make me wonder is the state school systems providing the support for kids with developmental and learning delays? Are they doing enough or not? How can you force their hand to do it so that these people aren\u2019t going on the NDIS? Originally, when the NDIS was created, it was to be a 50/50 split, at the moment the federal government is paying 64% to 66% of the scheme and states are paying in the mid 30s.     Updated at 9.05pm GMT     8.51pm GMT       NDIS \u2018can\u2019t be the only lifeboat in the ocean\u2019, Shorten says Bill Shorten goes on to say that the distribution of responsibilities for funding needs to be distributed more evenly with other bodies like state governments stepping up, so the burden doesn\u2019t only fall on the government scheme:  I also think there\u2019s a challenge with the state\u2019s what\u2019s happened is now the NDIS exists, everything becomes an NDIS matter. It can\u2019t afford to be the only lifeboat in the ocean for people with a disability. [The NDIS] was designed for the most profoundly and severely impaired Australians, not for everyone with a disability. All of the coverage of it looks at the cost and that\u2019s legitimate, but it\u2019s not cost in a vacuum. We are seeing improvements is half a million people who for the first time in many cases, most cases are receiving support, which previously fell to a crisis-driven system. So this is an investment and it\u2019s delivering good returns with more kids getting better results in terms of our education. There\u2019s more people with disabilities participating in work. We\u2019re seeing improvement in terms of the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of people and their families.     Updated at 9.03pm GMT     8.42pm GMT       Bill Shorten addresses NDIS cost blowouts  The minister for the NDIS, Bill Shorten, is speaking to ABC Radio this morning about those cost blowouts to the disability scheme of up to $100bn a year predicted in last month\u2019s budget. ABC Radio asks Shorten if the rapid growth in participants has been driving the blowouts:  The scheme hasn\u2019t been well managed in the nine years. There\u2019s a variety of reasons why the scheme is growing at the rate it is. There are certainly more kids coming onto the scheme than was originally forecast. So that\u2019s true. But just the point about those kids, they tend to be pretty minimal cost. So, it is a factor but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the only feature, what I do think is that there has been clunky decision making within the organisation, there\u2019s been a lack of attention on the payment side \u2026 In other words, what service providers are charging, who\u2019s taken the scheme for a lend? My focus is not that people with disabilities, profound disabilities, are doing the wrong thing. They\u2019re not. I do think there is rent-seeking behaviour by some providers, and not all of them, but some of them.     Updated at 9.03pm GMT     8.35pm GMT    Defence reveals \u2018rotten egg gas\u2019 problem in Pacific patrol boats    Department of Defence officials say they are hoping to fix problems with the Guardian-class patrol boats in coming weeks after revealing an \u201congoing issue\u201d with hydrogen sulphide from the vessels\u2019 waste management systems. Australia has so far given 15 Guardian-class patrol vessels to regional neighbours, starting with the delivery of one to Papua New Guinea in November 2018, but the government announced four months ago that it had found a number of problems, including carbon monoxide entering part of the boat. Hugh Jeffrey from the Department of Defence mentioned the hydrogen sulphide issue during questioning by the Greens senator David Shoebridge at a Senate estimates hearing last night. Hydrogen sulfide, or H2S, is a colourless toxic gas that can smell like rotten eggs:  As with all new capabilities, we have some maintenance issues. There has been a specific issue in relation to H2S, a toxic gas, created by the ship\u2019s grey-water and black-water systems. We\u2019ve been working this issue intensively with Austal, the ship manufacturer. They have been committed to resolving this, as have we, and they\u2019re currently trialling steps to improve the robustness of the grey-water and black-water sewerage systems on those boats.  The head of maritime systems, Rear Admiral Wendy Malcolm, said Austal was \u201cworking in Cairns at the moment to trial those [steps] and subsequent to those trials proving effective over the next two to three weeks, we will look to roll out those fixes across the fleet\u201d. She said safety was \u201cabsolutely paramount\u201d. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, added that the patrol boats were \u201ca very important part of Australia\u2019s engagement with and support to the Pacific\u201d and the government was committed to fixing the problems as quickly as possible. Last week an Austal spokesperson provided Guardian Australia with an update on the other issues:  Working with our component suppliers, Austal has rectified both the engine muffler and the Vulcan Engine Coupling, and also supported the Commonwealth in optimising the design to improve ventilation in the sick bay.

This is significant because Cosboa gave conditional support for more options for multi-employer bargaining before the jobs and skills summit, signing up with the Australian Council of Trade Unions in a move that allowed workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, to say there was consensus for the idea. Consensus no more. The employers said the bill \u201cwould introduce fundamental and highly problematic changes to Australia\u2019s bargaining system that would be detrimental to Australia\u201d:  The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Australian Industry Group; Business Council of Australia; Minerals Council of Australia; the Cosboa; and National Farmers Federation are united in a call for the Government to either abandon or substantially amend various contentious elements of the bill relating to bargaining. The bill, as currently framed, should not be passed by Parliament. We jointly call on the Government to permit time for a thorough consideration of the content and implications of the Bill. This deeper consideration should include removing the provisions to allow widespread use of multi-employer bargaining backed by strike action. The Australian Parliament should remain open to making further amendments. The legislation as drafted does not reflect broad consensus arising out of engagement with industry at the Jobs and Skills Summit or subsequent consultation. It is crucial these proposals are thoroughly examined.  The council said national employer associations were particularly concerned that the bill:  unjustifiably expands the scope for multi-employer bargaining; fails to articulate clear parameters around where multi-employer bargaining would be available in either the supported bargaining or single-interest streams; and undermines the system of enterprising bargaining that has delivered many significant benefits to Australia over several decades and currently operates effectively in many sectors.   The currently proposed framework for arbitrating bargaining disputes also risks unreasonably subjecting broad sectors of the economy, and community, to the centralised setting of terms and conditions over and above the comprehensive system of modern awards already in place.  The government is being urged to address \u201cadditional deficiencies\u201d in the bill and to allow \u201cdetailed examination of the multi-employer bargaining elements\u201d.

RBA deputy governor Michele Bullock said in a speech last night that the situation in Europe remained clouded in uncertainty, AAP reports:  While gas prices have declined lately, they are expected to rise again, particularly if there is an unusually cold winter or Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine escalates further.  Speaking in Sydney, Bullock said high global energy prices boost Australia\u2019s export earnings as a major coal and gas exporter \u2013 but also put upwards pressure on prices. The government has flagged regulatory intervention in the energy markets to keep gas and electricity prices down, after the October budget revealed they are expected to soar by a combined 50% over the next two financial years. Bullock said the bank had built a substantial hike in energy prices into its outlook for the economy but said \u201cthere is a risk we haven\u2019t incorporated enough\u201d:  On the other side of the coin, however, global supply chain pressures are easing quite quickly and that could turn out to be more of a dampening force than we are currently expecting.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer, bringing you the early headlines before Natasha May takes control. There are two big foreign stories overnight that we should look at to begin with. First, the Republicans have failed to secure the resounding victories in the US midterm elections that were widely expected. Democrats did much better than predicted, leaving control of Congress in the balance. That\u2019s also bad news for Donald Trump who reportedly fumed in his Mar-a-Lago lair as he watched several of his high-profile backers go down to defeat. Follow all the latest at our US election live blog. The second big story is that the Kremlin has ordered its troops to withdraw from Kherson. The Ukrainian city was the first large target captured by the Russians at the beginning of their invasion and their withdrawal is a huge blow to President Vladimir Putin. You can follow those developments here. At home, a poll shows that almost 90% of people want the government to do something about energy bills, either through export controls or a windfall profits tax, or both. It comes after Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy also backed the need for intervention in the energy sector. Interesting as well that RBA deputy governor Michele Bullock said in a speech last night that the situation in Europe remained clouded in uncertainty and that energy prices could rise rapidly again. And we\u2019ve also got a cracking story from the campaign trail in Victoria where it has emerged that deputy Liberal leader David Southwick has used his campaign manager and a part-time staffer in campaign ads to attract young voters \u2013 without declaring that they work for him.

This cancellation decision was made on health, safety and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so. I welcome the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe. As I said on Friday, Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected. Over the pandemic, together we have achieved one of the lowest death rates, strongest economies and highest vaccination rates, in the world. Strong borders are fundamental to the Australian way of life as is the rule of law. Our Government has always understood this and has been prepared to take the decisions and actions necessary to protect the integrity of our borders. I thank the Court for their prompt attention to these issues and the patience of all involved as we have worked to resolve this issue.

Australia\u2019s strong border protection policies have kept us safe during the pandemic, resulting in one of the lowest death rates, strongest economic recoveries, and highest vaccination rates in the world. Strong border protection policies are also fundamental to safe-guarding Australia\u2019s social cohesion which continues to strengthen despite the pandemic. Australians have made great sacrifices to get to this point and the Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting this position, as the Australian people expect. To date around 43 million vaccination doses have been administered in Australia and more than 91.6% of Australians aged 16 years and over are fully vaccinated. Accordingly, Australia has been able to commence a step-by-step, safe reopening of its international border as a result of this successful vaccination program.        7.56am GMT       There\u2019s not been an update to the Australian Open schedule of play for tomorrow reflecting that the number one seed is probably going to be on a plane back to Serbia, but this is a good suggestion:    Yes.

Kristina Keneally, the shadow minister for immigration, said in a statement:  Scott Morrison has made himself a laughing stock on the world stage through a litany of failures as he and his Government mishandled Novak Djokovic\u2019s case, undermined Australia\u2019s border security settings, and provided a lightning rod for the anti-vaccination movement. The Morrison Government\u2019s own argument before the court was that Mr Djokovic\u2019s visa should be cancelled because his presence here may foster anti-vaccination sentiment based on what he did and said before he was granted a visa.  This must prompt the question, why did Mr Morrison\u2019s Government grant him a visa to come to Australia in the first place?  This mess is not a failure of our laws. It is a failure of the Morrison Government\u2019s competence and leadership.  Australians have made all the hard sacrifices during lock downs, only for Mr Morrison and his Government to serve up an embarrassing and farcical series of unforced errors after they foolishly granted Mr Djokovic a visa 60 days ago.         7.14am GMT       Here\u2019s who is possibly replacing Djokovic in the Australian Open.

It was about whether the decision was so irrational or unreasonable that it wasn&#39;t made lawfully. A tricky, but crucial, distinction.&mdash; Hannah Ryan (@HannahD15) January 16, 2022         7.02am GMT    Djokovic to be deported    Novak Djokovic will be deported from Australia ahead of the Australian Open after the full federal court dismissed the world No 1\u2019s bid to restore his visa. On Sunday the court upheld the decision of Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to cancel the visa on the basis Djokovic\u2019s presence in Australia might risk \u201ccivil unrest\u201d as he is a \u201ctalisman of anti-vaccination sentiment\u201d. The chief justice, James Allsop, announced the court unanimously dismissed Djokovic\u2019s application, with costs, but explained the decision of the court did not reflect on \u201c the merits or wisdom of the decision\u201d. Full reasons will follow at a later date. The full story is here:   Related: Novak Djokovic to be deported from Australia after losing appeal against visa cancellation      Updated at 7.05am GMT     7.00am GMT       It is a huge blow for Djokovic: the court\u2019s decision was unanimous, and he is ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.       6.59am GMT       But to make it clear: this decision means that Djokovic\u2019s visa has been cancelled and he is to be deported. He faces a three-year ban from returning, except in certain circumstances, that can include \u201ccompelling circumstances that affect the interests of Australia\u201d.

Updated at 6.45am GMT     6.35am GMT    Queensland quarantine facility set to open within weeks    I have just realised, because of the report below, that the Queensland government has built its regional quarantine facility at a place called Wellcamp. Wishful thinking? This from AAP: Border restrictions may be easing but the Queensland government is confident its regional quarantine facility can still be used for \u201can array of options\u201d. The finishing touches are being put on the centre at Wellcamp, west of Brisbane, which is set to open in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d. The 500-bed opening stage is almost complete with the administration and reception set to be finished while the rest of the 1000-bed centre is expected to be unveiled by April. The federal government is building another 1000-bed quarantine camp in Pinkenba, near Brisbane airport, like similar centres in Melbourne and Perth. However, the Queensland Opposition has questioned the value of the Wellcamp facility outside Toowoomba with quarantine requirements easing. Domestic travellers have been able to enter from 1am on Saturday without showing proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Fully jabbed international arrivals won\u2019t need to quarantine once the state hits 90 per cent vaccination rate, a target set to be reached in coming days. But Deputy Premier Steven Miles said there would still be a need for the quarantine facility. \u201cClearly over time the usage of a facility like that is going to change as we have met our vaccination targets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there will continue to be a need for quarantine for some arrivals as well as other cohorts. \u201cThroughout the last two years there have been a wide variety of times where we have needed suitable, appropriate, custom-built accommodation. \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t need it but I expect that we will. We are just working through which cohorts would be best to utilise that facility.\u201d Chief health officer John Gerrard said the Wellcamp facility was as important as ever. \u201cThere are quite an array of options that facility will enable us to do,\u201d he said.    Updated at 6.43am GMT     6.29am GMT    Djokovic decision announced at 5.45pm    An email has just been sent by the federal court, confirming the time, that reasons will come later, and also that the broadcast of the decision can be carried live by media outlets and recorded.

The bureau updated its tsunami warning at 4.57pm, and it remains current for the coasts of NSW, Lord Howe Island, and Norfolk Island. All beaches are closed. But there\u2019s been a couple of interesting additions: reports of two new \u201ctsunami impacts in NSW\u201d recorded today. The BoM write that there were reports of a \u201cmass rescue due to the sudden drop in tide\u201d at Sawtell, near Coffs Harbour, at 3.53pm AEDT, and of dangerous tidal movements at Gunnamatta Bay and Maroubra between 2.30pm and 3.30pm AEDT.       6.03am GMT       Here\u2019s a full story on health minister Greg Hunt\u2019s comments from earlier today that Omicron cases may have peaked in NSW and the ACT:   Related: Australia Covid update: Greg Hunt says Omicron may be peaking as NSW warned \u2018difficult three weeks\u2019 ahead         5.56am GMT       Widely mocked plans to establish a tropical haven for cryptocurrency enthusiasts have run into trouble after a contract to buy an island in Fiji for US$12m fell through, Ben Butler reports.

The CHO, Dr John Gerrard, said people in Queensland have been calling triple zero asking where to get a rapid antigen test. Via AAP: While confident the state\u2019s hospitals could cope, Dr Gerrard has urged Queenslanders with mild COVID-19 symptoms not to dial triple zero, in order to ease pressure on the ambulance service. He said:   We have had a lot of calls...for very minor aspects...people even calling the ambulance centres asking where to get a RAT test.  He said emergency calls should only be made if people had difficulty breathing, significant chest pain or were coughing up blood.       5.25am GMT       Here\u2019s the rundown of the Covid situation in Queensland, via AAP: Three people have died from COVID-19 in Queensland, with the state recording another 17,455 new cases as the number of people in hospital continues to \u201ccreep up\u201d. But chief health officer John Gerrard is confident the state\u2019s health care system can handle the rising case numbers despite conceding some south-east Queensland hospitals are \u201cunder pressure\u201d. Queensland\u2019s COVID-19 death toll has reached 29 after a person in their 60s, another in their 80s and a 103-year-old became the latest fatalities. Two had a single dose and the other was double jabbed but all had underlying medical conditions. The new cases recorded included results from 4,615 rapid antigen tests, with a total of 42,420 tests in a 24 hour period. There are 203,657 active cases in Queensland. Dr Gerrard said there are 670 people in hospital across the state - up from 649 on Saturday - with 49 in intensive care, an increase of three in the past 24 hours. Sixteen people are on ventilators. \u201cThis (state\u2019s hospital numbers) continues to creep up from yesterday,\u201d Dr Gerrard said. He said he felt for south-east Queensland hospitals dealing with case surges and staff shortages with the majority of the state\u2019s ICU patients - \u201cabout 20-odd\u201d - on the Gold Coast. Overall 2,643 Queensland health staff have COVID-19 with 2,835 in quarantine. \u201cThe biggest pressure at the moment is at the Gold Coast and the south Brisbane hospitals,\u201d Dr Gerrard said. \u201cThere is no doubt they are under pressure and my thoughts are with the staff at those hospitals looking after significant numbers of patients. \u201c(But) we have the capacity for looking after patients in the thousands. Our modelling suggests with assistance of private hospitals we will be able to absorb the load.\u201d       5.17am GMT       Australian Open organisers have scheduled Novak Djokovic to play his first round match after Ash Barty\u2019s on Rod Laver Arena tomorrow night.    #AusOpen Order of Play - Monday 17 January \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/snv6OMoJcD&mdash; #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 16, 2022         5.08am GMT    Man shot after allegedly firing gun at Tasmania police    There has been a gun fight between police and a man in Tasmania, AAP report: Police have shot a gunman in the shoulder after he allegedly fired at officers with a shotgun in Tasmania\u2019s northwest. Officers were called to a property in Shorewell Park, near Burnie, about 8:30am on Sunday after reports an armed man was acting aggressively, making threats and firing a weapon. Police said they tried to negotiate with the 25-year-old, urging him to disarm himself. He allegedly fired at police before being shot in the shoulder by officers. He was taken into custody at the scene, given first aid and taken to hospital. Western District Commander Debbie Williams said the man is in a stable condition and is expected to undergo surgery on Sunday afternoon. \u201cWe would like to thank the local community for their assistance as we carry out our investigations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe appreciate their patience and understanding.\u201d The Tasmania police professional standards unit has been advised and will investigate the incident.

Well worth a read.     UPDATED: Novak Djokovic\u2019s bid to stay in Australia and defend his Australian Open title will be decided in hours, as the full federal court adjourned to consider the world No. 1\u2019s last-ditch legal challengehttps://t.co/gQAtRq2GBS&mdash; Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) January 16, 2022         4.38am GMT       Shadow health minister Mark Butler spoke to reporters a little earlier. He was asked about the Djokovic saga.  He said:   This has been an embarrassing soap opera of Scott Morrison\u2019s making. If Mr Djokovi\u0107 did not satisfy the entry test to come into Australia, he should not have been granted a visa way back in November. Frankly, at a time when we are dealing with tens of thousands of cases every day, dozens of deaths, we don\u2019t need a government spending time, energy and money dealing with this soap opera day, upon day, upon day. I think Australians want this soap opera brought to an end one way or the other and for the government to get on with its job of protecting Australians in this disastrous fourth wave.        4.25am GMT       The reports emerging out of Tonga, while patchy due to internet outages, do not sound good. My colleague Joshua Mcdonald has filed this report:  Tsunami waves caused by an undersea volcano have flooded the Pacific Island country of Tonga, where entire towns have been inundated with water and scientists warn the main island could be blanketed in volcanic ash. Videos shared on social media after the eruption showed people running for higher ground as the one metre high floods hit coastal areas and made their way farther inland while the sky darkened with ash. A video shot from the roof of a building on the coast showed large waves breaching the coastal wall seconds apart, while a video shot from the New Zealand high commission in Nuku\u2019alofa, where people ran for shelter, showed the downtown area of Patangata had been completely submerged, including the Royal Palace and Tonga\u2019s largest bank. Another video, shot inside a church, showed children crying out as water surrounded the building and waves begin lapping up against the windows. In a video posted to YouTube after the eruption, Abraham Leilua begins by telling his followers that \u201cit\u2019s not that bad\u201d but within minutes, as the water rises, saying: \u201cI have to run for my life\u201d before ending the video.    Related: Tsunami from Tonga volcano eruption leaves trail of flood damage         4.21am GMT    Signs Omicron peaking NSW and ACT: Hunt    Health minister Greg Hunt says there are clear signs that the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is peaking, according to AAP. He told reporters earlier today:  There are signs that NSW in particular and the ACT maybe peaking. I won\u2019t call it as having reached it yet, but in particular what we\u2019ve seen, is that all of these jurisdictions have so far significantly undershot the hospitalisation, ICU and ventilation predictions that were made at the outset.        3.57am GMT    Government says Djokovic 'icon' of anti-vax movement, tennis star accuses government of 'irrational' error    So, as we await the decision, it\u2019s worth recapping what we\u2019ve just heard.   Djokovic\u2019s lawyers accused the government of making an irrational and erroneous decision to cancel his visa on public order grounds. The government\u2019s decision was based on the risk that his continued presence would excite anti-vaccination sentiment. But Djokovic argued the government failed comprehensively to consider the \u201ccounter-factual\u201d to that, namely, what would be the effect on anti-vaccination sentiment of deporting Djokovic? They said this error was \u201cperverse\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d, given the government had singled out the potential of fostering anti-vaccination sentiment as its chief concern about Djokovic\u2019s presence in the country.  In response, lawyers for immigration minister Alex Hawke said he clearly did consider the impact of deporting Djokovic on anti-vaccination sentiment, but decided his continued presence in the country was too risky, particularly because the current debate had highlighted his anti-vaccination views and made him an \u201cicon\u201d to anti-vaccination groups. They also argued Australia must not \u201cbe bound to suffer\u201d a person\u2019s presence due to fear of what would happen if they were removed.  Djokovic\u2019s lawyers accused the government of making \u201celementary\u201d mistakes in its reliance on news articles to link Djokovic with anti-vaccination groups in Australia, despite those news articles making no such connections themselves. The government also took a BBC report about Djokovic\u2019s anti-vaccination views, used as evidence of his opposition to the Covid vaccination, out of context, Djokovic argued. Djokovic also accused the government of failing to ask him what his current views on vaccination were. In response, the government said it was unlikely Djokovic would have told them anything new.  Djokovic said there was no evidence that he had excited anti-vaccination sentiment in any of the other tennis tournaments he had played in since the vaccine was distributed. His lawyers said the government failed to collect any evidence about this, despite it being easily available.  The chief justice, James Allsop, intervened to make an observation that was helpful for the immigration minister\u2019s case. Djokovic\u2019s lawyers have been focused on the lack of \u201cevidence\u201d before Alex Hawke of the impact of his presence in Australia. Allsop said the minister was entitled to rely on his common sense. The court is likely to indicate its decision to the parties later today, but will not publish full reasons.      One more point to be made. It is a great step forward for open justice that the federal court has allowed this case to be watched by the public in such a seamless fashion. Most other Australian courts make it prohibitively difficult to watch proceedings remotely.     Just quietly, the live streaming of this important case, together with all its commentary on Twitter and elsewhere, is an outstanding result for #openjustice in Australia #Auslaw https://t.co/n3NXFuGVui&mdash; Matt Lewis (@lewis_adhoc) January 15, 2022      Updated at 4.04am GMT     3.38am GMT    Federal court expected to hand down decision this afternoon    The submissions are now done. Chief justice James Allsop says the court will adjourn. He says the court won\u2019t be able to give full reasons for any decision today. But he says the court hopes to be in a position to indicate what it is proposing to do later this afternoon.   What we would hope to do is to spend the afternoon hopefully, and perhaps the early evening, dealing with the arguments that have been put to the court, not with a view to delivering full reasons today, but with a view if possible as to reach a view as to the outcome of the matter and on one hypothesis, if it be relevant, Mr Lloyd, the individual basis for it.  We would hope to do that later in the afternoon. So in a sense we\u2019re not asking counsel and solicitors to stand down in their present positions as it were. But we would hope to be in a position to indicate to the parties later in the afternoon what we propose to do.      Updated at 3.45am GMT     3.34am GMT       Nicholas Wood in his reply responded to the minister\u2019s claim that he shouldn\u2019t be \u201cbound\u201d to keep someone in Australia based on the consequences if they were removed. Wood said, effectively, of course if the minister had been more reasonable he could have removed a troublesome visa-holder. Stephen Lloyd is not happy. He says that Djokovic\u2019s case in written submissions was that the minister hadn\u2019t considered the effect if Djokovic is deported, but his counsel now seems to be arguing \u201ceven if he did consider it he was unreasonable in what he did\u201d. Lloyd says this is a \u201cdifferent ground\u201d that they weren\u2019t warned of. Wood says no, it\u2019s not a new case, it\u2019s simply restatement that it was not considered and that made the decision unreasonable. Chief justice James Allsop observes if the court finds the minister did consider it \u2013 the first ground would fail. Wood agrees. Phew, glad we got that straight.    Updated at 3.37am GMT     3.29am GMT       Wood says they are seeking Djokovic to be released within 30 minutes of a decision being made, if the court does find against the minister.        3.17am GMT       That concludes the submissions from Stephen Lloyd, representing the minister.  Nicholas Wood, acting for Djokovic, is now replying. He promises to be brief.        3.15am GMT    Djokovic has become 'icon' for anti-vaccination groups in Australia: government    The chief justice James Allsop, who previously observed that the immigration minister could use his common sense, just made another intervention that indicates how hard it will be for Djokovic to win. Allsop said:  What\u2019s put against you, Mr Wood is saying where\u2019s the evidence, you have to have the facts? We could\u2019ve had examples in other places in the last year, of people following his lead.  [There are] two categories: one being taken up by those who have strong anti vaccination views, but the second is a much broader concept of an iconic sports star setting an example that is not wished to be followed.  As I understand your submission, the notion you need to lead evidence of what effect he might have in the US or somewhere else is beside point. You can use common sense and human intuition about how people behave. If Mr Djokovic won the Open \u2013 there\u2019s an example, embedded in the minister\u2019s reasons, for young and not so young fans of tennis.  Lloyd makes the point that Djokovic, right now, had become an \u201cicon\u201d for anti-vaccination groups in Australia, given the current debate about his presence.    More importantly and more recently, perhaps inevitably because of recent events, the applicant\u2019s views or widely understood views about vaccination have come to the fore, they are right in people\u2019s minds at the moment.  He has now become an icon for the anti-vaccination groups and then what role that will have if somebody of his significance being present in Australia at a time when that is an issue. The minister clearly sees there is a risk... in the same way that Mr Djokovic associates himself with a whole array of products and no doubt, because of his popularity and status, that does well for people who engage him for his endorsements, in the same way rightly or wrongly he is perceived to have engaged with an anti-vaccination view.        Updated at 3.36am GMT     3.06am GMT       Lloyd has also denied there is any contradiction in immigration minister Alex Hawke, on the one hand, saying Djokovic has well-known anti-vaccination views, while also conceding he did not ask the tennis star what his current views are.  Lloyd accuses Djokovic\u2019s lawyers of misreading that part of the minister\u2019s decision.  It has to be read as a whole. He doesn\u2019t say... that he doesn\u2019t have a view about what Mr Djokovic\u2019s views on vaccinations were, he just says he didn\u2019t ask for an update on what his present view was.      Updated at 3.09am GMT     3.03am GMT       You may have noticed that the Australian Open is yet to release its schedule for the tournament\u2019s first day, which is ... tomorrow.  Tennis writer Ben Rothenberg says the delay is at odds with prior tournaments.     Doing some digging into precedents, it seems clear that the Djokovic deportation is delaying the #AusOpen scheduling release considerably.In both 2017 + 2018, the Day 1 OOP was released on Saturday evening; it&#39;s now Sunday afternoon.This is holding the other players in limbo.&mdash; Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) January 16, 2022      Updated at 3.04am GMT     2.59am GMT    Djokovic wouldn't have shared vaccination views, even if asked, government says    Lloyd is hitting back at allegations the government failed to seek Djokovic\u2019s current views on vaccination and relied on outdated comments, taken out of context. Lloyd says Djokovic wouldn\u2019t have told the minister anyway.   There is no evidence before the court that the applicant could or would have put forward any useful information to the minister, had his views been sought.      Updated at 3.11am GMT     2.58am GMT       Lloyd has responded to Novak Djokovic\u2019s lawyers asking for evidence about the impact of his alleged anti-vax views by citing low vaccination rates in Serbia. Lloyd said it would be in Serbia one would expect Djokovic\u2019s stance to have the biggest impact, and on the evidence:   In Djokovic\u2019s home country ... under half the country is fully vaccinated against Covid.  Lloyd said he doesn\u2019t think Alex Hawke needs to prove that impact \u2013 but there was evidence in front of him about it.    Updated at 3.05am GMT     2.51am GMT    Australia must not 'be bound to suffer' person's presence due to fear of their removal    Lloyd is continuing to defend the government\u2019s consideration of the effects of deporting Djokovic. He says there is nothing in the law to suggest, as Djokovic does, that failing to consider a counter-factual makes a minister\u2019s decision \u201cirrational or unreasonable\u201d.  It doesn\u2019t follow from the minister failing to consider a counter-factual, if that\u2019s what the court finds, that he transgressed the bounds of reasonableness.   He also says:  Australia must not be bound to suffer the presence of an alien for fear of what might happen if they were removed.  Lloyd says the minister was aware of the presence of anti-vaccination groups in Australia, the fact they \u201cidolised\u201d Djokovic, would react angrily to his visa cancellation, and that the decision would lead to media coverage.     Updated at 2.53am GMT     2.43am GMT       We\u2019re back on in the federal court.  The chief justice, James Allsop, has come back and posed a lengthy question about what the minister did and didn\u2019t do to consider the risk posed by deporting Djokovic.  Allsop said:  It might be that you are correct to the effect that much of this can be seen in submissions the existence of other groups that may have an anti vax predisposition or view, the possibility of antagonism about the withdrawal or cancellation of visa. One can on this hypothesis, one can readily accept your submissions that this kind of problem was in a sense, within the submissions that the minister in a case such of this we would hardly infer that he didn\u2019t read. That said \u2013 what he didn\u2019t do on one view is finely balance the weighing of them. The answer to that may be he didn\u2019t have to. One can see a lack of balancing of one against the other, without denying the notion that he was alive to problems in the future if he did cancel. Then one goes back to the statutory task, what consequence there is if he understood aspects of the future but did not finally weigh the alternative binary detriments.  Stephen Lloyd, replied that the possibility of unrest if Djokovic were deported \u201cmust have been part of consideration of balance\u201d.       2.27am GMT       And here comes Christopher Knaus, fresh from lunch.

While more people are dying than at any time during the pandemic, Mr Perrottet says it appears the crisis is in fact tracking better than expected. NSW hospitals are now caring for 2650 COVID-19 patients. Of these, 191 are in intensive care beds. At the depths of the Delta outbreak last September, there were 244 virus-infected people in ICUs. Recent worst-case scenario modelling suggested 6000 people would be hospitalised at the apex of the outbreak, with 10 per cent of those patients in intensive care. Even the best-case predictions painted a grimmer picture than reality, allowing for almost 3160 people in care. Mr Perrottet says a full re-assessment of the forecast data will be conducted later in the week. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the last two years and we\u2019ll get through Omicron as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a highly vaccinated population, we have a less severe disease but one that is more contagious and it is pleasing to see that those numbers aren\u2019t increasing at an exponential rate.\u201d Mr Perrottet says while the state is 95 per cent vaccinated, around half the patients in intensive care are not. Of the 191, 61 currently require ventilation. \u201cSo the evidence, the facts, are very, very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cVaccination helps protect you and your family and your friends and the wider community. So please continue to make that effort.\u201d Some 93.8 per cent of all NSW adults are now double dosed, while 25.4 per cent have also received a booster, representing about 47 per cent of those eligible. Of children aged 5-11, 11.5 per cent have had a single dose of vaccine.    Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned people not to forget the importance of a third jab.\u201cThe booster is showing itself to be one of the vital tools in pushing back against the evil of this virus,\u201d he urged. \u201cIt ... does make a huge difference to both ensuring you can fight back ... and reducing the likelihood you\u2019ll end up in hospital. \u201cIt definitely reduces the likelihood you\u2019ll end up in ICU and reduces the chance of death\u201d. Mr Perrottet also apologised for ongoing disruptions to food supply networks and delays at PCR testing sites, saying the latter had now begun to \u201clargely resolve and subside\u201d.    Updated at 2.17am GMT     1.54am GMT    Victoria receives first batch of 3m rapid antigen tests as state records 28,128 new cases    Here\u2019s the full wrap of the Covid situation in Victoria, via AAP: Victoria has received a \u201csignificant\u201d first batch of three million rapid antigen tests, which will soon be handed out to the state\u2019s essential workers, people with pre-existing conditions and community groups. The state posted 28,128 new COVID-19 infections and another 13 deaths on Sunday, as hospitalisations with the virus continue to climb. Premier Daniel Andrews announced the state\u2019s \u201csignificant first batch\u201d of three million RATs has arrived, from a bulk order of 44 million. They will be distributed to essential workers in health and aged care, disability and emergency services from Monday. Victorians with pre-existing conditions, that make them susceptible to severe illness, will also be prioritised for a RAT to ensure they are diagnosed so that care can be quickly provided. Additionally, 60 community and multi-faith organisations would receive a \u201cmodest but important\u201d portion of the free RATs, to be handed out in a culturally appropriate way, Mr Andrews said. \u201cThree million is a very important start, we are working very hard to make sure that each and every one of the orders that make up the 44 million are honoured,\u201d he told reporters on Sunday. \u201cThat will be three million tests that don\u2019t need to be sourced elsewhere, so that alleviates some pressure.\u201d    Authorities handed out more than 400,000 free RATs to people at state testing sites last week. Deputy Chief Health Officer Ben Cowie said the additional RATs would allow people to begin their isolation periods sooner and ensure they were linked to care faster. \u201cIt is great news that the tide is starting to turn on the supply of rapid antigen tests in Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all going to have significantly increased access in the coming days and weeks.\u201d Meanwhile, Mr Andrews flagged the state government would soon make an announcement on what the return of schools would look like. \u201cWe will have another discussion this coming Thursday, and we look forward to making announcements quite soon,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of officials are working really hard on the return to school.\u201d There are a record 1114 patients in Victorian hospitals with COVID-19, 60 more than the 1054 on Saturday. The number of people in ICU has grown to 122, with 35 on ventilators, five more than the previous day. Professor Cowie said hospitalisations were increasing \u201csignificantly\u201d every day and health teams were working to build up capacity.

Lloyd says he has another hour of submissions to make, so the hearing should be concluded by mid-afternoon.        1.26am GMT       On the same issue (whether the government properly considered the impact of deporting Djokovic), Lloyd points to the unrest that occurred after the first decision to revoke the cancellation of Djokovic\u2019s visa. There were protests in Melbourne directly connected to the issue. The minister was clearly aware of those protests.  So the minister, he says, clearly would have considered that another decision cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa and deport him would create further unrest.   So it\u2019s impossible to imagine that wasn\u2019t within the minister\u2019s understanding.       Updated at 1.29am GMT     1.21am GMT       In the federal court, Justice Besanko intervened to ask whether it was sufficient that the immigration minister was aware of possible unrest if Djokovic were deported, or whether he had to take that into account in his decision. For the Australian government, Stephen Lloyd replied:   They have to show he failed to consider the issue. They say there is nothing in the decision about it, so you should infer he didn\u2019t do it. We say: he doesn\u2019t have to do a comprehensive set of reasons. There\u2019s no obligation of reasons, so you shouldn\u2019t start from the proposition that if not mentioned it wasn\u2019t done. A whole lot of other things are mentioned which suggests those matters were taken into account in the decision making process. [Alex Hawke] has in mind the broad possibility of unrest, whatever his decision. It becomes impossible to infer that wasn\u2019t part of the balance.        1.19am GMT    Queensland records 17,445 Covid cases and three deaths    And Queensland has just reported three deaths and 17,445 new Covid cases.

He says it is obvious from the material that he turned his mind to the possibility of unrest, whether Djokovic was present in Australia or deported.   We separately have an argument that [the minister] didn\u2019t need to consider it.         1.00am GMT       In the federal court, the chief justice James Allsop has just asked the minister to explain the government\u2019s position on the \u201ccounter-factual\u201d. Here, the counter-factual means the risks posed by deporting Djokovic, rather than allowing him to remain in Australia.  Interestingly, Allsop says:   One could see a situation in which it was plain to anyone with common sense that cancelling the visa would cause overwhelming public discord and risks of transmission through very large public gatherings. One could see in the sense the counter-factual overwhelming the mere focus only on ... the consequence of presence.   Djokovic\u2019s lawyers have accused the government of failing to consider the risks posed by deportation.  Stephen Lloyd, speaking for the minister, says the minister was \u201cobviously\u201d aware of the risks posed by the deportation of Djokovic, but believed that his presence would \u201cencourage others to emulate his position, and that would put Australians at risk\u201d.   The concern is that he\u2019s a high profile person who is in many respects a role model, certainly for many people, so that his presence in Australia would present more strongly and more currently to Australians his anti-vaccination views.   Lloyd also said \u201cthe starting point is that [the minister\u2019s power to cancel the visa] doesn\u2019t call for counterfactual at all\u201d and the decision deals with the \u201cpresence of the. person in Australia\u201d.  He said:  The idea of asking for a counterfactual raises the surprising notion that Australia when deciding whether or not to cancel a visa, might have to avoid cancelling a visa of someone who is actually presenting a risk when they are here, that Australia\u2019s sovereignty is held at risk because the cancellation might lead to adverse consequences.  Lloyd submitted the counterfactual wasn\u2019t a \u201cmandatory consideration\u201d - it was relevant, but the minister didn\u2019t have to take it into account.    Updated at 1.03am GMT     12.52am GMT       Just away from the Djokovic case for a moment, the health minister Greg Hunt has defended the government\u2019s approach to rapid antigen test procurement.  In October, when asked about the availability of rapid antigen tests, Hunt said that the government would \u201clet that market develop\u201d. Fast forward three months and the tests are in short supply, leading the Australian Medical Association to describe the situation as a \u201cmarket failure\u201d. The health minister said that around the world the Omicron variant had seen case numbers explode from 500,000 cases a day to more than 4 million cases a day, and supplies were a \u201cglobal challenge\u201d. But he said supplies of the 66 approved tests, including home and point of care kits, were now coming into Australia.  What you\u2019re seeing is increasing supply of rapid antigen tests, but right around the world vastly increased demand.  We\u2019ve been in the market since August, and we\u2019ve been able to provide that continuous supply to aged care. The states have recently entered the market and they\u2019ve indicated that there are significant purchases that they\u2019ve made, and we are beginning to see now already more supplies coming into the pharmacies and the supermarkets. So that\u2019s been a global challenge, but what I\u2019m pleased about is that the Australian market has responded.  Hunt said that the GP package to expand telehealth, announced Sunday morning, did not include the provision of rapid antigen tests because it was focused on personal protective equipment, but the government would allow rapid antigen test diagnoses to qualify for the Covid supplement payment to doctors. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners \u201ccautiously welcomed\u201d the GP package, which it said had been announced after its meetings with the minister.  RACGP President Dr Karen Price said:  It\u2019s positive news that the Government is listening to the Royal Australian College of GPs on telehealth and need for more support to manage the increasing number of COVID-19 positive patients in the community. GPs and patients have embraced telehealth during the pandemic, and it is here to stay. Video and telephone consultations have changed the way we deliver healthcare and I believe many patients will continue to utilise telehealth for years to come post-pandemic as a compliment to face-to-face care. We have strongly advocated for Medicare rebates to remain for longer telephone consultations and for good reason. Telehealth use in Australia is largely phone-based. Between March 2020 and March 2021, video consultations comprised only 2.4% of telehealth services. Video consultations are not suitable for many patients including older people unaccustomed to the technology or those with unreliable internet access.       Updated at 1.09am GMT     12.43am GMT       We\u2019re back to the BBC report, in which Djokovic expressed opposition to vaccines. That report was published well before the Covid vaccine was available. But Lloyd says that only strengthens the government\u2019s view that he was opposed to vaccinations:  Even before vaccinations were available, his prima facie position was to be against them. Sure, he left open the possibility that he might change his mind. But nevertheless his publicly stated position was that he was not in favour of taking vaccines.      Updated at 12.44am GMT     12.38am GMT       Lloyd says the minister is not just relying on Djokovic\u2019s public statements to assume an opposition to vaccination.  It\u2019s not just the applicant\u2019s public statements that he is opposed to vaccination, it is the fact of his ongoing non-vaccinated status ... at this stage of the pandemic. It is open to infer that a person in the applicant\u2019s position could have been vaccinated if he had wanted to be.  He continues:   We say that that choice makes an important inference about his views about Covid-19 vaccination.      Updated at 12.45am GMT     12.36am GMT       Barrister Stephen Lloyd is now making submissions on behalf of the immigration minister, Alex Hawke.  He quickly picks up on a point just made by Chief Justice Allsop, saying the minister is entitled to rely on his common sense when deciding whether to cancel a visa, not just material evidence later placed before a court.  Lloyd:  We certainly embrace the view that it is not limited to evidence before a court, administrative decision-makers usually inform themselves by a much broader range of materials.      Updated at 12.45am GMT     12.32am GMT    Djokovic's lawyers conclude submissions    Wood is now pointing out the \u201ccontradiction\u201d in the minister not asking Djokovic for his current views on vaccination, despite claiming he had a \u201cwell-known stance on vaccination\u201d. The minister, as we\u2019ve reported, relied on an old BBC report, published before the Covid vaccine was available, to suggest Djokovic was against vaccination. Wood says the reliance on that BBC report was done without context, including by reference to Djokovic\u2019s comments that he was no expert. And that\u2019s where Wood concludes his submissions.        12.29am GMT       The chief justice, James Allsop, has just intervened to make an observation that is very helpful for the immigration minister\u2019s case. Djokovic\u2019s lawyers have been focused on the lack of \u201cevidence\u201d before Alex Hawke of the impact of his presence in Australia. Allsop said:  The word evidence shouldn\u2019t mislead. What is really necessary is material before a decision-maker, which material includes the rational and reasonable use of perception and common-sense, in the place the decision-maker is in.   One needs to be careful when speaking about evidence in the sense of litigation... Before a decision-maker, it\u2019s the legitimacy of the material before [them] and whether or not it is of sufficient character including what can be drawn from common-sense and the perception of the minister to matters relevant in the community.\u201d  So, Allsop is saying the minister is entitled to rely on his common-sense. That\u2019s a big blow for Djokovic\u2019s case.  Djokovic\u2019s lawyers accepted that statement of the law.    Updated at 12.31am GMT     12.21am GMT       We\u2019re now on to ground two \u2013 attacking the minister\u2019s purported satisfaction that Mr Djokovic\u2019s presence \u201cmay\u201d cause a risk to public health or good order. Nicholas Wood submitted the minister needed to be positive satisfied, it must be formed \u201crationally upon findings of fact which are logically founded by probative evidence\u201d. Wood:  As I\u2019ve said, the only evidence here was the BBC report that concerned anti-vax sentiment following cancellation. If there were evidence about anti-vax sentiment consequent to Mr Djokovic merely being in a place and playing tennis, such evidence could have been obtained \u2013 Rr Djokovic has been playing tennis for a long time \u2013 but no such evidence was identified.  Wood also accused Alex Hawke of \u201celementary error\u201d by citing news reports about anti-vax protests that don\u2019t mention Djokovic.       12.09am GMT       Back in the federal court, Wood is savaging the government\u2019s claim that it did consider the effects deportation would have on anti-vaccination sentiment.  He says that Alex Hawke\u2019s case amounts to asking the court to \u201cinfer from snippets of this and that\u201d that there was \u201cactive consideration\u201d of the counterfactual (what the impact on anti-vax sentiment of booting Djokovic would be). Wood ridicules the government\u2019s claim that its consideration of a public poll, which voices only general support for Djokovic\u2019s presence in the country, amounted to it considering whether his deportation would excite anti-vaccination sentiment.   The minister\u2019s grasping for straws... it was not considered.

Local beaches have been closed.  Here\u2019s the SES statement:  As a result of an eruption of HUNGA TONGA-HUNGA HA\u2019APA in the Tongan Islands at 3.10pm AEDT Saturday 15 January 2022, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a marine tsunami warning for the NSW coastline, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. NSW State Emergency Service (NSW SES) is the lead agency for tsunami in NSW. To keep members of the community safe, local beaches along the state\u2019s coast have been closed. NSW SES is asking that members of the public stay out of the water until it is safe to do so. Members of the public considering looking to local rivers as an alternative for swimming are reminded that due to recent heavy rain, some river systems across the state are swollen, and may present dangerous swimming conditions. The marine tsunami warning for the NSW coast could have the following impacts: dangerous rips and waves, strong ocean currents and some localised overflow onto the immediate foreshore exists overall coastal areas. An initial land tsunami warning for low-lying coastal areas of Lord Howe Island has since been downgraded to a marine tsunami warning this morning (Sunday 16 January). Norfolk Island has also been downgraded to a marine tsunami warning. NSW SES is working closely with Surf Life Saving, NSW police and local councils to ensure members of the community are safe.       Updated at 12.42am GMT     12.01am GMT       Wood continues, describing the failure to consider the consequences of deportation as \u201cperverse\u201d.  It is somewhat perverse to adopt such a narrow focal point or lens on the 133(c)(a) question and to blinker oneself only to risks related to presence, when there is evidence before you of the risks related to the binary alternative.         11.57pm GMT    'Irrational' for minister not to consider anti-vax consequences of Djokovic deportation    Wood is developing the argument that the minister should have considered the consequences of deporting Djokovic on anti-vaccination sentiment.   It was irrational, your honours, for the minister to only contemplate the prospect of the fostering of anti-vaxx sentiment that might accrue from Mr Djokovic playing tennis, in other words being present, and yet not consider the binary alternative, which was the prospect of anti-vaxx sentiment being fostered by ... coercive state action.   Wood says \u201cno evidence at all\u201d was obtained about the impact on anti-vaccination sentiment posed by Djokovic remaining in Australia and playing tennis. He said such evidence was available, because Djokovic has been playing tennis all over the world since the vaccine was developed.  Wood says Djokovic only needs to prove that the immigration minister should have considered a \u201cmaterial possibility\u201d that deporting Djokovic would drive up anti-vaccination sentiment.   We don\u2019t need to demonstrate the anti-vaxx sentiment if cancelled would have been greater than Djokovic\u2019s mere presence in Australia, however I hasten to add that is the only evidence that existed. [We need prove] only that the minister if he had considered [it] \u2026 there is a material possibility that there is some such anti-vaxx sentiment because ultimately this is a balancing of scales exercise. All but one of the factors went in Mr Djokovic\u2019s favour \u2026 Plainly there is a material prospect that the public interest assessment might have differed because of balancing the scales, or the discretionary exercise would\u2019ve differed [if he had considered the counterfactual].     Updated at 12.05am GMT     11.50pm GMT       In the hearing, we\u2019re now talking about the immigration minister Alex Hawke\u2019s assertion that Djokovic is a \u201crisk to good order\u201d. This is a seperate ground used to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa, alongside the health concerns expressed by Hawke. Nicholas Wood, Djokovic\u2019s counsel, also challenges the notion that Djokovic\u2019s presence is a threat to \u201cgood order\u201d, saying it is also based on faulty logic.   The same thread of reasoning on health also runs through the minister\u2019s reasoning on good order.        11.45pm GMT       Djokovic\u2019s written submissions in reply have been published. Djokovic\u2019s lawyers have invited the court to draw the inference that Hawke didn\u2019t consider the counterfactual (anti-vaxx unrest if his visa were cancelled). They argue Alex Hawke\u2019s decision was \u201ccomprehensive\u201d, that the minister considered everything he set out in it and nothing else. They note Hawke\u2019s legal team has made an \u201cimportant concession that there is no express reference to the counterfactual in the reasons\u201d. They said:  The minster expressly confines his consideration of \u2018unrest\u2019 to things that have already happened. That is, he says that the fact that there has been some unrest which the minister associates with Mr Djokovic\u2019s presence in Australia is a factor against cancellation; this says absolutely nothing about the unrest that might follow from his absence, despite this perhaps being an obvious place to consider that very issue.  Again, Djokovic\u2019s lawyers say there is no evidence his presence will incite unrest. They said:  The minister is not permitted to cancel a visa based on an evidence-free figment of his imagination.     Updated at 11.49pm GMT     11.36pm GMT    Tsunami warnings downgraded    Just away from the federal court, momentarily, we\u2019ve got a little more detail on the tsunami alerts issued following the underwater volcano eruption overnight. The tsunami alerts for Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island have been downgraded.    #LordHoweIsland, #NorfolkIsland #Tsunami Warnings downgraded to Marine Threat. #NSW, #QLD, #TAS, #VIC, #MacquarieIsland #Tsunami Warnings unchanged at Marine Threat after volcanic eruption near the TONGA ISLANDS.

She says tsunami alerts have been downgraded in some areas.   And the latest news is the land threat off the islands of the coasts, the Pacific Islanders have been downgraded. They were a land threat, now they\u2019ve been downgraded to a marine threat. Those warnings will remain in place for a particular location until there are no significant observations for six hours, so we are waiting to be really sure that the impact on the energy for their volcanic eruptions have dispersed and it\u2019s no longer a danger to any people out of the water.     Updated at 11.45pm GMT     11.31pm GMT       Djokovic\u2019s counsel, Nicholas Wood, is arguing that \u201cthe only evidence\u201d connecting Djokovic to anti-vaccination demonstrations is a BBC article about anti-vaxx groups\u2019 anger \u201cin response to action by the state to cancel his visa\u201d. Wood said:  Not a single line of evidence in the material before the minister provided any specific, logical or probative foundation for the proposition that the mere presence of Djokovic himself \u2013 not the cancellation of his visa and expulsion \u2013 may somehow foster anti-vaccination sentiment.  Wood said it is conceivable that his presence could have that effect, but that is not enough.    Updated at 11.35pm GMT     11.29pm GMT    No evidence Djokovic's presence at other tournaments increased anti-vaxx sentiment: lawyers    Wood notes that Djokovic has been playing at tennis tournaments and grand slams ever since the Covid-19 vaccination was developed and distributed, including the last Australian Open. There is no evidence that his presence at any other tournament had excited anti-vaccination sentiment, he says, despite the fact there would be a \u201creservoir of evidence\u201d if it had, given his global profile.   There\u2019s nothing like that of any kind identified by the minister whatsoever.      Updated at 11.35pm GMT     11.23pm GMT       This is interesting. We\u2019re back on to the BBC report that the minister relied on to suggest Djokovic\u2019s presence in the country would excite anti-vaccination sentiment.  Wood says the BBC report was published after the government\u2019s first decision to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa. The report suggested it was the government\u2019s decision, rather than Djokovic himself, that had \u201cgalvanised anti-vaccination activists\u201d.  The only evidence is anti-vaxx group anger and agitation in response to action by the state to cancel him and thereby to set in train a course of events that would ... have led to his expulsion and statutory consequences impairing his capacity to come back to this country.\u201d     Updated at 11.28pm GMT     11.17pm GMT       The court hears minister Hawke cited two articles \u2013 one from the Guardian and another from the ABC \u2013 to suggest that anti-vaccination groups in Australia had expressed support for Djokovic due to his vaccination status.  But Wood says neither article made any mention of Djokovic whatsoever. The articles were about anti-vaccination groups but said nothing of the tennis star, he said.  He says it is clearly an error by the minister.  That is plainly wrong. Mr Djokovic is not referred to once in either of the articles from the Guardian or ABC news.      Updated at 11.20pm GMT     11.13pm GMT    Minister failed to seek clarification on Djokovic's current vaccination views, court hears    Wood is speaking about the minister\u2019s finding that Djokovic was a \u201chigh-profile unvaccinated individual\u201d who had indicated publicly that he was opposed to becoming vaccinated.  He raises a BBC article cited by the minister as evidence of Djokovic\u2019s approach to vaccination. The article says Djokovic was opposed to being forced to be vaccinated to travel.  But Wood says the BBC article also quoted Djokovic as saying he was \u201cno expert\u201d, wanted to \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d and \u201cwanted to choose an option that is best for my body\u201d. Wood says minister Alex Hawke ignored that part of the article in his reasons. The court hears that Hawke also sought no new clarification from Djokovic about his current attitudes towards vaccination. Wood says Djokovic\u2019s previous statements about vaccination were from before the Covid-19 vaccination was developed.       Updated at 11.19pm GMT     11.05pm GMT       Djokovic\u2019s counsel, Nicholas Wood, is making submissions. The early submissions are complex and relate to the legal authorities the government is relying on as foundations for its decision to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa. The minister\u2019s statement of reasons for the decision, issued voluntarily to explain his reasoning, completely ignored the first argument the government used to cancel his visa, namely that he had no proper medical exemption to bypass the border restrictions.  Instead, Wood argues, the government \u201cerected an entirely different rationale\u201d. That rationale was that Djokovic would excite anti-vaccination sentiment in Australia.  Wood says the minister had \u201cnot sought or read the actual medical material that Mr Djokovic had provided\u201d to the government after the initial challenge to his visa. That included material that Djokovic posed no real health threat given his recent Covid infection.     Updated at 11.16pm GMT     10.42pm GMT       The hearing has started with an explanation from Chief Justice James Allsop about why he considered the case significant enough to have a full court (three judges) hear the case to finalise it today or tomorrow. Allsop says that they needed to go to a higher level right away, because the right of appeal by Djokovic from a single judge to three judges would\u2019ve been \u201cinutile\u201d because of the looming Australian Open. Basically \u2013 we need a result, pronto.        10.38pm GMT       In submissions just released the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has argued that:  It was \u201cclearly open\u201d to him to conclude that Djokovic is personally opposed to vaccination. There is \u201cample evidence\u201d that Djokovic\u2019s presence may foster anti-vaccination sentiment. Djokovic has failed to show that the minister didn\u2019t consider the impact of cancellation on anti-vaxx sentiment.  Hawke\u2019s submissions note the \u201ccounter-argument\u201d that he didn\u2019t consider the impact of Djokovic\u2019s removal and says basically ... prove it. \u201cThere is insufficient basis for the court to make this finding,\u201d he said. Even if Hawke didn\u2019t consider this, the minister argued that didn\u2019t make his decision illogical, irrational or unreasonable, and it was not a material error. Hawke has responded to Djokovic\u2019s argument he should have ASKED his view by asking:   What Mr Djokovic could have said to the minister in response to a question about his stance on vaccination would not have altered the fact of his previous public statements and the views of those in the Australian community as to what his views on vaccination were.     Updated at 10.49pm GMT     10.32pm GMT    Djokovic case begins    Proceedings have just begun in the federal court, before Chief Justice James Allsop, Justice Anthony Besanko and Justice David O\u2019Callaghan.       10.27pm GMT       Novak Djokovic\u2019s amended submissions are now public, arguing that immigration minister Alex Hawke:  Failed to consider the consequences of cancellation Could not be satisfied that Djokovic\u2019s presence \u201cis or may be\u201d a risk; and Was unreasonable in his conclusion about Djokovic\u2019s stance on vaccination.  Djokovic\u2019s lawyers have argued that what really galvanised anti-vaccination sentiment was the first decision to cancel Djokovic\u2019s visa, citing a BBC report about widespread backlash in the wake of that decision, which was later overturned by the federal circuit court. They said:   It was irrational, illogical or unreasonable for the minister to fail to consider the influence of Mr Djokovic\u2019s removal on anti-vaccination sentiment.  Djokovic\u2019s lawyers also dispute claims Djokovic is an anti-vaxxer, arguing this was based on one statement in March 2020 that had since been qualified. They said:  There was no evidence before the minister that Mr Djokovic has ever urged any others not to be vaccinated. Indeed, if anything, Mr Djokovic\u2019s conduct over time reveals a zealous protection of his own privacy rather than any advocacy.  They criticise Hawke for not making \u201cthe obvious, critical, and easy inquiry of Djokovic as to what his sentiment in fact was\u201d.    Updated at 10.31pm GMT     10.24pm GMT    Additional funding to broaden telehealth    In further Australian Covid news, the Morrison government has announced $24m in new funding to widen the use of telehealth for GPs and other specialists. The funding is a direct reaction to the infection rate from the Omicron outbreak. AAP reports:   The $24m will also cover the continued supply of personal protective equipment, such as masks, respirators, face shields and gowns for face-to-face consultations including patients that have tested positive through a rapid antigen test. The latter aligns with national cabinet\u2019s January 5 decision that RAT tests no longer need to be confirmed by a PCR test. Health minister Greg Hunt said telehealth had been a vital support during the pandemic, providing greater flexibility in healthcare delivery at the most critical time and continues to be a fundamental part of the pandemic response. The government will introduce temporary specialist inpatient telehealth \u2013 via video and phone \u2013 including initial and complex specialist telephone consultation items, and longer telephone consultations for GPs until June 30, 2022. \u201cThese services will be made available nationally rather than targeted to Commonwealth-declared hotspots as they were previously, recognising the high infection rate and need to provide healthcare support across the community,\u201d Hunt said in a joint statement with regional health minister David Gillespie.     Updated at 10.27pm GMT     10.14pm GMT    NSW records 20 deaths and 34,660 new Covid cases    NSW has just released its latest Covid data. It recorded 20 deaths in the previous 24 hours and 34,660 new cases.     NSW COVID-19 update \u2013 Sunday 16 January 2022 In the 24-hour reporting period to 8pm last night:- 95.2% of people aged 16+ have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine- 93.8% of people aged 16+ have had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine pic.twitter.com/si9U4l6rpR&mdash; NSW Health (@NSWHealth) January 15, 2022      Updated at 10.20pm GMT     10.09pm GMT       Our reporter Paul Karp will be covering the Djokovic hearing today. He\u2019s just sent this preview:  The full federal court will sit today (commencing 9:30am AEDT) to hear Novak Djokovic\u2019s bid to overturn the immigration minister, Alex Hawke\u2019s, decision to cancel his visa. According to court documents, Hawke\u2019s decision was based on his satisfaction that Djokovic could pose a risk to \u201ccivil unrest\u201d as he is a \u201ctalisman of anti-vaccination sentiment\u201d. Djokovic\u2019s lawyers will argue that: this conclusion was illogical, irrational or unreasonable; it was not open for Hawke to find Djokovic is a risk to health or good order; and that Hawke made findings about Djokovic\u2019s views on vaccination based on public statements without actually seeking his views. Overnight, Djokovic\u2019s lawyers lodged an amended document at 9:15pm \u2013 so it\u2019s possible he has added to his case. Hawke\u2019s submissions were lodged at 10pm. The hearing will be before three judges: Chief Justice James Allsop, Justice Anthony Besanko and Justice David O\u2019Callaghan. The significance of that is that, win or lose, the result is likely to be final. Only the high court sits above the full federal court, and taking the case there that would require leave to appeal.

So far, we have no reports of injuries or on the extent of the damage because all internet connectivity with Tonga was lost at about 6.40pm local time. Tsunami advisories were issued for other Pacific islands, the Australian east coast, Hawaii, Alaska and the US Pacific coast.

Satellite images showed a huge eruption, with a plume of ash, steam and gas rising like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters. Authorities in the nearby island nations of Fiji and Samoa also issued warnings, telling people to avoid the shoreline due to strong currents and dangerous waves. In New Zealand, officials warned of possible storm surges from the eruption. New Zealand\u2019s private forecaster, Weather Watch, tweeted that people as far away as Southland, the country\u2019s southernmost region, reported hearing sonic booms from the eruption. Others reported that many boats were damaged by a tsunami that hit a marina in Whangarei, in the Northland region. Earlier, the Matangi Tonga news site reported that scientists observed massive explosions, thunder and lightning near the volcano after it started erupting early on Friday. Satellite images showed a 5km-wide plume rising into the air to about 20km. The Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcano is about 64km north of the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. In late 2014 and early 2015, a series of eruptions in the area created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days. The Tonga Meteorological Services said a tsunami warning was declared for all of the archipelago, and data from the Pacific tsunami centre said waves of 80cm (2.7ft) were detected.     We are continuing to monitor the #tsunami event after a volcanic eruption near #Tonga.

Early Sunday morning, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age published the results of poll showing more than two-thirds of Australians believe Novak Djokovic should be sent home without playing in the Australian Open.  The survey showed 71% of respondents believed he should not be allowed to stay, only 14% want him to compete, and 15 % say they do not care if he stays or goes.         9.50pm GMT    Djokovic leaves immigration hotel    Novak Djokovic has left the Park Hotel and is on his way to his lawyers\u2019 offices in Melbourne.       Support for Djokovic has been strongest in Serbia, including in the capital Belgrade, where Serbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 has posted a video statement attacking the Australian government overnight. Vu\u010di\u0107 accused Australian prime minister Scott Morrison of mistreating Djokovic for political purposes.   If you wanted to forbid Novak Djokovic to win the trophy for the 10th time, why didn\u2019t you return him immediately? Why didn\u2019t you tell him that it was impossible to get a visa. Why do you harass him? Why do you mistreat him, as well as his family and nation that is free and proud? Is all this necessary to win the elections and please your public?  Djokovic was also the holder of a diplomatic passport, according to the Serbian government. In a statement reported by the Sydney Morning Herald, the embassy said that should have entitled him to fair treatment at the border.   Although the fact is that he is the best tennis player in the world, Serbia doesn\u2019t expect any preferential treatment of Novak Djokovic, but an adequate, professional approach of foreign authorities, which we are obliged to provide to every holder of our travel document.  On the other hand, we do not expect that, because of his status as the best, he will be subjected to a particularly harsh treatment in order to serve as an example to others just because of his popularity.     Updated at 10.21pm GMT     9.41pm GMT       The Australian Open is due to begin tomorrow. It\u2019s not actually clear whether we\u2019ll have a decision from the federal court before then, though it\u2019s certainly open for the judges to hand down judgment immediately.  The Djokovic saga has understandably overshadowed the event\u2019s preparations.  Many of the competitors are frustrated by that fact. Only a few have spoken candidly about the Djokovic case, but fewer still have openly offered support for his actions. The Australian Alex de Minaur, the world No 42, hinted at the resentment many people feel in Melbourne, a city which has endured lengthy lockdowns throughout the pandemic.   Australians have gone through a lot. There\u2019s no secret about that. They\u2019ve had it very tough. They\u2019ve done a lot of work to protect themselves and their borders. When you\u2019re coming in, as well as every other tennis player, if you wanted to come into the country, you had to be double vaccinated. It was up to him, his choices, his judgment.  Nick Kyrgios, previously critical of Djokovic\u2019s response to Covid, has offered some support for the world No 1. Kyrgios told the No Boundaries Podcast:   It\u2019s just a shitshow. It\u2019s not even about the vaccination any more. I feel so sorry for him. How we\u2019re dealing with stuff is just so embarrassing. I just think if Australia had dealt with Covid better, I don\u2019t think this would be such a big issue. It\u2019s insane now.  Rafael Nadal, who will be among the favourites whether or not Djokovic plays, said:  From my point of view, there is a lot of questions that need to be answered. In some ways I think it will be good if everything is clarified soon. Everyone chooses his road. I wish him all the best. I really respect him, even if I do not agree with a lot of things that he did the last couple of weeks.    Related: Djokovic\u2019s vaccine stance leaves him short of support from fellow players | Simon Cambers      Updated at 9.46pm GMT     9.34pm GMT       We\u2019ve still got an hour until proceedings begin in the federal court, where the case will be heard by a full bench, comprisong Chief Justice James Allsop, Justice Anthony Besanko and Justice David O\u2019Callaghan. Novak Djokovic spent last night back at Melbourne\u2019s Park Hotel, used as an immigration detention facility, after he was returned into the custody of Border Force guards on Saturday. His detention again prompted supporters and anti-vaccination groups to gather outside the hotel late Saturday.  So what exactly is Australia\u2019s case against the world\u2019s best tennis player? Well, it\u2019s shifted entirely from its first, failed iteration. The immigration minister Alex Hawke initially argued Djokovic had arrived in Australia without a proper exemption to the country\u2019s tough Covid-19 border restrictions, which require full vaccination.  Hawke, after losing his first case, has now conceded Djokovic arrived with a proper exemption. He now argues that Djokovic\u2019s pubic opposition to vaccination, disregard for Covid-19 restrictions and global popularity may fuel the anti-vaccination movement in Australia, posing a threat of civil unrest.  Hawke:   Given Mr Djokovic\u2019s high-profile status and position as a role model in the sporting and broader community, his ongoing presence in Australia may foster similar disregard for the precautionary requirements following receipt of a positive Covid-19 test in Australia.  In particular, his behaviour may encourage or influence others to emulate his prior conduct and fail to comply with appropriate health measures following a positive Covid-19 test, which itself could lead to the transmission of the disease and serious risk to their health and others. I consider that Mr Djokovic\u2019s ongoing presence in Australia may lead to an increase in anti-vaccination sentiment generated in the Australian community, potentially leading to an increase in civil unrest of the kind previously experienced in Australia with rallies and protests which may themselves be a source of community transmission.       Updated at 9.37pm GMT     9.20pm GMT       Hello everyone and welcome.  It\u2019s a huge news day today. All eyes will, of course, be on Novak Djokovic.  From 9.30am, Melbourne time, the federal court will hear his fight to overturn his visa cancellation. If he\u2019s successful, he\u2019ll be allowed to stay in Australia and defend his Australian Open title, pending any appeal. If he fails, Djokovic will be deported and barred from the country for three years.  The hearing will directly engage with Djokovic\u2019s views on vaccination. Australia\u2019s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, argues the unvaccinated star\u2019s presence in Australia could incite \u201ccivil unrest\u201d and encourage others to avoid vaccination against Covid-19. Djokovic, in the government\u2019s view, is \u201cperceived by some as a talisman of a community of anti-vaccine sentiment\u201d and cannot be allowed to stay in the country.  Djokovic\u2019s lawyers say there is no evidence whatsoever to bolster the minister\u2019s claims, and that the characterisation that Djokovic held anti-vaccination views was unjustified, based on selectively edited historical comments in the media. It promises to be a dramatic day before the federal court\u2019s full bench. We\u2019ll bring you all the developments as they happen. Djokovic\u2019s case is not the only issue making news this morning. We\u2019ll continue to bring you the latest Australian Covid news and developments in Tonga, where the eruption of an underwater volcano has prompted tsunami fears this morning.       Updated at 9.24pm GMT  ", "Coalition party room backs religious bill changes; at least 55 Covid deaths recorded \u2013 as it happened [2022-02-08T08:48:32Z]": "  8.40am GMT    What happened on Tuesday 8 February, 2022    With that, we will wrap up our live news coverage of the day.  These were the day\u2019s news developments:   The Morrison government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination bill dominated discussion on the first federal parliamentary sitting day of the year. Scott Morrison corralled the Coalition party room to support amendments that only partially protect gay students, despite at least six Liberal MPs expressing concern about the religious discrimination bill. Late on Tuesday, Liberal MP Bridget Archer announced she would not support the bill because she is concerned it could result in self harm or even suicide. Earlier on Tuesday, the prime minister issued a formal apology to people who have experience sexual harassment, assault or bullying while working at parliament. Morrison directly apologised to former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, who was in the public gallery for the statement. Nurses and other workers in aged care descended on Parliament House on Tuesday morning protesting dangerous staff shortages, underpayment, and a lack of personal protective equipment \u2013 issues that persist more than two years after the Covid-19 pandemic began and despite numerous inquiries into the aged care sector. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has welcomed plans to reopen Australia\u2019s border on 21 February but warned travellers may need a third Covid-19 vaccine dose in order to move freely about the state. Australian consular officials have been denied access to a dual Australian-Chinese citizen detained in Hong Kong for 11 months for alleged \u201csubversion\u201d.  Thanks for following along, we\u2019ll be back to do it all again tomorrow.    Updated at 8.48am GMT     8.27am GMT       Labor MP Stephen Jones has just shared a tragic personal story about his nephew taking his own life in debate about the religious discrimination bill. Jones said:  Last week my family said farewell to my nephew Ollie. He was just 15 when he took his own life. No mother or father should have to endure this sight, no brother should have to clean up afterwards. He was a beautiful, creative, courageous young man. He was loved and accepted by his parents, family by his friends and community. His mum and dad are in anguish \u2013 we all are. He was gay, uncertain about his gender and struggled with his mental health. Now, he\u2019s gone and we\u2019re no longer going to be able to love and support him in his journey through life. Love and acceptance of family and friends weren\u2019t enough.\u201d  Jones also shared his son\u2019s gender non-conforming behaviour including a love for women\u2019s clothing, and his fears his son will be attacked for doing so. Jones said the love of a family is not enough, because at some point they step out into the world, so parliamentarians must think about how they shape the world.Jones said:  What message do we want parliament to send to these kids? Are they as loved and respected as other kids... Surely we can do better than to say it\u2019s OK if you\u2019re gay as long as you don\u2019t show it.\u201d     Updated at 8.38am GMT     8.15am GMT       Liberal MP Dave Sharma has told the lower house he supports prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of religion, but has concerns with the bill. Sharma took aim at Citipointe Christian College. He said:  We should not allow people to be vilified on the basis of attributes of which they have no choice, that are intrinsic to who people are.\u201d  Sharma said that human rights are \u201cequal and indivisible\u201d and argued the government should amend the Sex Discrimination Act to protect both students and teachers, on grounds of both sexual orientation and gender.  \u201cIt\u2019s time we cracked on and did it,\u201dhe said, without confirming whether he would move an amendment to do so, nor how he intended to vote on the bill. Sharma said the statements of belief clause \u201ccauses me to ask a number of questions\u201d and he is \u201cstill reconciling himself to it\u201d. He said:  All speech should deserve protection, it shouldn\u2019t matter if it is grounded in faith or not. Political speech should enjoy the same protection, artistic speech, ideological speech. It concerns me we have a provision that privilege a certain kind of speech that others lack. As a federalist, [concerned with the] rights of states, I\u2019m also a little uncomfortable overriding state laws ... That\u2019s for the Tasmanian government to fix.\u201d  So - major concerns - position still unclear.       7.52am GMT       Despite Scott Morrison asking MPs to make clear if they intended to reserve their position on the religious discrimination bill, a group of moderate Liberal MPs insist they are still negotiating with the attorney-general, and are signalling further possible changes. Dave Sharma told Network 10\u2019s The Project:  I will make my position clear when it comes time to vote on the bill. There are discussions internally and with my colleagues as well. I will continue to make sure I fight for communities, communities of faith but also the LGBTQI and the gay community to make sure their rights are protected in this.\u201d  Asked about why the government would allow discriminatory treatment of gay and trans youth, Sharma said:  I don\u2019t agree with that proposition and I don\u2019t think it would meet community expectations. I think the vast majority of Australians would agree that children and teachers shouldn\u2019t be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d     Updated at 7.58am GMT     7.49am GMT       Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite told the Parliament that he supported the general concept of protections against religious discrimination, but focused his speech mostly on section 12 of the legislation - which goes to the contentious \u201cstatements of belief\u201d. The proposed bill would make it so that voicing a genuinely-held religious belief \u201cdoes not constitute discrimination\u201d, as long as the statement isn\u2019t \u201cmalicious\u201d or would \u201cthreaten, intimidate, harass or vilify a person or group\u201d. Thistlethwaite voiced five concerns on that section, including claiming it would take Australia \u201cin the wrong direction about workplace culture and creating respectful and inclusive workplaces\u201d. He also claimed it would create \u201ca convoluted system of anti-discrimination law\u201d and \u201cpromotes divisive religion\u201d. Thistlethwaite, who spoke of his lifelong Catholic faith, said \u201cthis bill raises serious concerns because it\u2019s been rushed.\u201d Straight after, Coalition MP George Christensen rose to speak, calling the bill \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cwatered-down\u201d - and, in stark contrast to Thistlethwaite, he said the statement of belief protection doesn\u2019t go far enough. Christensen, who briefly considered becoming a priest, said he supports the bill because it will do \u201ca little bit of good, but it won\u2019t do much\u201d. Christensen claimed Christians had been \u201cdrowned out\u201d, complaining about \u201crampant secularism\u201d. He said he wanted to see more protections for religious people who wanted to voice their own beliefs, citing reports of workers who\u2019d lost their jobs after making religious comments.  Christensen said:  This is something I\u2019m very sad has been watered down this much... it is the hill we should die on, This is the problem, this bill is religious discrimination. What we wanted was religious liberty.\u201d        7.45am GMT       Nurses and other workers in aged care descended on Parliament House on Tuesday morning protesting dangerous staff shortages, underpayment and a lack of personal protective equipment \u2013 issues that persist more than two years after the Covid-19 pandemic began and despite numerous inquiries into the aged care sector. Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation federal secretary, Annie Butler, addressed protesters and said nurses are \u201cfed up with this government for abandoning aged care workers and residents\u201d. She said:  Our aged care workers and nurses are holding the system together as best they can but they have got virtually nothing left. This is a crisis that should never have been allowed to happen and we are saying directly, Mr [Scott] Morrison, you let this happen.  She said the government had allowed a breakdown of privately run nursing homes, having failed to implement recommendations from last year\u2019s aged care royal commission and numerous aged care inquiries that preceded it.  The government\u2019s own royal commission reports \u2013 that I can barely lift because of their depth \u2013 are all ignored ...  It\u2019s always too little too late.

Archer said:  I\u2019m horrified [the amendment] doesn\u2019t extend to students that identify as transgender. More than horrified, I\u2019m utterly distressed by this exclusion, and I can\u2019t begin to think how kids and parents feel. After so much progress, how did we get back to a place where we ignore the harm we place on children when we tell them they are \u2018other\u2019, \u2018less than\u2019 and do not deserve the rights and protections afforded to others? I fear it may risk lives.     Updated at 7.40am GMT     7.27am GMT    Bridget Archer to withhold support for religious discrimination bill    The MP for the seat of Bass, Bridget Archer, will not support the religious discrimination bill, telling parliament that she is concerned it could result in self harm or even suicide. She said:  The simple fact is this bill would allow for discrimination to happen. And while I support the desire to employ religious school leaders or teachers who share that religious ethos, I don\u2019t think that anybody would want to do so if it might cause harm to others. I\u2019m deeply concerned about the potential far reaching and unintended consequences of this bill.  She said that while she believed that nobody should be discriminated against because of their religion, the bill \u201cgoes further and beyond protecting somebody of faith\u201d.  As an elected representative, my job\u2019s to come here and vote on legislation that I believe will best serve my community.  This bill is an overreach and I cannot use the role that I have here to endorse a bill that erodes the rights of so many in my community ... and may cause them harm.  If the government wants to come back with a bill that protects people from religious discrimination without these other consequences then I would be supportive, but in its current form I cannot support this bill.     Updated at 7.31am GMT     7.14am GMT       Australian consular officials have been denied access to a dual Australian-Chinese citizen detained in Hong Kong for 11 months for alleged \u201csubversion\u201d. The Australian government \u2013 which has had an increasingly strained relationship with Beijing \u2013 renewed its concerns about \u201cthe erosion of basic freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong\u201d under the territory\u2019s broadly worded national security law. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has disclosed new details about the case of a dual Australian-Chinese citizen detained in Hong Kong under that law, after officials had previously said the person was \u201csubsequently released\u201d. The man, born in Hong Kong, was first arrested on 6 January 2021 \u201cfor conspiring to subvert state power\u201d and was released on bail the following day, Dfat said in a written response to a parliamentary question.  On 28 February 2021 Hong Kong police advised the individual that he was to be charged for \u2018subversion\u2019 and was required to attend West Kowloon magistrates\u2019 court on 1 March 2021, where he was again placed under arrest. The individual remains in detention.\u201d  Read more:   Related: Australia denied access to dual citizen detained for alleged \u2018subversion\u2019 in Hong Kong         6.55am GMT       Australia\u2019s mean temperature last year was 0.56C warmer than the long-term average despite 2021 being the country\u2019s coolest year in a decade. It was a year of contrasting weather and climate conditions, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its annual climate statement, with long-running heatwaves in northern Australia and widespread flooding in eastern states, in part due to a La Ni\u00f1a event. In the west, severe tropical cyclone Seroja was the southernmost tropical cyclone to make landfall since the 1950s. Averaged across the continent, last year was Australia\u2019s 19th warmest year on record. Mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures were above average for most of northern Australia, Tasmania, and parts of the west coast, but temperatures were cooler than average for parts of inland New South Wales and central Australia. \u201cAlthough 2021 was Australia\u2019s coolest year since 2012, temperatures were still much warmer than the historical average,\u201d said climatologist Jonathan Pollock. \u201cIn fact, of all the years on record prior to the year 2000, only five were warmer than 2021.\u201d Read more:   Related: Australia\u2019s coolest year in a decade still warmer than average, Bureau of Meteorology reports      Updated at 6.57am GMT     6.37am GMT       As the government seems set to leave trans students vulnerable to expulsion from religious schools in its amendments to the religious discrimination bill, it is worth noting that a government senator has made a submission to an inquiry into social media and online safety, in which she rails against the abuse copped online by those who argue for \u201csex-based rights\u201d.She singles out the focus on British millionaire author, JK Rowling, who has been subject to criticism after tweets about gender-neutral language erasing the experience of women and the \u201creality of biological sex\u201d.Liberal senator Claire Chandler has previously called for discrimination laws to be amended to allow trans people to be excluded from female-only sports, and her submission focused on a search for the Harry Potter author\u2019s name on Twitter for some of the threats Rowling receives.Despite acknowledging Rowling is from the UK and not Australia, she said it is what she and other \u201csex-based rights\u201d advocates receive for voicing their opinions online. She said:  The committee could take the view that the threats directed to Rowling are not a matter for this Committee because Rowling is not Australian. Committee members will no doubt also be invited by segments of the political left to find that the abuse of Rowling is justified because Rowling tweets statements which they don\u2019t like, such as pointing out the absurdity of a male rapist being classified by police as a woman. It would be a major error for the committee to take either of these views. The reach of social media and the internet is global, and so the treatment of Rowling online and on social media sets the standard for how Australian women advocating for women\u2019s sex-based rights can expect to be treated.  Chandler said she had also received abusive anonymous emails entitled \u201cTERFs [trans-exclusionary radical feminists] eat shit and die\u201d.Chandler doesn\u2019t insist on any sort of crackdown on social media or new watchdogs, but says there should be more \u201chigh-quality free debate and expression\u201d where \u201ctrolls and death threats are not part of the landscape\u201d, including debate in media, universities and parliament.This is where at least some within the government are at.     Updated at 6.40am GMT     6.21am GMT       Police have confirmed they are investigating several Coalition MPs seen not wearing masks inside Victoria\u2019s parliament. In a statement, Victoria police said:  Victoria Police is currently assessing images circulating on social media of MP\u2019s without a mask on in parliament on 8 February. As the incident is being reviewed by investigators, we will not be providing further comment at this stage.   The MPs, including opposition leader Matthew Guy, were photographed not wearing masks while posing with Essendon legend Kevin Sheedy, who gave a motivational speech to the Liberal party room ahead of the 2022 state election.     Deputy premier James Merlino says school kids more mature about wearing masks than opposition MPs.

Masks remain compulsory in Victoria in all indoor settings.     Updated at 7.00am GMT     6.04am GMT    Coalition party room endorses limited religious bill changes    Scott Morrison has corralled the Coalition party room to support amendments that only partially protect gay students, despite at least six Liberal MPs expressing concern about the religious discrimination bill. On Tuesday the Morrison government confirmed it proposes to protect gay students from expulsion \u2013 but not other forms of discrimination \u2013 without protecting trans students at the same time. The Coalition party room endorsed limited changes to the religious bill and Sex Discrimination Act in an extended meeting after question time. Guardian Australia understands that MPs who raised concerns with the bill or asked for further changes included Trent Zimmerman, Warren Entsch, Fiona Martin, Andrew Bragg, Julian Simmonds and Katie Allen. MPs Bridget Archer and Andrew Laming have also done so publicly, while Dave Sharma\u2019s position is unclear as he didn\u2019t speak in the meeting. Zimmerman expressly reserved his right NOT to vote for the bill but one account of the meeting said the others did not - we have contacted them to clarify if this means they will support the bill, although Archer has said publicly she cannot vote for the bill in its current form, so many think the government is already on notice. Speaking in favour of the bill were: Kevin Andrews, Eric Abetz, Julian Leeser and Matt Sullivan.    Updated at 6.10am GMT     5.47am GMT       Nationals senator Perrin Davey has played down the significance of the saga surrounding a text message in which the Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, called the prime minister, Scott Morrison, a hypocrite and a liar.  Appearing on ABC TV, Davey said Joyce had apologised to the prime minister and to the party room:  We move on, because we are actually focused on governing. Text messages, when I was out on the streets in my home community on the weekend, the only people who mention that story to me were saying what is this all about? Text messages? We don\u2019t care, we want to know what your plan is for the future. Are you going to be the better government when I come to the ballot box in May? My answer is yes we will. We are focused on jobs.     Updated at 5.52am GMT     5.33am GMT       From my colleagues Michael McGowan and Tamsin Rose on the New South Wales reporting team: A controversial $252m NSW government grant program \u201clacked integrity\u201d and did not use any consistent guidelines in awarding more than 95% of the money to local councils in Coalition state seats. A scathing report on the scandal-plagued Stronger Communities Fund, released by NSW auditor general, Margaret Crawford, on Tuesday revealed former premier Gladys Berejiklian and former deputy premier John Barilaro personally chose projects for the fund with \u201clittle or no information about the basis\u201d for their selections. The auditor\u2019s findings also confirmed the government had never published program guidelines and instead favoured local councils that had \u201cworked constructively\u201d with them in the past over council mergers. On the same day that Crawford\u2019s report was released, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that more than 75% of a separate $100m gambling revenue grant program was given to Coalition-held and battleground seats over a decade. Responding to the Stronger Communities Fund grants made in 2019, in the lead-up to the state election, the auditor general found a lack of formal systems in place \u201cprevent(ed) accountability and transparency over the government\u2019s approach to selecting councils for funding\u201d.

At this point I am going to hand you over to Elias Visontay, whose brain is likely to be much clearer. See you all tomorrow!        5.18am GMT       The Coalition party room has reconvened to resume consideration of the religious discrimination bill. Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has made a contribution \u2013 echoing concerns he made in additional comments to the Senate inquiry that the bill \u201cdeparts from orthodox anti-discrimination law by including a \u2018statement of belief\u2019 [clause]\u201d. In that report, Bragg noted problems with the clause including that: it gives preference to religion over other attributes; employers are concerned it licenses discrimination in the workplace; it overrides state laws; and \u201cthe question of costs\u201d, as no cost claims in state tribunals could be forced into federal courts by people raising a defence that allegedly discriminatory statements were statements of belief. Bragg recommended the statement of belief clause be removed in its entirety and the Sex Discrimination Act should be amended to \u201cend discrimination against students and teachers\u201d, noting the \u201cdeeply upsetting case studies\u201d of teachers who were sacked for their sexuality. Liberal MP Julian Leeser has spoken in favour of the bill. The tone is respectful and the result is likely to be agreement to make limited changes that prevent gay students from expulsion, but do not address the concerns of half a dozen MPs who called for broader protections or changes (Bridget Archer, Trent Zimmerman, Warren Entsch, Fiona Martin, Katie Allen, and Andrew Laming). Dave Sharma is yet to speak.    Updated at 5.21am GMT     5.15am GMT       The delegation of protesters has now left Craig Kelly\u2019s office. The group didn\u2019t get a chance to meet Scott Morrison or Anthony Albanese, as they had hoped to, but claimed to have left a copy of their letter of demands. The list included asking federal politicians to drop all vaccine mandates (note: very few mandates are federal responsibility, most are from state governments) and to pass Kelly\u2019s \u2018No Vaccine Passport Bill\u2019, which neither major party supports. The protesters also demanded politicians \u201creinstate and compensate\u201d people who\u2019d lost their jobs over refusing to get a vaccine. Demonstrators have another large protest planned at Parliament House on Saturday, claiming they want \u201cone million Aussies\u201d to arrive. The protests currently number a few thousand people.  Protest leader Graham Hood, who was part of the group visiting Kelly, flagged further big protests at Parliament during budget week in March. Hood also recommended supporters go home and \u201cregroup\u201d after this weekend. Canberra residents, who\u2019ve been annoyed by constant road closures and traffic through the protests, will likely celebrate that news.    Updated at 5.18am GMT     4.53am GMT       About 100 workers at the printing plant of West Australian Newspapers, which publishes the West Australian, have again been locked out of work as part of a long-running stoush with management, unions say. Management at WAN, which is part of the Kerry Stokes-controlled Seven West Media, previously locked the print workers, who are members of the AMWU, ETU and CFMEU, out of the plant in December. The long-running industrial barney is over an enterprise agreement to replace the one in force covering printers, which expired two years ago (EAs continue to operate past their expiry date until either replaced or cancelled.) Unions say the deal proposed by WAN would reduce conditions and take-home pay. WAN has previously said it wants a new deal that provides \u201csustainable employment conditions\u201d. Seven West Media has been contacted for comment.    Updated at 5.04am GMT     4.46am GMT       Some more from Mike Bowers, from the first question time for the year:         Updated at 5.01am GMT     4.38am GMT    WA records 65 new Covid cases    Western Australia has reported 65 new Covid cases \u2013 13 local and 52 travel related. Some of the new local cases were infectious in the community, and contact tracers are working to identify potential exposure sites.  All new cases are now in quarantine, WA Health says.     Updated at 4.42am GMT     4.25am GMT    Question time ends    After much argy-bargy, many divisions, ringing of the bells and locking of the doors, and emotions and motions, time has run out in 2022\u2019s first question time.  It got messy, stayed messy, and ended in a bit of a mess. And we\u2019re going to do it all again tomorrow!  Epilogue: Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen has withdrawn an unparliamentary remark (no, I don\u2019t know what it was).     Updated at 4.45am GMT     4.09am GMT       I\u2019m going to break this up with a peek down the lens of Guardian Australia photographer, Mike Bowers.         Updated at 4.52am GMT     4.05am GMT       Albanese is now moving to suspend standing orders to bring on a debate about the following:   That the house notes firstly in the third year of the pandemic, aged care remains in crisis, with almost 12,000 aged care residents and workers infected with Covid in more than 1100 facilities as of Friday, and over 600 deaths among aged care residents this year.  Secondly, tens of thousands of aged care residents are still waiting for a booster dose, aged care facilities have been left without rapid antigen tests and PPE. Aged care residents have been left without food, water and medical care because the government\u2019s surge workforce strategy was inaccurate, and despite aged care being in crisis, the minister for aged care services has declared this sector is performing exceptionally well, and therefore calls on the prime minister to immediately sack his minister for aged care services and secondly apologise to aged care residents and their families for his failure to listen and act on countless warnings about the continuing crisis in aged care.     The Leader of the Opposition @AlboMP has moved to suspend standing orders during #QT to enable him to move a motion relating to aged care services. The Leader of the House @PeterDutton_MP has moved &#39;That the Member be no longer heard&#39;. The House is dividing on the question.&mdash; Australian House of Representatives (@AboutTheHouse) February 8, 2022      Updated at 4.11am GMT     4.01am GMT       Back in question time, Burke is trying to make a point of order. He says Frydenberg is \u201ccompletely inventing things that are not true\u201d. The Speaker, Andrew Wallace, says Burke is not an arbiter of the truth. Dutton chimes in with:   This chamber is a contest of ideas on a test of character, and if he [Albanese] doesn\u2019t want his character tested, he should not be sticking his hand up for the job that he seeks.   Albanese refers to the statement earlier \u2013 the apology for the toxic culture in parliament house and calls to lift standards \u2013 and asks what that means if people can just get up and \u201csay anything at all\u201d.  Aaaaaaaand then Frydenberg is up again saying Albanese\u2019s supporters were known as the Bolsheviks.  Yeah, it\u2019s messy.     Updated at 4.04am GMT     3.56am GMT    Craig Kelly signs anti-mandate protesters into Parliament House    Interrupting question time briefly to bring you news of the protestors who are now in Parliament House. United Australia party leader, Craig Kelly, managed to get several representatives of the anti-mandate protests into Parliament House, signing them into the building under the watchful eye of security and police. Kelly brought in around 10 protesters at around 1pm on Tuesday afternoon, including anti-lockdown activist Simeon Boikov, who creates YouTube content under the name Aussie Cossack and protest spokesperson Graham Hood. A dozen police and security trailed them back to Kelly\u2019s office, after checking their claims of having exemptions to Parliament\u2019s rules requiring face masks be worn inside. Protesters claimed they wanted to meet Morrison and Albanese in order to present a list of \u201cgrievances\u201d over vaccine mandates. But other parliament rules require visitors to be signed into the building directly by the offices they are visiting, meaning the protesters would not be able to simply drop-in on the PM or Labor leader. Security and police stood in the halls outside Kelly\u2019s office, ready to direct the protesters back outside Parliament House once their meeting was over. Speaking to media inside Kelly\u2019s office, the protesters denied they were \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d, instead saying they opposed vaccination mandates. Hood has told supporters to remain peaceful and not confront police, but several protesters have been arrested and one was allegedly found with a gun in his car last week. At a small protest outside parliament on Monday, one speaker gave a speech saying, \u201cwe are coming for you... we are emptying this building,\u201d and warning of a \u201cmess\u201d. Hood said \u201c98% of the rallies were people just like us\u201d, while other protesters claimed that \u201cthere\u2019s crazy people working [in Parliament] too\u201d. Hood also gave a speech at a rally on Saturday, where he called Parliament House a \u201csatanic\u201d building. He stood by that claim when asked by Guardian Australia, saying he wanted \u201cto take it on\u201d and that the vaccine debate was a \u201cbattle between good and evil\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m a man of faith and all the other stuff that\u2019s causing this doesn\u2019t come from God,\u201d Hood said. The protest group appears to still be in Kelly\u2019s office.    Updated at 5.17am GMT     3.51am GMT       Albanese is again asking about aged care. Morrison is making a distinction (again) between those who\u2019ve died \u201cwith\u201d Covid and those who\u2019ve died \u201cof\u201d Covid, which is technically correct but also appears to be diminishing the number of deaths in aged care. And Morrison says that the opposition is trying to pretend there are no pressures on the system.     Updated at 3.53am GMT     3.46am GMT       The Speaker dismisses Tony Burke, who says the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is talking \u201cgibberish\u201d. Frydenberg took a Dorothy Dixer and turned it into an attack on the opposition.  The Speaker says Frydenberg\u2019s comments are relevant. There\u2019s a brouhaha. Labor\u2019s Pat Conroy is booted. The government\u2019s leader of the house, Peter Dutton, says the Speaker made \u201ca very good ruling\u201d. And Frydenberg is off again, claiming Albanese will introduce new taxes and won\u2019t stand up to the unions. Albanese says:   This is embarrassing. This is nothing to do with any policy, this is some rant about some alleged union I worked for or something, I don\u2019t know what it is, an attempted personal character assassination which has nothing to do with the question that was asked.     Updated at 3.51am GMT     3.42am GMT       The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, is trying to get a question past the Speaker on the religious discrimination act. Bandt said the amendments would mean \u201ca school can sack an unmarried teacher if she is pregnant if it is against their beliefs, a doctor can tell their patient their sickness is from God because they are gay and a student can be expelled because they are transgender\u201d.  Morrison is saying, as he did earlier, that the question does not go to his bill (it\u2019s a little tricky, see Paul Karp\u2019s story for the explanation).  Morrison said:   What I am introducing and what I introduced to this dispatch box was a set of positive laws which were about the sexual discrimination act, about positive laws that prevent discrimination against people of religious faith or who have no religious faith. The issues that are contained in that bill did not provide the powers to do the things that you talk about. Those powers exist in the law as it stands today, as was introduced by the Labor Party when they were last in government.   He goes on to say:   If those in this chamber want to speak about multiculturalism and how great a multicultural society it is, then they must acknowledge the role of faith and culture in this country, and if they want to support multiculturalism in this chamber, then I urge them to support the bill.     Updated at 3.45am GMT     3.36am GMT       Albanese to Morrison again: \u201cWhy does the prime minister reject good ideas then take actions that are too little, too late, and after a problem has become a crisis?\u201d (He\u2019s talking about sending in the ADF to support the health system).  Morrison accuses Albanese of politicising the pandemic, then there\u2019s some pandemonium, then Morrison says Albanese has been \u201csnarling and growling\u201d and has been negative during the pandemic. He said:   [We] have come through this pandemic with the constant negativity, snarling and growling ... but the facts are these, on each occasion we have worked to address the situation that we have had before us. On each and every occasion, we have sought to apply the resources, whether they be the defence forces, indeed our own public service offices and those around the country to address the needs that have been required, and particularly in the aged care sector, where defence forces were applied in Victoria during the second wave and are now being used in a similar way with targeted interventions, not with the wholesale replacement of the aged care workforce.     Updated at 3.39am GMT     3.29am GMT       Labor\u2019s Clare O\u2019Neil has asked why the prime minister has not sacked the aged care services minister (that\u2019s Richard Colbeck) for saying the aged care system was working \u201cexceptionally well\u201d.  Morrison says Australia is not doing as badly as other countries, and points to a bonus payment being made to aged care staff \u2013 a payment that has been heavily criticised. Morrison says that payment, along with changes to the close contact rules, are helping the sector deal with the challenges of Omicron.  And he says, again, that it is misleading to pretend the pandemic would have no effect on the vulnerable. (Again, no one has said that). The health and aged care minister, Greg Hunt, added:  In terms of the specific response to support the aged care sector, which I would hope is the real concern of every person in this house, masks 14.8m units, gloves, 17.5m units, gowns, 25.9m units, all of these are real actions that have been taken to support that sector. In addition to that, the changed [furloughing arrangements] were fundamental in ensuring the continuity of workforce in terms of the definition of close contact but also the capacity and critical sectors such as aged care for asymptomatic close contacts to work.  That has been backed up by 80,000 shifts which have been put in place by the government and in addition the support for workforce retention and now the Australian defence force [which is also supporting the aged care workforce].     Updated at 3.34am GMT     3.23am GMT       Labor MP Tim Watts was asked to withdraw an unparliamentary comment. Watts said: \u201cI said the prime minister was a fraud and I do not believe that is unparliamentary\u201d.    Updated at 3.26am GMT     3.22am GMT       Morrison went on to say it would be \u201cnaive and misleading and ... false\u201d to pretend the pandemic would not impact the most vulnerable people in the community.  (I am not sure anyone is, in fact, saying that.) Morrison said:  Our government will continue to do everything we can to support those in residential aged care facilities and those working with them ... we work to try and provide support to those who are most vulnerable.     Updated at 3.27am GMT     3.18am GMT       Albanese goes into question time with a question on the aged care crisis, and asks whether the prime minister, Scott Morrison, will take responsibility for the deaths.  Morrison said:  The pandemic takes a heavy toll in this country, as it has over the course of this pandemic ... since the beginning of this year, it is true that in aged care facilities, 587 people as of the 7 February have died with Covid. I note also that since the 1 January of this year up until the 28 January, some 4141 people who were in aged care have passed away. Since the onset of Omicron, some 682 people have died in aged care facilities ... and some 9141 people who have been residents in aged care have passed away.     Updated at 3.23am GMT     3.16am GMT       The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is now adding his congratulations to Queen Elizabeth II on her platinum jubilee. He said she \u201chas been a rare, constant, and enduring, inspiring presence of calm, decency and strength\u201d:   No jubilee, no matter how happy, is without a tinge of sadness. This is her first without Prince Philip. Half of a partnership so close that the tenderness could be glimpsed between the layers of formality and tradition. It is also a celebration of a reign that began with the premature death of her adored father, George VI.  When he died, the young Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya, en route to Australia. The relatively carefree life they had envisioned for themselves in those early years of marriage was over. Princess Elizabeth returned to England as Queen. The responsibilities of the throne on one shoulder, the sudden absence of her father on the other.  She had to find the strength amidst her grief to measure up to the expectations of a nation and the great weight of the institution into which she was born.  He went on to say:  You can be a republican, as I am, and still have the deepest respect for the Queen. She has done her duty with fidelity, integrity, humanity, and as she sometimes let slip with a sly sense of humour.      Updated at 3.20am GMT     3.11am GMT       Back to Morrison\u2019s tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. He has peppered it with pop culture references, including James Bond and the Crown.  He finished with: \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d.  In between, he said:   In past jubilees, silver, diamond, gold, there has been unbridled joy, a celebration of a life of service, a reminder of the ties that bind, an expression of the affectionate history we share. In the midst of these celebrations, we know that our Queen will stand alone, as she did during the service that farewelled her loved husband of some 73 years. On that day, we all truly saw her, stoic and strong, yet human and frail and vulnerable. Dignity in the midst of suffering. Even if it is her own.  In that moment, we realised that ... even monarchs face the frailties of the body and the sunsets that beckoned us all. But still, at 95, Her Majesty continues to serve, and passionately so.  As a constitutional monarch, she lived out her belief that monarchy must be above politics, and the Queen played no role in that [republican referendum] campaign, pledging to respect and accept the result. And after that debate had passed, she said: \u2018I shall continue to faithfully serve as Queen of Australia under the constitution to the very best of my ability, as I have tried to do for these past 48 years, as my duty to seek to remain true to the interests of Australia and all Australians as we enter into the 21st century\u2019, and so she has done.

Laming said:  These students are usually not expelled. Too often they\u2019re bullied out by a range of other tactics, that allow the school to say they never expelled them.  Laming said schools are not just about delivering faith, but delivering education, and students who are \u201cthere for the right reasons\u201d deserve to complete their education. Laming wants broader protection of LGBTQ+ students \u2013 we will clarify what that means for his vote on the religious discrimination bill.    Updated at 3.09am GMT     3.05am GMT       We are barrelling towards question time, but first the prime minister, Scott Morrison, is congratulating Queen Elizabeth II on being the Queen for seventy years:   We express our respect to the dedication you have displayed in the service of the commonwealth [and] deep and abiding commitment to Australia and its people.  Princess Elizabeth was on her way to Australia 70 years ago. The world as she knew it changed forever. Her beloved father had died. A young princess in her 20s in the first years of her marriage with two young children became Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in a Commonwealth of Nations that spanned the globe.  The Queen has never celebrated this day, and understandably so. I am sure she would have preferred to enjoy her father\u2019s love, an example for many more years before she was called upon to wear that heavy crown.  A reminder that no matter who we are, events happen in life, events out of our control that require more of us than we think sometimes we may be able. In a moment of immense sadness, and with the tremendous grace and poise and dignity and strength for which she has become known all around the world, and particularly here in Australia, Her Majesty commenced her duties as our Queen.  Her life is one of dedication of duty and devotion, of service over self, of stead and unflinching adherence to the ideals and the responsibility of constitutional monarchy.     Updated at 3.30am GMT     3.00am GMT       The National Women\u2019s Safety Alliance has responded to today\u2019s statement. Chief executive, Dr Renee Hamilton, said it was \u201can important step in changing culture and practices\u201d but that gender equality needed to be tackled:   Safety is everyone\u2019s business and the Australian parliament \u2013 just like all workplaces \u2013 has an obligation to provide a safe work environment. But we cannot make real change in any workplace unless we address the main driver of violence against women: gender inequality. As the government implements all 28 recommendations, people with lived experience and experts in gender-based violence need to have a seat at the table. Words are important, especially when they are spoken from Australia\u2019s seat of power. But genuine action based on equality and respect must be what happens next.     Updated at 3.03am GMT     2.52am GMT       Christian Schools Australia, which is one of the groups that threatened to withdraw support for the religious discrimination bill if it prevented discrimination against LGBTQ+ students, has given its seal of approval to the more limited amendments that prevent expulsion of gay students. CSA director of public policy, Mark Spencer, said:  As we have made very clear over many years, Christian schools have never expelled students simply on the basis of sexual orientation.  That \u201csimply\u201d should send a shiver down the spine \u2013 because one must remember that schools can still discriminate against teachers and students for their views.  For example, they might decide to punish someone who thinks that being a practising gay person and Christian can be compatible. Spencer said:  We welcome these targeted amendments to address the fears created by activists and once and for all settle that expulsion of students simply on the basis of their sexual orientation is not lawful. We support the review by the ALRC of the far more complicated issues regarding other protected attributes, including gender identity ... Supporting gender questioning students is complex and schools need to be able to deal with these issues on a case-by-case basis, balancing the needs of those students with other students, finding ways to support all families within the school community. The increasing concerns around appropriate treatment regimes, how access to facilities can be managed, and what impacts arise in relation to sporting activities are just some of the practical issues that need consideration.     Updated at 2.56am GMT     2.46am GMT       Malcolm Turnbull has offered a typically blunt assessment of the Morrison government\u2019s energy policies in a webinar hosted by the Clean Energy Council. Speaking on a panel after interviews with several federal MPs, the former Liberal prime minister said the government he used to lead had \u201cbasically checked out\u201d of leading on energy. He said:  It\u2019s got a bundle of aspirations but no policy on how you\u2019re going to get there.  Turnbull said in reality the government was putting \u201cvery little\u201d funding into developing a hydrogen industry, and even less into \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d made with renewable energy. He said the focus on \u201cblue hydrogen\u201d \u2013 which is made with gas, with carbon dioxide emissions captured and stored or used, rather than released into the atmosphere \u2013 was \u201cessentially a con\u201d and \u201cabsolutely terrible from a greenhouse gas point of view\u201d as carbon capture and storage hardly ever worked. Turnbull is the Australian chairman of the mining billionaire Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Future Industries, which is heavily backing green hydrogen. The company ran a full-page ad in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday declaring that, contrary to government claims, only green hydrogen is \u201cclean hydrogen\u201d, and that the emissions from blue hydrogen can be 20% higher than from burning coal or gas for heat. Turnbull told the forum the future of green hydrogen was likely to be \u201cbetween gigantic and very gigantic\u201d, particularly in making green steel, aluminium and ammonia. The Clean Energy Council has released a future roadmap for renewable energy ahead of the election, urging politicians to back steps that could lead to the country meeting all domestic electricity needs using clean energy by 2030. The group\u2019s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said:  Now is the time to exploit Australia\u2019s natural advantages to bring down the cost of electricity ... and position the country as the innate home of energy-intensive industries in the Asia Pacific.     Updated at 2.50am GMT     2.26am GMT       In addition to MPs Katie Allen and Fiona Martin, Guardian Australia understands that Trent Zimmerman and Warren Entsch also spoke up against the religious discrimination bill and argued amendments did not go far enough. Martin, a psychologist with 20 years experience, focused on her concerns for the mental health of young people and the fact kids with gender identity issues such as gender dysphoria, or transgender children are one of the most vulnerable cohorts. Martin holds the culturally diverse inner-Sydney seat of Reid, where Hinduism is the second largest faith group \u2013 and the Hindu Council of Australia has actually warned that minority religions face greater discrimination as a result of the bill. Martin wants the Sex Discrimination Act amended to protect all kids, including on the grounds of gender identity. We\u2019re still gathering a full speaker list but gather Liberal Lucy Wicks spoke about her Christian views and how others\u2019 \u201clifestyle/behaviour\u201d shouldn\u2019t prevent schools setting their own ethos.

The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, spoke about the government\u2019s proposed response to the inquiries and proposed amendments \u2013 but the meeting was interrupted by the apology and acknowledgement of sexual harassment. The meeting will reconvene after question time. Guardian Australia understands the proposed changes are:  Fix constitutional problems with the statement of belief and employment practices clauses (but otherwise do not address concerns that they will override state laws). Clarify what schools\u2019 written policies need to have before they can discriminate. Add a section 38(4) to the Sex Discrimination Act to prevent expulsion of students on the basis of sexuality \u2013 but no protection against other forms of discrimination or on the grounds of gender identity.  These changes have not been formally adopted yet as government policy, so Labor can still (rightly) say it hasn\u2019t seen the final bill.  We know Liberal MP Angie Bell came out of the meeting saying she now supports the bill. But MPs Katie Allen and Fiona Martin expressed concerns that the SDA change excludes trans children. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said:  We were very clear that this was a bill that we wanted to see passed, so it will go to the parliament.  In the lower house, second reading speeches on the religious discrimination bill have recommenced, with Labor MP Graham Perrett criticising aspects of the bill including the statement of belief and employment practices, but describing the rest of it as \u201clargely uncontroversial\u201d. Perrett says changes need to be made to the Sex Discrimination Act, describing it as \u201cutterly repugnant\u201d for schools to be allowed to use contracts to discriminate against LGBTQ+ children.

Water police were called to Greenwich reserve in Williamstown at about 4pm on Monday by marine animal experts from Melbourne Zoo. Two inflatable rescue boats carrying four officers were sent out and a sling was made to tow the marooned mammal into deeper water. Animal experts assessed the dolphin before it was successfully released. Leading senior constable Tony Christensen said:  Our members often see dolphins in the bay during patrols and it\u2019s great to see this one back where it belongs. We hope to cross paths again \u2013 but this time well away from shore.

The chief executive of LGBTQ+ lobby Equality Australia, Anna Brown, said the government amendments are \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d because they \u201cfail to protect gay children\u201d from suspension, detention and unfair treatment, and \u201ccompletely\u201d leave behind the most vulnerable, trans children. Ian Thorpe said parliament should do everything it can to protect the most marginalised \u2013 trans children \u2013 and that the bill has \u201cno friends in parliament\u201d. A spokesperson for the Hindu Council of Australia said the bill allows discrimination in hiring by religious institutions \u2013 which is harmful for smaller/newer religious groups in Australia, because they don\u2019t have schools and hospitals of their own, and staff face pressure to convert if they find a job at the institution of another religion. Olivia Stewart, a transgender student, said she had been \u201cdirectly discriminated against\u201d by a school, who asked her to leave after warning she would be bullied for her gender identity. Sean Drummond, a disability advocate, said the bill \u201cpits thoughts and prayers\u201d against rights of groups including people with disability.    Updated at 1.52am GMT     1.45am GMT       While we\u2019re on the religious discrimination bill \u2013 debate has resumed in the parliament. I won\u2019t bring you the blow by blows, but stay tuned for any highlights and Paul Karp will (again) pull it all together for you.     Updated at 1.48am GMT     1.43am GMT       Liberal MP Angie Bell has revealed she will vote for the religious discrimination bill on the basis that she has secured protections for children with differing sexual orientation (but not trans children). Bell said in a statement:  I will honour my commitment to the prime minister and his election commitment, to support the religious discrimination bill having successfully secured greater protections at the same time, through amendments to the sex discrimination act for children based on their sexual orientation. I will always advocate for an Australia free from discrimination for all. This bill and the amendments I have successfully advocated for are an important step in the right direction.  On why she is not insisting that gender identity discrimination be removed at the same time, Bell said:  There is still work to be done to see an Australia free from all discrimination, but it is important we make changes to legislation now that will assist in these efforts and not allow this opportunity to be lost. Transitioning students are at the highest risk of experiencing mental health difficulties and present particular challenges for single sex schools. Those details will be looked at through the ALRC process and reported back 12 months after the passage of the religious discrimination bill.

No structural problems here, my friend&mdash; Sarah Martin (@msmarto) February 8, 2022         1.34am GMT       The speeches are still going, but Brittany Higgins has left \u2013 Rachelle Miller also left the chamber but has come back in.     Updated at 1.34am GMT     1.33am GMT       The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has also spoken:  Parliament House should be the safest workplace in the country. Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t. And most certainly in the past, wasn\u2019t. The experiences people shared as part of the Jenkins review are truly disturbing and confronting. [These] experiences have no place in any workplace let alone our parliament.  I thank every individual who participated in the review. Your experiences have been heard and will be acted on. I join both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition in saying sorry and acknowledging that we will do better.  We are a unique position \u2013 we can bring about change for the better. There is no easier place to bring about change than the place where we are working ... we are taking merely the first step to fix the culture and the broken system to provide a workplace that is safe.  Together, we are committed to make Parliament House the safest workplace in the country and a reflection to our nation of a model workplace for us all to work in.  The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, paid tribute to the thousands of women who marched for justice, and pointed out that half the parliamentary staff had experienced bullying, harassment or assault in their time at work.  \u201cThe blame is ours. The shame is ours,\u201d he said:  Men have failed. Failed to act with respect, failed to act with basic human decency, failed to listen and failed to make the changes necessary when asked. As men we need to change our behaviours and we are committed to that.     Updated at 2.48am GMT     1.26am GMT       ...     How about some proactive, preventative measures and not just these performative, last-minute bandaid electioneering stunts?&mdash; Grace Tame (@TamePunk) February 8, 2022         1.25am GMT       The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has also said sorry and highlighted the need for immediate action. He said:   [The Jenkins report] catalogues in personal testimony and shocking statistics our failure to [lead by example]. It is also a demand that we act right now. We owe a debt of gratitude to everyone in this building as well as every former staff member who stepped up to share their experiences of workplace bullying and misconduct, of sexual harassment and most dramatically, of sexual assault. I also knowledge particularly the women who have bravely stood up and called out a culture of mistreatment that brought this issue into the light. I particularly pay tribute to the courage of Brittany Higgins who is with us today.  You have torn through a silence that has acted as the life-support system for the most odious of status quos. To describe your experiences is to relive them. I say to everyone who took part, that took a level of courage that you should never have needed to show. But you did. And we thank you for it.  We also knowledge everyone who has experienced misconduct but could not take part. Indeed, there are many who are not ready to speak and perhaps never will be. But I hope you can take some heart from knowing that this very institution that failed you is at last acknowledging your hurt. Most importantly, we are sorry. We are committing to change.  The Jenkins report, with its piercing honesty about the treatment of women and men both, has exposed a damaged culture but no word any of us says in here is worth a thing if it does not lead to action.  We can make a difference but it would take real and sustained effort to create the lasting cultural change that we need. I believe we can do it. I know that we have to. And how we can start doing that is by working across the parliament to implement every single recommendation of the Jenkins report. That is the absolute minimum we should be doing for the staff who are, in so many ways, the fuel and the engine of parliament ... No-one deserves to feel unsafe or disrespected any workplace, let alone our national parliament. Let us be the example for Australia that the national parliament ought to be. While the report concerns itself with this place, it is part of something bigger. An overdue national reckoning.     Updated at 1.32am GMT     1.20am GMT       Morrison goes on to thank commissioner Kate Jenkins and repeats the Speaker\u2019s statement that parliament should have \u201cthe high standards of a place where any Australian can aspire to work\u201d.  Morrison said:   [Jenkins] said this is an opportunity for the leaders of our country to transform and commonwealth parliamentary workplaces to become what they already should be. Workplaces where expected standards of behaviour [are modelled], championed and enforced. And where respectable behaviour is rewarded and which any Australian, no matter gender, race, sexual orientation, disability status or age, feel safe and welcome to contribute.  That is our task, she has set it out clearly. We must hold ourselves to the standard, all of us. I hesitate in calling it a new standard, because that [suggests it] should not have been previously. This is a standard that should be outside of time. Because by taking an oath or affirmation that this very table, it means you are a leader. Whatever role in which you serve.  Mr Speaker, we have understood in this place the power of an apology to bring healing and to bring change. I am proud that this is a chamber in which we have done this on so many occasions, but I believe Australia is somewhat unique in this regard.  We ... have sought to silence the valid and just complaints of people because there was fear about electoral consequences. I am sorry. We are sorry. I am sorry to [Brittany] Higgins for the terrible things that took place here. And the place that should have been a place for safety and contribution, turned out to be a nightmare. I am sorry for far more than that. [Higgins] had the courage to speak, and so here we are. We are sorry for all of these things, and in doing so, each of us take on accountability for change. For those of us who have perpetuated the bullying and violence, the light will come to those behaviours. As it must.     Updated at 1.30am GMT     1.12am GMT       \u201cI am sorry. We are sorry,\u201d Morrison said.     Updated at 1.16am GMT     1.12am GMT       Prime minister Scott Morrison says he rises to \u201centhusiastically support\u201d the statement, and to recognise \u201call of those who are why we are here today in making this acknowledgement\u201d. He said:   I particularly want to acknowledge Brittany Higgins, whose experience, and more importantly courage, is the reason why we are all here today. And I want to thank her for that. I also want to recognise all of those who have contributed to the Jenkins review. Some 1700 individuals contributed. 935 participated in the surveys from right across this building ... those who work and call this place their place of work. 490 interviews were conducted, 11 focus groups were undertaken.  This review speaks of a long-standing culture, generations of culture, in this place and in the building before it, of bullying and harassment that has occurred over this time. A power imbalance over that time that has been exploited. And that exploitation, abuse and harassment has played itself out through terrible traumatic and harrowing experiences. The harassment of staff, particularly female staff, as well as the harassment of female members and senators. Over many decades, the culture [that] perpetuated bullying, abuse, harassment and in some cases even violence became normalised. This has to change, it is changing, and I believe it will change.     Updated at 1.15am GMT     1.06am GMT    Parliament acknowledges workplace bullying, harassment and sexual assault    Here is the full statement of acknowledgement:   In the final sitting week of 2021 the Independent Review into Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces was published by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins.  Today, on the first sitting day of 2022, we deliver this statement on behalf of the Parliamentary Cross-Party Leadership Taskforce recommended by Commissioner Jenkins and as a reflection of the Parliament. We acknowledge the unacceptable history of workplace bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces.  This issue is of the greatest importance and the responsibility of all people who work in this place. Any bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault is unacceptable and wrong. We say sorry.  Every workplace should be safe and respectful. This place and its members are committed to bringing about lasting and meaningful change to both culture and practice within our workplaces. We have failed to provide this in the past. We today declare our personal and collective commitment to make the changes required. We will aspire, as we should, to set the standard for the nation.  We thank all of those who participated in the Jenkins Review, acknowledging everyone who came forward to tell us of their experiences. We also acknowledge the many others who could not or did not participate but who may have experienced misconduct. We know that your experiences have had profound and far-reaching impacts on your lives. We have listened and heard you, and we accept your calls for change.  This Parliament should serve as a model workplace for our nation. Only by creating the best workplace will this parliament attract the best people our country has to offer. And only by attracting the best our country has to offer, and listening to the communities we represent, will we deliver the high standards that our country deserves.  Parliamentary workers feel pride in working for their country, and the privilege and honour of making a difference for the Australian people. However, for far too many, it has not been safe or respectful. The Jenkins Review proposes an ambitious program of reform to ensure Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces meet the highest standards. We are fully committed to working across the Parliament to implement all of these recommendations within the timeframes proposed by Commissioner Jenkins.  We have started to act. Last year, we established a new independent complaints process and began providing trauma-informed support for people who have experienced serious incidents working in the Parliament. Members, Senators and staff have undertaken professional workplace training.  Parliamentarians must uphold the highest standards and be accountable for delivering required actions. We know that cultural change has to come from the top \u2013 it has to be role modelled and championed by all of us.  While we know we cannot undo the harm that has already been done, we are committed to acknowledging the mistakes of the past and continuing to build safe and respectful workplaces.     Updated at 1.16am GMT     12.48am GMT       Australian officials have been denied consular access to a dual Australian-Chinese citizen who is being prosecuted in Hong Kong under the sweeping new national security law. The ABC has reported that the man \u2013 first arrested on 6 January last year, released on bail the next day and then re-arrested on 1 March \u2013 is accused of \u201cconspiring to subvert state power\u201d. The ABC report says the man has spent the past 11 months in jail and faces a potential jail term ranging from 10 years to life, if convicted of subversion. In a statement, a spokesperson for Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said:  The Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong was notified by Hong Kong authorities of the arrest of a dual Australian-Chinese citizen under its National Security Law in January 2021. Officials from our Consulate-General have attended the subsequent court hearings. However, we have been denied consular access despite multiple attempts because the individual is deemed to be a Chinese citizen under China\u2019s citizenship laws, which do not recognise dual nationality. We are in regular contact with the individual\u2019s lawyers and will continue to attend future court hearings. Australia and many other countries have expressed concern about the erosion of basic freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong and have called on Hong Kong and Chinese authorities to abide by their human rights obligations. The Hong Kong National Security Law could be interpreted broadly and therefore result in detention that is arbitrary or lacks transparency as well as the removal of basic individual rights.  The man\u2019s case was first mentioned in Australian Senate estimates hearings in October, but there were few details before now.

A piece published by the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday, led by the University of Wollongong\u2019s Prof Kathy Eagar, calculates that aged care residents comprise 0.74% of the Australian population and 0.59% of Covid-19 cases. Yet they represent 36.87% of all Covid-19 deaths in the pandemic so far. Eagar and her colleague Anita Westera wrote that ongoing systemic failures in aged care were exacerbated by issues including decisions to end lockdowns and ease restrictions based on vaccination rates rather than whether the aged care sector was prepared; aged care booster programs not being complete before restrictions were eased; poor access to rapid antigen tests; and inadequate personal protective equipment. Other issues identified by the authors include poor pay for staff, less experienced staff being employed to cut costs, \u201ca long-held agenda within the centre of government to curtail projected costs associated with an ageing population\u201d and the commonwealth\u2019s \u201chands-off approach to aged care\u201d. They wrote:  The current crisis yet again reflects the reactive and iterative policy making that has characterised aged care in recent decades. And while responsibility for aged care remains centrally controlled at the national level, this is unlikely to change.

A Greens spokesperson told a media briefing after their party room meeting that they would introduce more modest amendments in the House.

He said:   I think everybody should be treated fairly, properly and that\u2019s exactly the arrangements that we have in place ... In terms of the interaction between changes at a Victorian level and a commonwealth level, well there\u2019s a few things to be settled there.  Late last year, the Victorian parliament passed laws banning religious schools from sacking or refusing to hire staff based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. Andrews confirmed the Victorian government is seeking legal advice on how to defend its laws if the federal bill passes:  We will use any and all legal avenues to defend those who ought to be treated fairly and equally and might not be under any arrangements where a commonwealth act overrode or set aside provisions of a state act that duly passed the parliament.  Andrews said he wanted \u201cevery student to be treated equally\u201d. He continued:   I want every Victorian to be confident, safe, respected, included for who they are. And I must say it\u2019s pretty offensive for some in the community to equate sexual orientation or gender identity to a choice not to get vaccinated. That\u2019s the wrong choice. People\u2019s identity is not a matter of choice; who you are is who you are, who you love, is a matter for you. You should be treated fairly and equitably. You should not be discriminated against based on who you are. That\u2019s just my view. It also happens to be the view of the Victorian community.

He welcomed the federal government\u2019s decision to reopen the Australian border to tourists and all visa holders, provided they have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine:  Firstly, I think we all were a bit amused at the timeline that had been put forward by the commonwealth government around Easter, I thought that was ... some time off and perhaps we could do better than that. It\u2019s great yesterday that the commonwealth were able to confirm that it will be much sooner than that. That\u2019s good for the economy, for jobs, so that\u2019s something that we fully support.   Andrews said national cabinet is still awaiting advice from Australia\u2019s independent expert group on vaccination, Atagi, on whether it will change the definition of fully vaccinated to mean three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. He said:   They (Atagi) must be getting very close to making that decision. We\u2019ve got a national cabinet meeting on Thursday, hopefully we can receive it before then or at that meeting. All the international evidence, all the advice I get from our team is that three doses is what\u2019s required in order to be as safe as it can be.  Andrews said if the definition of fully vaccinated changed for Australians, he expected the same would apply for international arrivals:   That would be consistent with the approach they\u2019ve taken ... Let\u2019s just wait and see what Atagi comes up with. But I think it\u2019s highly likely, the weight of evidence suggests a booster or third dose is not really an optional extra. It\u2019s critically important and it\u2019s not just for now, there\u2019s also for whatever comes at us when the weather turns later in the year.   Andrews announced free rapid antigen tests will be made available for children aged three to five attending early childhood services in the coming weeks. The program, which involves children being tested twice a week, will be \u201cvoluntary, but highly recommended\u201d, he said.

Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister Kristina Keneally warned that some protesters \u201cseek to do real harm\u201d and that the groups \u201ccontain individuals that our national security agencies are worried about\u201d. \u201cSome of these protesters actually want to undermine and overturn democracy,\u201d Keneally told a press conference. She noted a protester who was arrested last week after police allegedly found a gun in his car:  Not all the people who are here to protest are here to protest peacefully ... There are individuals here who have expressed support for doing physical harm, indeed execution of parliamentary representatives, judges and the like.  Protest leaders told supporters in social media videos to remain \u201cpeaceful\u201d. However, at a small protest outside parliament on Monday, one speaker gave a speech saying \u201cwe are coming for you ... we are emptying this building\u201d and warning of a \u201cmess\u201d. Keneally also accused the federal government of \u201ccurrying favour with extremists\u201d, citing support for the rallies from Coalition MPs George Christensen and Gerard Rennick, and former Liberal Craig Kelly. She called for prime minister Scott Morrison to pull his members into line:  Mr Morrison needs to take seriously the integrity of our parliament, the security of our parliamentarians, and the staff who work here and indeed make clear to members of his government, it is not appropriate for them to be going out and giving support to people who seek to enact violence upon this building.  Kelly told Guardian Australia on Monday that he planned to sign in a small contingent of protesters into parliament today, potentially to hold a press conference and try to meet with Morrison or Labor leader Anthony Albanese. Morrison\u2019s office said the PM had no plans to meet the protesters.

Because the draft amendments Scott Morrison has proposed to the Sex Discrimination Act are so narrow they only prevent same-sex attracted students from expulsion, not from other forms of discrimination. So Labor and equality advocates are concerned that other forms of punishment of gay, lesbian and bisexual students will still be allowed (short of expulsion), as will pregnancy discrimination. Labor has been coy about the fact it has seen draft amendments, relying on the fact that attorney general Michaelia Cash has said the bill isn\u2019t final until it\u2019s passed their party room, which explains why shadow attorney general Mark Dreyfus told the Labor caucus it hadn\u2019t seen the final bill.

He\u2019s talking about the religious discrimination bill \u2013 but according to reporting in the Nine newspapers, it\u2019s a parallel discussion over the sex discrimination laws that would protect students on the basis of their sexuality, but not on the basis of their gender. Morrison said:  You\u2019re referring to an existing law that was introduced by the Labor shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. He put that in place. This bill does not seek to endorse that arrangement. That\u2019s an existing law. What we\u2019re dealing with here today are not those matters. Those are going through a process with the Australian Law Reform Commission. We\u2019re dealing with discrimination against people for their religious belief and faith.

Updated at 9.33pm GMT     9.18pm GMT    Morrison says religious discrimination bill about 'binding Australia together, not forcing it apart'    Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now, after this morning\u2019s church service. He starts by speaking about the religious discrimination bill.  Morrison says many people of faith have come to Australia to escape discrimination and he doesn\u2019t want them to be discriminated against here.  For many Australians, their faith and religion is their culture. You can\u2019t separate them. When you listen to their stories, they will tell stories over hundreds of years and even longer, about how they as a people of faith and religion have survived through some of the worst things you can possibly imagine in countries around the world. But they came here to Australia so they could get away from that. And they could start a new life. So they could have their religious faith and they could have their belief and they could have their community and they could have their culture, and they would not be discriminated against. I don\u2019t want them to be discriminated against. Before the last election I said I wanted there to be laws in place that ensured their freedom from that discrimination. That\u2019s what this is about. There\u2019s many other laws in our parliament, many other laws that deal with many other things. And there\u2019s time and place to deal with those. But on this day, it\u2019s important that we remember that for so many Australians, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Hindu, if you\u2019re Sikh, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, if you choose to have no religious faith at all, we sing Australians \u2018one and free\u2019 and I hope that means something today as we gather together and seek to put in place the opportunity for those who wish to live their religion and live their faith, binding Australia together, not forcing it apart. This is why I made that pledge before the last election, and that is why I continue to stand very strongly on this point.

She asks him if the amendments have more protections for gay students, but not transgender students.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure we have seen the final amendments,\u201d Burke says.  He says they won\u2019t see the final version until the government has had a further meeting.  \u201cThe prime minister previously said he would end discrimination for all students and he should be true to his word on that.\u201d        8.55pm GMT    Trans children excluded from protections in religious discrimination bill    Simon Birmingham has confirmed to ABC\u2019s Radio National that under the federal government\u2019s religious discrimination bill, transgender students could still be expelled. As the federal government tries to keep both conservatives and moderates happy, it has made amendments to its original bill to protect people\u2019s sexuality, but not their gender. More to come.     Updated at 8.59pm GMT     8.43pm GMT       Don\u2019t let this pass you by today \u2013 rogue Nationals MP George Christensen has used $10,000 a month in taxpayers\u2019 money to pay for \u201ce-material\u201d. (And no, he wasn\u2019t promoting the science). Sarah Martin reports:    Related: George Christensen claims $10,000 a month for \u2018e-material\u2019 as he ramps up anti-vaccine mandate Facebook ads         8.34pm GMT       Hey, just in case you\u2019d forgotten about deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce calling prime minister Scott Morrison a liar and a hypocrite, nationals deputy leader David Littleproud is talking about it on ABC television.  He\u2019s worried that the text saga is distracting from the Nationals\u2019 real message.  He\u2019s trying not to, but he\u2019s still talking about the texts.  Littleproud says the Nationals will be campaigning on the \u201cwombat trail\u201d out in rural and regional Australia, but that Morrison and Joyce will (at some point) be out on the hustings together.

Updated at 8.31pm GMT     8.25pm GMT         See change in action. I encourage you to watch the opening of Parliament today for the historic Statement of Acknowledgment to Parliament: @AusHumanRights recommendation 1 of #SettheStandard Join House of Reps here https://t.co/M2zoLejt12 https://t.co/M2zoLejt12&mdash; Kate Jenkins (@Kate_Jenkins_) February 7, 2022         8.23pm GMT       Morning all. When parliament sits at noon, the presiding officers in both chambers will deliver a statement of acknowledgement about deficiencies (to put the problem diplomatically) in the workplace culture at Parliament House.  This implements one of the recommendations of the Jenkins review. (Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins ran an inquiry last year into workplace culture triggered by allegations raised by the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins.) Today\u2019s statement is a public apology to people who have endured bullying, harassment or worse while working for the commonwealth. As well as the formal acknowledgment, today\u2019s statement will outline next steps in reform.  After the presiding officers have delivered the statement, party leaders will speak. When I checked in with Higgins yesterday, she had not seen the wording of today\u2019s statement.  As I reported yesterday on the blog, former staffers who have led the push for change are also disappointed that the closure of the building to the public will prevent them attending today\u2019s statement. The government says provision will be made for some visitors. (Tory here, rudely busting into Murphy\u2019s piece \u2013 there is some chatter around this morning that the rude oversight will be rectified. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I do).    Updated at 8.28pm GMT     8.19pm GMT       It\u2019s the first sitting day of 2022, and if sitting day eve was anything to go by, it\u2019ll be firing on a number of fronts.  The religious discrimination bill will be up for debate. At this stage it seems rather unlikely that prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s hope it will unite the parliament will be fulfilled. He\u2019s off to the traditional parliamentary ecumenical service at 7.30am, so thoughts and prayers are on the way.  There will be a statement of acknowledgement in parliament around midday. It was a recommendation of the Jenkins review that the workplace culture of bullying, sexual assault and harassment in parliamentary workplaces should be publicly acknowledged. That was a recommendation of the Jenkins review, and there is word it will include an apology. It\u2019s likely there were other apologies flying around yesterday amid news that former staffers Rachelle Miller and Brittany Higgins had not been invited \u2013 despite being instrumental in the review itself.  That is likely to have been remedied. Shortly I\u2019ll bring you some more info on that statement.  Then there\u2019ll be more talk of tomorrow\u2019s National Press Club appearance by Grace Tame and Higgins, who have become good friends through all of this.  Those text messages from Barnaby Joyce and the mystery minister disparaging the PM are still the topic of talk, as a symptom of internal strife. And there\u2019s some strife without, as those pesky anti-vaccine protestors continue to threaten chaos.  As for legislation for a federal Icac ... wait and see. There have been mixed messages about whether the government will prioritise integrity over other issues.  Mike Bowers will bring you pictorial excellence, while Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst, Paul Karp and Josh Butler will be playing whack-a-mole with everything that is going on today.
