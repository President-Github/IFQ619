{"Queensland budget 2024: the biggest winners and losers [2024-06-11T04:38:46Z]": "The Queensland government\u2019s pre-election budget is aimed squarely at the hip pocket. \nThis year\u2019s budget is built around a series of cost-of-living handouts for the \u201cordinary\u201d Queenslander, including cheaper public transport and power. \nHere is a breakdown of the winners and losers in Queensland\u2019s 2024 state budget. \nWinners \nHouseholds, commuters and first home buyers \nThe premier, Steven Miles, and the treasurer, Cameron Dick, will hand $11.2bn in concessions to Queenslanders in this year\u2019s budget. This is 31% greater than last year. \n \n  Related: Queensland state budget 2024: 50c fares and $1,000 energy rebates favoured over surplus in pre-election spend  \n \nThat includes a series of headline-grabbing plans, such as a six-month \u201ctrial\u201d of 50c public transport fares, across the state\u2019s system. \nIt also means 20% discounts for car registration \u2013 and $1,000 back on power bills, and a freeze on all other fees and charges. \nBut much of the sugar hit expires early next year \u2013 just after election day. On budget day, both Dick and Miles denied the spend had anything at all to do with this year\u2019s election. \nThe government is also increasing the threshold for first home buyer stamp duty concessions by $200,000 to properties valued under $700,000. \nPolice and prisons \nAmid concern about crime in Queensland, the government is spending more than $1.2bn on community safety initiatives. \nSome of the money will go toward initiatives to prevent young people from offending or reoffending. Most of that money goes to police and prisons. \nMoney has been allocated to build a new youth remand centre at Wacol and a new youth detention centre at Woodford. There is more than $480m over four years to fund 900 new police officers, money for new police helicopters, and support for victims of crime. \nThe environment \nThe government is investing $26b in a brand new green power system for the state. \nIt includes billions for new power lines \u2013 including $1.06bn for CopperString 2032, which will connect Mt Isa to the grid \u2013 and state-owned projects such as a 2.3GW portfolio of renewable energy in central Queensland. \n \n  Related: Queensland government to fuel state\u2019s transition to renewable energy with $26bn investment  \n \nIt also includes $7bn towards state-owned pumped hydro, including $6bn for the Borumba scheme over the construction period and $1bn for the Pioneer-Burdekin scheme. \nThe budget doesn\u2019t include a final cost estimate for the enormous Pioneer-Burdekin hydro project in north Queensland, billed as the world\u2019s biggest battery. It is still estimated to cost just $12bn, substantially less than the smaller Borumba project, which will cost more than $14bn. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nBuilders \nThe government is expected to spend $107.3bn on infrastructure over the next four years. \nIts gigantic \u201cBig Build\u201d capital plan includes transport infrastructure such as Cross River Rail, housing supply, new health facilities and venues for the Olympics. \nEither way, it means plenty of work for tradies. \nThe annual capital program is expected to peak in 2025\u201326 at $29.4bn before spending declines 19% the following year. \nLosers \nPublic servants \nThe state government is looking to claw back $3bn from public servants over four years to 2027-28. \nThough the treasurer has vowed \u201cnot one public servant will lose their job\u201d, they may lose perks including business travel and external consultants \u2013 or be forced to work from home. \n\u201cI think we need to look afresh at all sorts of working arrangements for public servants \u2026 but it also might be not working in the Brisbane CBD,\u201d Dick said on Tuesday. \nThe government will also not contract for new advertising after August, other than for public safety or job ads. \nBudget bottom line \nQueensland\u2019s state government was once flush with coal revenue \u2013 even as others went deep into the red during the pandemic. \nIn 2023-23, the state ran a $13.9bn surplus. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nBut with minerals prices declining \u201csharply\u201d in recent weeks, government revenue is anticipated to shrink over the next 12 months, and level out the year after that. \nDebt is expected to hit a peak of $103.2bn in 2026\u201327, which is $6.5bn higher than in the 2023\u201324 budget update. \nDick said the state will still be in a much better position than peers Victoria and New South Wales, with 57% net debt in Queensland compared to 97% and 171%. \nPotential migrants \nMore than 134,700 people have moved to Queensland in the last four years, and the state is feeling growing pains. \nThe treasurer said forecasters were taken entirely by surprise by the \u201cunanticipated\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d explosion, comparing the growth to adding a second city the size of Mackay. \nMuch of the increase came from overseas, particularly in 2023. \n \n  Related:  Victorian state budget 2024: airport train delayed and sick leave for casuals scrapped in bid to rein in debt  \n \nBut a reduction in the migration intake at the commonwealth level \u2013 lobbied for by Miles \u2013 is set to change all this. \nThe budget assumes the heat will come out of population growth in the future, with population easing from 2.5% in 2023-24 to 1.5% for the next two years. \nThe government is hoping this will help the state manage its housing market back from crisis into health. \nTo be determined \nThe LNP \nThe opposition is well ahead in the polls. But the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, has so far aimed to keep a low profile, avoiding any large commitments. \nThe government\u2019s budget heaps additional pressure on the opposition to come up with their own plan. The treasurer all but dared Crisafulli to vote against part of the budget this morning, as they did in opposition \u2013 aiming to flush him out on its revenue measures. \nIn an unusual move, Miles used a Queensland day speech last week to attack the Liberal National party leader as \u201ceffectively trying to say to Queenslanders, you can have a Labor government just without the Labor party. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to fall for that\u201d. \nOn Thursday, he will give a highly anticipated hour-long budget reply address. The alternative premier will have to chart out an alternative course for Queensland. \nIt\u2019s yet to be seen if the can bear the pressure as election day looms.", "Queensland state budget 2024: 50c fares and $1,000 energy rebates favoured over surplus in pre-election spend [2024-06-11T04:00:44Z]": "The Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, says the government made a \u201cdeliberate choice\u201d to put the budget into deficit in order to fund a series of temporary cost-of-living measures ahead of the October election. \nHeavy discounts will be applied to public transport fares, electricity bills and car registration fees in 2024/25, culminating in a $2.6bn deficit, the government announced in Tuesday\u2019s budget. A \u201ctrial\u201d plan for 50c public transport fares lasts only six months and will end three months after election day. \nDick said a family could receive as much as $10,000 in household relief under the budget measures. That includes rebates of $1,000 on power bills, and a 20% reduction in car registration costs. Other fees and charges will be frozen at current levels. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cDelivering a deficit, spending more than the government collects in revenue, is not, and should never be an easy choice,\u201d Dick told parliament on Tuesday. \n\u201cBut in a contest between the balance sheet and doing what matters for Queenslanders, the Miles Labor government will always be on Queenslanders\u2019 side. \n\u201cWeak governments leave people to fend for themselves. Strong governments make the choice to intervene and invest.\u201d \n \n  Related: Queensland to spend $56m on forensic examination service for sexual assault victims  \n \nDick also said the state was challenged by population growth, particularly from overseas migration. The premier, Steven Miles, said he continues to support federal moves to cut migrant numbers. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going through, and may still be going through the biggest influx of people the state has ever seen \u2013 a city the size of Mackay that no one saw coming,\u201d Dick said. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nPolling has suggested Labor was facing a heavy defeat in October, after almost 10 years in power, after the retirement of long-serving premier Annastacia Palaszczuk last year. \nDick repeatedly used the phrase \u201cnew government\u201d and appeared to challenge the opposition leader, David Crisafulli, to vote against revenue measures in the parliament on Friday. \nAbout $3.7bn in spending is temporary and will expire before the end of the next financial year. \nQuestioned about whether short-term measures were timed to coincide with the election, Dick told reporters he expected interest rates to fall in the near future, meaning measures to counter inflation would only be required temporarily. \nBut the budget papers warned of the risk that inflation could be \u201cmore persistent than expected\u201d, which would delay rate cuts and hamper economic growth. \nTwo years ago, the state posted a record $13.93bn surplus, on the back of $10bn in additional revenue from controversial hikes to royalties. \nThe slide back into deficit has coincided with a crash in the metallurgical coal price, meaning royalties revert to prior rates. Next year, the state\u2019s income from coal royalties will drop back below 2022/23 levels. \n \n  Related: Queensland government to fuel state\u2019s transition to renewable energy with $26bn investment  \n \nThe budget also anticipates a 10.6% increase to health spending next year \u2013 a direct response to concern about hospital wait times, particularly in regional areas. \nAbout $1.3bn has been for law and order spending, including funding for already-announced youth remand facilities, a new youth detention centre, 900 new police officers, measures to support victims of crime, and several other programs. \nQueensland will spend $107.3bn on infrastructure \u2013 much of it to support energy transition \u2013 over four years. \nCost-of-living relief in the budget was designed to be non-inflationary \u2013 reductions in the cost of government services and charges, rather than measures that would put money into people\u2019s pockets and back into the economy. \nThe government said it was also designed to target two areas \u2013 housing (including power) and transport, which together make up about a third of the typical household\u2019s \u201cbasket of goods\u201d used to calculate inflation. \nDick said construction costs had increased 31% over three years \u2013 affecting the budget by hampering infrastructure projects, and also contributing to a slowdown in the construction of new housing. \n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve had to manage since Covid,\u201d Dick said. \n\u201cWe made that clear decision not to cut but to invest in infrastructure.\u201d \nTreasury warned \u201cconstruction activity has struggled to keep up with demand, significantly constrained by Covid-19-related material and labour shortages, poor weather and flooding, and construction company insolvencies.\u201d", "Queensland officially drought-free for first time since 2013 [2024-05-14T15:00:24Z]": "Queensland has been declared completely free of drought for the first time in 11 years. Months of flooding rains have transformed much of the state\u2019s dusty red-earth interior into a network of swollen creeks and rivers awash with green shoots and birdlife. Diamantina and Bulloo shires, located more than 1000km west of Brisbane in Queensland\u2019s channel country, this month became the last two local government areas to have their drought declarations officially revoked. They had been in drought since 2013.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  Droughts are \u201cburnt into the psyche\u201d of Jo Sheppard, the chief executive of the Queensland Farmers\u2019 Federation, experiencing many as she grew up on a cattle station in the neighbouring Paroo shire. \u201cA 10-year drought is incredibly difficult to endure \u2026 it takes its toll psychologically, it\u2019s that uncertainty, you have no idea when a drought will end,\u201d Sheppard said.   Related: Rain brings green shoots to Queensland, but not enough to avoid drought     The state\u2019s drought-free status is cause for celebration, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare occurrence and certainly welcome.\u201d Notwithstanding the state-wide declaration, there are still large pockets of land untouched by significant rainfall. According to the department of agriculture and fisheries, 35 properties across Queensland still hold \u201cindividual droughted property\u201d status. Pat Gibson grazes cattle in the Diamantina shire. Rainfall in January was welcome relief to some of the worst conditions he\u2019d ever seen, but he remains cautious about the years ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s always teetering on the borderline of drought out here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s central Australia, you\u2019re on the edge of the Simpson desert, you know it\u2019s going to be around the corner.\u201d In 2015, drought declarations peaked when 88% of Queensland was identified as in drought. The chair of the Agforce sustainability committee and central Queensland grazier, Mark Collins, said extensive rainfall across much of the state has given many producers \u201cbreathing space\u201d to \u201cenjoy the moment\u201d. Global heating has exacerbated recent droughts in Australia, and is predicted to increase their length and intensity in the future. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep adapting as best we can, farmers are innovative,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe cycle of drought and flood is one we are accustomed to.\u201d The federal government last week pledged $519m over eight years to fund the next stage of the Future Drought Fund, with a greater emphasis on global heating adaptation. The Productivity Commission last year found the fund, introduced by the previous Coalition government in 2019, underspent its annual budget and should focus more on programs with \u201clasting public benefit\u201d. Sheppard said farmers are becoming increasingly prepared for drought. \u201cI saw that within my own family in my lifetime \u2026 we certainly become a lot more strategic, rather than just hoping that the drought breaks,\u201d she said.

In the budget, it offers voters temporary cost-of-living relief in the form of heavily discounted public transport fares, $1,000 energy rebates and reduced car registration fees. \n \n  Related: Queensland budget 2024: the biggest winners and losers  \n \nEach of those discounts lasts only for a limited time \u2013 in the case of the cheap 50c bus and train tickets, they will expire three months after polling day. \nOne media outlet described the government\u2019s cost-of-living measures on Tuesday as \u201cpolitical sugar hits\u201d. In reality it\u2019s more like sachets of artificial sweetener. The high doesn\u2019t last. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nDick says the temporary nature of many of these measures is due to the likelihood that inflation will ease, and interest rates will begin to fall, in the next year. But Treasury has warned that inflation could be baked more deeply into the economy, and that things might not be so simple to fix. \nThe coal royalty boom is finished and won\u2019t return.

There\u2019s no point saving anything for the final stretch, if you begin the campaign 14 points down. The latest Redbridge poll had the LNP leading 57-43 on a two-party basis. \nDick was dismissive of questions that suggested the government was attempting to spend its way to an election win. \nHe also finished his budget speech talking about the election. \n\u201cQueenslanders will be asked to make a choice about their future, not to express an opinion about the past,\u201d he said. \nIt\u2019s a tough sell. The government is asking voters to think about the future \u2013 and forget about all the reasons they started to turn on Labor, after almost 10 years in power.

Is that really true?  \n \nThe Cbus cleanout is just one facet of the fallout from the Albanese government\u2019s decision to team up with the Coalition to pass legislation to appoint administrators to the CFMEU. \nLarge public rallies on Tuesday denounced Labor, with many participants taking unprotected industrial action which saw them docked at least four hours\u2019 pay, as industrial laws require employers not to pay employees if they don\u2019t turn up for work. \nThe New South Wales and ACT secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, Allen Hicks, said his branch is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in the Australian Council of Trade Unions for its \u201cunforgivable\u201d decision to support legislation that did not provide construction union officials \u201cnatural justice or procedural fairness\u201d. \nThe ETU, which donated more than $1m to Labor ahead of the last election, has decided it won\u2019t be donating to Labor again next election and suspended its affiliation fee, worth $780,000 a year, to the ACTU to protest against the suspension of the CFMEU from the union peak body. \nThe ETU national secretary, Michael Wright, said that \u201cserious allegations\u201d in the construction union should have been tested by court processes not \u201ctrial by parliament\u201d. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely worrying precedent, to legislate what should be court outcomes,\u201d Wright said, noting the NSW Liberals had already called for the ETU to be \u201cnext in line\u201d to crack down on \u201clawful industrial activism\u201d. \nSacked Queensland and Northern Territory construction secretary Michael Ravbar is expected to launch high court action this week, arguing the law breached the separation of powers and did not afford the CFMEU due process, because the Fair Work Commission general manager had already applied to appoint an administrator in the federal court. \nSeparate challenges will contest parallel laws at the state level, including in New South Wales. \nThe ACTU executive resolved to support the CFMEU going into administration, but blue-collar unions feel the ACTU\u2019s secretary, Sally McManus, and president, Michele O\u2019Neil, went further by supporting what Hicks labelled the \u201ccompletely unnecessary\u201d demand by the Albanese government for the union to consent to administrators or risk special legislation. \n\u201cFor them to support that proposition is untenable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe union movement fights for procedural fairness, the presumption of innocence and a fair go.\u201d \n\u201cSupporting the government position to put the CFMEU into administration without right to defend themselves [in the federal court] is unforgivable. \n\u201cThere are big questions about the ongoing leadership of McManus and O\u2019Neil with regards to their position, and why they wouldn\u2019t oppose this draconian, undemocratic legislation.\u201d \nThe comments come ahead of a meeting of the broader Communications Electrical Plumbing Union to debate the continuation of its ACTU affiliation. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nMcManus \u2013 who amid adverse reports about the construction union in July said she was not aware of alleged criminal infiltration \u2013 said on Wednesday that the ACTU had \u201curged the CFMEU to take action to rid themselves of criminal elements and for those accused to stand aside pending investigations\u201d. \n\u201cWhen they were unable to do this, we urged them to consent to administration to avoid legislation,\u201d she said. \n\u201cUnfortunately, they were also unable to do this.

The states, which have been holding out on reaching a deal amid calls for higher levels of commonwealth funding for public schools, will now have until September to agree to the proposed 2.5% federal increase, or keep the old agreement. The new agreement also ties school funding to targets \u2013 including Naplan results, attendance and graduation rates \u2013 but falls short of stating how or when all Australian schools will ever reach full funding levels.

But the federal education minister, Jason Clare, is still working with the remaining states to secure their agreement to his current offer of a 2.5% overall increase in commonwealth funding to public schools by 2029. State governments have maintained their opposition to the WA deal, banding together to demand a 5% commonwealth funding increase, citing budgetary pressures. Clare said there were no \u201cblank cheques\u201d on offer in the next agreement. \u201cI want to invest billions into our public schools and I want to make sure that money makes a difference to the kids who really need it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Northern Territory has signed up and Western Australia is expected to be the next to sign up.

It was expecting an $844m surplus in 2024-25. \n \n  Related: Housing to be at the centre of NSW budget, with more homes for those in need  \n \nThe government had been anticipating a $1.6bn surplus in 2025-26 but the budget it hands down on Tuesday will forecast a $2.5bn deficit. It had forecast a $1.5bn surplus in 2026-27 but is now predicting a $2.4bn deficit. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, has been setting the scene for another restrained budget and told the people of NSW not to expect anything splashy. \nAn excerpt of the speech Mookhey will deliver in parliament on Tuesday shows he will blame the redistribution of the goods and services tax for the state\u2019s financial woes. \nMookhey will describe the GST system as \u201cunfair\u201d and say that for every dollar that Victoria will give to the smaller states next year, NSW will give \u201cupwards of four\u201d and that it \u201cdeserves its fair share\u201d. \nHe will say the change to the GST carve-up will mean NSW is only getting back 87 cents of every dollar of GST it contributes to the federal pool of revenue generated by the tax, down from 92 cents. \nUnder the redistribution recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in March, all states and territories will receive more GST than last year, except for Queensland, which will receive $469m less and NSW, which will receive $310m less. \nThe grants commission explained Queensland and NSW were expected to increase their capacity to earn revenue, particularly because of coal royalties and soaring land values, and should therefore get less from the GST pool. \n \n  Related: From social housing to $1.5m for a studio: minister hits out at \u2018dud deal\u2019 sale of Sydney\u2019s Sirius building  \n \nMookhey has previously said the latest GST allocation would cost NSW $11.9bn and \u201calmost certainly\u201d result in the state losing its AAA credit rating. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nIn his speech on Tuesday, Mookhey will promise that the government will \u201cabsorb\u201d the lost revenue through \u201ccareful spending\u201d rather than \u201chitting families or businesses\u201d. \nOn Saturday Mookhey announced that land tax thresholds would be lifted for the 2024 financial year and then left steady without indexation for inflation. The \u201cmodest\u201d changes would generate $1.68bn over the next four years. Foreign investors would also be taxed more. \nThe move followed Victoria\u2019s budget last year that hit those owning a second home or investment property with additional land tax charges. Victorian landholdings worth more than $300,000 will pay a $975 fee plus 0.1% of the total land value.  \nHousing is expected to be at the centre of this year\u2019s budget. \nThe government will shell out $1.4bn over four years for new and upgraded schools for regional communities and $253m for planners to speed up the assessment of development applications, to deliver housing uplift and infill across Sydney. \nThe premier, Chris Minns, last month announced $200m for councils that meet and beat a fresh set of housing targets as part of the NSW government\u2019s push to build nearly 400,000 new homes over the next five years. \nThe government will also spend $66.9m to extend several early intervention and diversion programs for young people who are at risk of reoffending or committing crimes and $20m on a new case management IT system for youth justice workers. \nThis is in addition to a $26.2m package of youth crime initiatives which the government announced in March along with new laws that would make it harder for teenagers to get bail and criminalise \u201cposting and boasting\u201d about offences on social media. \nTuesday\u2019s budget is also expected to fund an emergency $230m domestic violence package. \n\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 18 June 2024.

During a first meeting of creditors on Friday administrators from the firm Hall Chadwick said \u201cwe\u2019re moving heaven and earth\u201d to secure a future for the grounded airline. The firm has been controlling Bonza since its planes were abruptly repossessed at the end of April. It has calculated that in addition to an almost $80m loan from its sole owners 777 Partners, the airline owes more than $20m to other creditors, including employees and customers.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Asked about support from governments, administrator Richard Albarran said discussions were occurring with the federal government on a daily basis. \u201cThe federal government have indicated at this point in time, this doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t change, but the federal government has indicated it\u2019s unlikely to be forthcoming in relation to any financial incentives,\u201d Albarran said. Guardian Australia understands that the federal government is not considering providing any financial assistance to Bonza or its administrators, and that it views it as the responsibility of the administrator to determine the best possible way forward. Albarran said in Queensland \u2013 home to Bonza\u2019s bases on the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast and many of its regional routes \u2013 the state government was \u201cconsidering its position\u201d. \u201c[An administrator] is speaking to them two to three times a day at the moment so hopefully there will be some assistance \u2026 They want to know what\u2019s the strategy for Bonza, who\u2019s the purchaser, so there\u2019s a few things that need to be dealt with, with them and a potential purchaser,\u201d Albarran said. However, the Queensland government later rejected this characterisation, with a spokesman for deputy premier Cameron Dick saying \u201cour position is the same as that of the federal government\u201d. Guardian Australia understands the support being considered relates to Bonza\u2019s staff, and not a financial contribution to help the foreign-owned airline.   Related: Grounded: Bonza poised to join long list of failed Australian airlines    Almost 60,000 out of pocket customers were eligible to attend the meeting on Friday, alongside the airline\u2019s trade creditors and 323 stood down employees. The administrators echoed earlier comments that Bonza\u2019s fleet of 737-Max 8 aircraft \u2013 four under its name and two lent from a Canadian carrier with ownership links \u2013 have had their leases terminated and that even those that remain at Australian airports are ultimately expected to be flown to North America. The aircraft were made available under leases 49% owned by Bonza\u2019s parent company, the US private investment firm 777 Partners. A reported breakdown in the relationship between 777 Partners and its financier, the US insurance giant Advantage Capital Holdings, known as A-Cap, led to a change in ownership structure of the leased aircraft last month. A new holding company owned by A-Cap, Phoenix Aviation Capital, took full ownership of the aircraft and subsequently issued orders to recall the planes from Australia. Administrators said that after talking with the lessors, they had accepted the planes would leave Australia, and that a grounding of operations and employee stand down orders set in place until the end of Tuesday 14 May would probably be extended. However, discussions have begun to source new aircraft leases within three months or sooner, as well as short term leasing options \u201cfor a more immediate solution\u201d in the interim. Amid a global shortage of planes and order backlogs, it\u2019s unclear what models of aircraft have been offered. There has been concern within the industry that Bonza\u2019s previous business model of relying on the 737-Max 8s supplied by 777 Partners for regional routes made profits tough without selling every seat on a flight. The Miami-based 777 Partners has reportedly been accused by lenders of fraud and double-pledging of assets that it didn\u2019t own, according to a lawsuit filed in New York last week.  Bonza\u2019s administrators issued a call out for anyone with more information on the dealings of 777 Partners to come forward. The administrators said there had been \u201ca number of very interested parties\u201d and that they were hopeful a transaction could happen. They said they would be cutting off expressions of interest for potential buyers over the weekend and would then update creditors on the potential shortlist. The questions about the financial situation of 777 Partners have triggered discussion within Australia\u2019s aviation industry as to whether Bonza\u2019s business plan had been sound, amid reports the airline had been close to a potential takeover from a local business figure prior to being blindsided by the aircraft repossessions. Most online participants at Friday\u2019s meeting were out-of-pocket passengers, asking questions about securing refunds, circumstances where travel insurance didn\u2019t cover their holiday expenses, issues with getting proof of purchase from the smartphone app Bonza required most to book through, as well as employees wanting to know about their future.", "Treasurer touts \u2018responsible\u2019 2024 NSW budget in tough economic times \u2013 but others will make that call [2024-06-18T05:28:11Z]": "The New South Wales treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, dubbed his second budget since Labor took government 15 months ago as \u201ca responsible [one] in difficult economic times\u201d. \nOthers will make that call, including credit raters Moody\u2019s and Fitch, which have maintained the state\u2019s triple-A assessment despite Australia\u2019s most populous state forecasting deficits \u2013 albeit shrinking ones \u2013 out to 2027-28 and possibly beyond. \nThe state, home to a third of Australia\u2019s economy, has been slugged by interest rates reaching 12-year highs. Median homes in Sydney cost $1.15m in May, or almost 50% more than Melbourne\u2019s, with mortgage loads of similarly outsized burden. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nMookhey declared he was \u201cnot spending callously\u201d in a way that might encourage the Reserve Bank to leave borrowing rates high (or lift them). \nThe Coalition\u2019s final budget, for 2022-23, proposed spending an extra $25bn over four years in a failed pre-election splurge. Counterparts in Queensland and Western Australia \u2013 where Labor governments both face polling days within 12 months \u2013 hope for more grateful electorates. \nMookhey\u2019s restraint, such as it is, might be time-limited. The government does not have to worry about re-election until its 2026-27 budget. \nStill, the NSW budget boasts $8.7bn in extra spending to assist households \u201cwith growing cost-of-living pressures\u201d that will be noted by the RBA. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe state\u2019s deficits over the four years also tally about $10bn. The blame is an adverse carve-up of GST that \u201cduds\u201d NSW to the tune of $11.9bn out to 2027-28 compared with last year\u2019s share, the treasurer keeps reminding all. \nMookhey, though, seemed resigned \u2013 if not nonchalant \u2013 that rating agencies would downgrade NSW, lifting borrowing costs in the process. (S&amp;P Global ditched the state from its top rating in 2021.) \nInterest charges are already forecast to rise 9.1% each year over the forward estimates, with the treasurer declining to say if that increase factored in any rating cuts. \nQueensland, he told journalists on Tuesday, had had a lower debt rating than NSW since 2009 but had been able to borrow more cheaply. \nThat happy outcome, though, probably hinges much on the brave move by the Palaszczuk government to rake in billions of dollars in windfall royalties from the coal sector when global prices spiked. \n \n  Related: NSW budget 2024: the biggest winners and losers   \n \nNSW missed its chance to snag as much as $2bn a month (when the Nationals apparently objected to the Liberals copying the northern neighbour). \nHigher royalties introduced by Mookhey in his first budget were forecast to bring NSW an extra $2.7bn over the four years to 2027 \u2013 a number bumped up by $500m in the current one. Helpful, but not a way to snap what could be a decade of deficits. \nCoal costs aren\u2019t small either. The cost of the commonwealth\u2019s coal price cap will near $900m over the 18 months to the end of this June, with the costs shared between the federal and state governments, officials told Guardian Australia. \nOrigin Energy, which in May secured a risk-sharing scheme with the government to keep the giant Eraring power plant spinning for at least a couple more years, was likely the biggest beneficiary of that price cap, given its short-term contract gamble. \nBudgets, of course, are only as good as their assumptions. For NSW, the fault lines may be whether Mookhey and the finance minister, Courtney Houssos, can restrain spending as they presently propose. \nAverage annual spending is projected to slow sharply from 5.1% a year in the nine years prior to Covid times to just 1.7%, the budget promises. \nThat forecast seems to be heroic, given the budget is predicting average annual employee expense (think wages, super and so on) will rise 3.2% over the four years. (Public employees have been offered a cumulative 10.5% rise over the next three years alone.) \nMookhey said total headcount in the public service would not change much over these years, with the wage increases funded by lopping a lot of executive bureaucrats. \n \n  Related: NSW state budget 2024: 30,000 new homes pledged amid \u2018unprecedented intervention in housing market\u2019  \n \nFor context, the budget assumes Sydney\u2019s consumer prices will rise by average of 2.7% each year. \nTo make the task of discipline even tougher, the budget also forecasts NSW wages after inflation will increase 2.7% in the five years to 2027-28. \nIn their first reaction to the budget, Moody\u2019s said NSW\u2019s \u201cweaker share\u201d of the national GST pool amid sustained capital spending \u201cwill challenge debt affordability\u201d. \nIt also noted that meeting the annual expenditure growth target \u201cwill be difficult to achieve because of persistent inflation pressures and the recent removal of the state\u2019s wage increase cap\u201d. Employee costs will average 43.7% of total operating expenditure over the four years. \nFor its part, S&amp;P Global said the budget \u201cshould support the creditworthiness of the state\u201d, which the agency rates as AA+. \u201cOperating surpluses are likely to grow in subsequent years, albeit at a slower pace than previously budgeted.\u201d \nBefore the March 2023 election, Labor pledged to cover higher public sector wages through increased productivity. Rating agencies and the RBA will be among those marking Mookhey\u2019s handiwork. \n\u2022 This article was amended on 18 June 2024. A previous version incorrectly reported the total cost of the coal price cap as $884m, with the federal government matching the contribution.

The package responds to recommendations of the rapid review of prevention approaches, which called for a \u201csignificant funding uplift\u201d in certain frontline areas. The national legal assistance partnership, due to expire in June next year, will be renewed after the Mundy review called for increased investment to reverse the \u201cneglect of Australia\u2019s legal assistance sector\u201d. But the plan could spark a new funding fight, with some states and territories objecting to co-funding a rollover of what was a predominantly commonwealth responsibility. There is some suggestion the commonwealth wants to present a $500m package, co-funded by the states, but that was still under consideration on Thursday.

I\u2019m confused how I got here too | Anonymous    Before the meeting the minister for finance and women, Katy Gallagher, said the federal government did not want \u201ca states versus the commonwealth kind of argy-bargy\u201d about funding, promising it would show leadership and be \u201cprepared to put some dollars on the table and we want to shift the dial here\u201d. Albanese said that national cabinet\u2019s aim of \u201cending family, domestic and sexual violence in a generation\u201d will require an \u201call-hands-on-deck approach\u201d. National cabinet will discuss measures to help young Australians who have experienced or been exposed to violence, and to monitor high-risk perpetrators, including New South Wales reforms to ensure people granted bail who are facing high-risk domestic violence charges are electronically monitored.

On Thursday Gallagher said although all governments needed to respond, Albanese has been \u201cleading this and shaping this\u201d because the commonwealth recognises that \u201cviolence against women \u2026 has such a terrible impact on our society\u201d. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll take a substantial package to national cabinet tomorrow for further investment in this area,\u201d she told Radio National. Albanese described the domestic violence situation as \u201ca national crisis\u201d. \u201cWe want all violence against women and children to stop, and we won\u2019t be satisfied until it stops,\u201d he said. Women\u2019s Legal Services Australia told the Mundy review that \u201c1,018 attempts to receive assistance were turned away during a 5-day period\u201d meaning an estimated 52,000 people, \u201cmany of whom are experiencing domestic, family, and sexual violence\u201d, were turned away each year. The rapid review noted \u201cthe dire need for crisis accommodation for victim-survivors, particularly in remote and regional communities, such as the Torres Strait, where [it] heard that there was only one shelter to service the entire region\u201d.   Related: Muslim groups to campaign on gambling and domestic violence in lead-up to Australian election    The review also recommended the establishment of nationally consistent travel assistance for people escaping family and domestic violence who live in remote areas. In addition to funding frontline services, the review called for a better approach to \u201cengaging with men and boys, and on healthy masculinities and violence prevention\u201d and improving men\u2019s behaviour change programs. The review pushed the federal government to abolish the activity test to improve access to childcare and adopt a total ban on gambling advertising. The Albanese government is planning only a partial ban on TV ads. In May Albanese announced $925m to help victims of violence leave abusive relationships and a ban on deepfake pornography after a special national cabinet meeting focusing on family and domestic violence.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries confirmed on Saturday that three red imported fire ant nests had been found in South Murwillumbah, 13km from the Queensland border in the state\u2019s north-east. \u201cThis is the first fire ant detection in northern NSW and presumed to be the most southern report of fire ants from the Queensland infestation,\u201d the department said.   Interactive   The Invasive Species Council has been warning a spread of red fire ants was possible from as early as August, prompting a call for the federal government to trigger an urgent review of the adequacy of fire ant eradication funding. The council\u2019s advocacy manager, Jack Gough, said a strategic review into their eradication, released in 2021 found that if the ants became established, the species would \u201csurpass the combined effects\u201d of Australia\u2019s worst wild pests, including rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats. \u201cFire ants can be lethal to humans and government modelling suggests they will have a $2bn per year impact on Australia\u2019s economy if they get out of control,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will devastate wildlife, cut agricultural output by up to 40% and may cause over 100,000 extra medical appointments each year.\u201d According to the Department of Primary Industries, red imported fire ants can damage electrical and agricultural equipment, sting people, pets and livestock, kill native plants and animals and damage ecosystems \u201cbeyond repair\u201d. The NSW government said it was working with the federal government, Queensland and Tweed shire council to chemically eradicate the infestation. Control efforts were focused on a 200-metre radius from the nest sites, with DPI officers and detection dogs working to determine the extent and origin of the infestation. A biosecurity control and tracing order had also been applied over a 5km radius, restricting businesses and residents from moving potential fire and carrier materials. Fines for breaching the order can reach up to $1.1m for an individual and up to $2.2m for a corporation.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The federal agriculture minister, Murray Watt, said the Queensland and NSW governments were working to eradicate the detection and monitor surrounding areas. \u201cThis is the first fire ant detection in northern NSW but not the first detection outside south-east Queensland, with isolated detections having previously been eradicated in Gladstone, the Port of Botany and the Port of Fremantle,\u201d he said. The NSW agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, said the state government had been prepared for the discovery of fire ants in northern NSW and had immediately implemented the response plan, part of an almost $600m national eradication program.   Related: Fire ants are planning to destroy Australia and not in a good way | First Dog on the Moon    \u201cFinding fire ants early and alerting NSW DPI, just like the community member has done in this instance, will increase our chances of a successful eradication effort,\u201d Moriarty said. But Gough said the program had cut eradication and surveillance on the ground in Queensland to half of what was needed, and contained no systematic action to stop a westward or northern spread of the ants. \u201cWhile eradication is still possible, this new infestation in NSW, when combined with huge recent increased costs of labour and materials due to inflation, means the ISC no longer have confidence the current proposed program funding is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are therefore calling on the Albanese government to trigger an urgent review of the adequacy of fire ant eradication funding and commit to topping up the funding on the basis of that review.\u201d The NSW Farmers Association warned the incursion posed a threat to agricultural production and the landscape of NSW, demonstrating the \u201curgent need\u201d for greater investment across governments to support biosecurity. . \u201cWe want red imported fire ants eradicated not only in New South Wales, but in Queensland where this incursion originated,\u201d it said. The NSW Nationals leader, Dugald Saunders, said it was a case of too little too late. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments so far is a complete lack of urgency, and it\u2019s taken the detection of these ants in NSW to trigger an eradication response,\u201d he said. A review of the national red imported fire ant eradication program warned all hopes would be \u201clost forever\u201d if the ant moved across the Queensland border into NSW. Biosecurity Queensland said it was working \u201chand in hand\u201d with NSW to contain and eradicate the fire ants, including the deployment of detection dogs and trained officers to destroy nests. \u201cThe program understands the confronting nature of the first detection of fire ants in northern NSW but urges the community and relevant agencies to work together to ensure they are eradicated,\u201d they said, adding that \u201csuccessful eradications of isolated infestations have been achieved\u201d.", "Budget cruising isn\u2019t dead \u2013 but the closure of P&O Cruises makes market sense [2024-06-08T00:00:30Z]": "News of P&amp;O Cruises Australia being wound up may have stung those with fond memories of the brand\u2019s uniquely Australian style of voyages. But experts say that although cruising remains popular, tastes are changing and new opportunities have appeared thanks to the widening of the Panama Canal. Announcing that P&amp;O Cruises Australia would be shut down in March 2025 and integrated into Carnival Cruise Line, owned by global ship operator Carnival Corporation, CEO Josh Weinstein said the decision was made because of the South Pacific\u2019s small population as well as \u201csignificantly higher operating and regulatory costs\u201d. The Australian market is a modest part of the operations for the world\u2019s biggest cruise company, US-listed Carnival, representing about 5% of its revenue.In 2023, the Australian division generated US$1.2bn in revenue, compared with US$13.1bn in the US, and US$6.6bn in Europe, according to Carnival\u2019s most recent annual report.   Related: P&amp;O Cruises Australia to shut down early next year     Because of the larger populations and profitability of the northern hemisphere market companies deploy most of their ships to the Mediterranean and Caribbean. However, demand in Australia remains strong. The local cruise line industry has recently roared back to life, with passenger numbers in the most recent season surpassing the pre-Covid era, a revival considered remarkable for a sector once synonymous with the outbreak of the deadly pandemic. Carnival\u2019s Australian division, which includes Cunard, Princess and Seabourn, is scheduled to make 846 domestic port calls in 2024, compared with 575 last year.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Meanwhile, Virgin global founder Sir Richard Branson visited Sydney in December to launch Virgin Voyages in Australia, which targets the adult, specifically singles, market. However, uncertainty about Middle East sea routes prompted the company to axe next year\u2019s Australian season. P&amp;O has a long history in Australia. The Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company, as it was once known, initially ran steamships from Europe to Australia, mostly carrying goods and immigrants rather than tourists.     \u201cP&amp;O is a heritage brand that predates Australia as a country; people arrived here by P&amp;O ship in 1852,\u201d says Chris Frame, a cruise ship historian and author of a recent book on the history of P&amp;O cruises. \u201cThis was a massive moment in Australia\u2019s history because it had taken quite some time for the colonies to get a steamship service to the continent,\u201d Frame says. \u201cP&amp;O became a huge part of the Australian immigration story; it\u2019s how so many people moved here to start a new life. And by the time the company launched a cruising service in the 1930s (a Sydney to Norfolk Island trip in 1932 that sold out in a single day) the brand was trusted, it had a place in the hearts of Australians,\u201d he says. Cruising really took off in the 1930s in Australia. A slump in international trade caused by the Great Depression meant ships could dock for longer and passengers travel at a more leisurely pace. \u201cThese cruise ships weren\u2019t like they are now; passengers used to form committees and organise their own fun to decide what activities they\u2019d do. You\u2019d see pictures of egg and spoon races on board,\u201d Frame says. Then, in the 1970s, after the emergence of jet planes, P&amp;O repositioned itself as a budget friendly party ship rather than primarily a form of transport.     \u201cThe real shift happened when P&amp;O bought Sitmar cruises and the Fairstar. [Fairstar] became the fun ship. She was cheap and cheerful and would do holidays to the South Pacific,\u201d Frame says. \u201cThere was no dress code, there was nothing to worry about on board, and that\u2019s where P&amp;O Australia got its current identity as being a really chilled out, Aussie experience.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to point to just one thing for P&amp;O\u2019s demise, says Pierre Benckendorff, a professor of tourism business at the University of Queensland. New entrants, the comparative affordability of flying overseas for holidays post-Covid, and the growing influence of retired baby boomers flush with cash and whose tastes have grown beyond budget cruising \u2013 are among the factors.    Related: Cruise bookings sail above pre-Covid numbers as industry employs aggressive pricing     Benckendorff says that of Carnival\u2019s 10 cruise brands \u2013 which range from high-end luxury to niche and budget options \u2013 the company\u2019s largest, Carnival Cruise Lines, has been booming post-Covid.  \u201cMore than anything, this is about how they want to position these brands, and it would be fair to say Carnival [Cruise Lines] has larger ships with higher capacity, and the brand is generating more profit than [it does] with P&amp;O. \u201cSome of the P&amp;O ships were starting to get quite old too, and as they\u2019re mostly smaller, it makes sense for the company to put their resources into the Carnival brand.\u201d The widening of the Panama Canal in 2016 also meant it made sense to absorb the P&amp;O business into Carnival\u2019s larger brand, with its bigger more modern ships.  Consolidating fleets and registering them in the Caribbean, instead of in the UK, is a significant cost saving for the companies, according to Dr Patricia Johnson, a senior lecturer at the University of Newcastle\u2019s business school. \u201cIt is only the widening of the Panama Canal that let loose these behemoth ships into the Pacific. Prior to that there was no way they could deploy their fleets from the Carribean to the Asia/Pacific without significant costs,\u201d Johnson says. Benckendorff says instead of sailing big ships around the bottom of South America to the Pacific for the southern hemisphere\u2019s summer season, they can now travel through the canal. Meanwhile, investment in new cruise ship facilities in Australia over the past decade means those larger ships can dock here, he says. Ultimately, P&amp;O\u2019s closure reflects Carnival Corporation\u2019s confidence in the strength of the Australian cruising market.  \u201cI would argue that the brand, as a cruise line, was becoming jaded as the ships aged, and the marketplace for cruises has become so competitive,\u201d Johnson says. A Carnival Australia spokesperson said \u201cthere will be a small number of jobs that are lost\u201d. However, experts have noted cruise lines have largely avoided employing large numbers of Australians as they\u2019ve sought to raise margins in recent years. Benckendorff previously told the Guardian that companies operating in international waters aren\u2019t subject to Australian minimum award wages; registering ships in places such as the Caribbean allows them to pay lower wages. Benckendorff says the Australian market has matured since the days of the Fairstar, shifting towards two key segments.  \u201cMost cruisers are either retired baby boomers looking for something to do with their money or they are families who get quite good value from a package that is all inclusive of food \u2013 it\u2019s competitively priced against staying at a five-star resort,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say budget cruising is dead but I think the market has shifted \u2026 Carnival wouldn\u2019t have made this decision if they didn\u2019t think they could fill the larger capacity ships.\u201d ", "Sweet potatoes to faster passports: things you might have missed among 7,200 pages of budget papers [2024-05-14T09:52:50Z]": "The 2024 federal budget was delivered to the nation\u2019s journalists in the form of 7,265 pages, including four main papers, 38 media releases, 20 portfolio budget statements and 12 portfolio budget supplements. \nIt is a dense, arduous reading experience \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to miss some things. \nYou know about the budget\u2019s tax cut promises, energy bill relief and new housing investments.

The Queensland government announced on Friday it would commit $46m to create the temporary stadium but requested the remaining $91m cost be shared between Brisbane city council, AFL and cricket authorities and the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland, which runs the annual Ekka show at the venue. The Palaszczuk government has committed to a $2.7bn rebuild of the Gabba to make it the centrepiece of the 2032 Olympic Games \u2013 but the expected four-year rebuild will leave the Brisbane Lions AFL team and Brisbane Heat T20 cricket franchise temporarily homeless from late 2025. Various venues have been canvassed as replacements, including the Lions\u2019 boutique stadium in Ipswich and that of their rivals the Suns on the Gold Coast. While Brisbane\u2019s Liberal National party lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, has lobbied for the showgrounds option as a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to keep teams playing in their home city, on Friday he said the work would not go ahead unless the Labor sport minister, Stirling Hinchliffe, came back to the table with more money. \u201cIt was the state government\u2019s decision to tear down the Gabba so it\u2019s the state government\u2019s responsibility to find the Brisbane Lions and Heat a temporary home,\u201d Schrinner said. The mayor said the government had previously included relocation costs and the need for a temporary venue in the Gabba rebuild project \u2013 and that it was now \u201cquite clear that they\u2019ve undercooked the funding\u201d. He said the council was \u201calways happy to discuss making a minor contribution\u201d but the project would not go ahead \u201cbased on this funding model\u201d. Hinchliffe said work would need to start next year for the venue to be ready for the 2025-26 cricket season and that Friday\u2019s funding announcement was intended \u201cto get the ball rolling\u201d. \u201cThis is the beginning of the negotiation that we need to have,\u201d he said. Once the AFL and cricket teams could return to the revamped Gabba, the showgrounds\u2019 main arena would be scaled back to a 12,000-seat bowl as an Olympic \u201clegacy\u201d project, the minister said. The Lions\u2019 chief executive officer, Greg Swann, said he was pleased the process of finding his side a home was \u201cfinally moving forward\u201d. But he described Friday\u2019s announcement as a \u201cstarting point\u201d. Swann said the displacement was a \u201cmajor upheaval\u201d for the club \u2013 and could come at a critical time for the Lions. After more than a decade in the wilderness, the men\u2019s team have re-established the Gabba as one of the most feared venues in the AFL under their coach, Chris Fagan \u2013 winning every game at their home venue last season, though they fell agonisingly short of a drought-breaking premiership. Many fans feel the temporary pain will be worth it to ultimately access what is being sold as an \u201camazing 21st century\u201d stadium. But a lifelong diehard, Roger Grattan, said the affair was bringing back painful memories of the early days of professional Aussie rules in Brisbane when the \u201cBad News Bears\u201d played out of the Gold Coast. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get a state-of-the-art stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, sadly for the Lions, they are going to become journeymen again.\u201d The RNA\u2019s chief executive, Brendan Christou, said his organisation would stump up $15m for a project which would restore its existing heritage grandstands and add a temporary grandstand. But while he said the showgrounds option would build \u201ca great legacy for future generations\u201d, the \u201cfunding shortfall\u201d would need \u201cto be resolved before the project could be a workable solution for the Gabba standby facility\u201d.", "Queensland police service sacks First Nations advisory group after members refuse to sign gag clause [2024-05-06T15:00:47Z]": "The Queensland police service has sacked a formal advisory group of First Nations community leaders and elders, six weeks after they refused to sign a gag clause that they say could have silenced ongoing criticism. Members of the QPS First Nations Advisory group have publicly and privately raised concerns that the police leadership had stalled on cultural reform promised in the aftermath of a 2022 inquiry. The group led calls for the resignation of the police union president, Ian Leavers, over a widely criticised October opinion piece on the state\u2019s proposed path to treaty that they condemned as \u201cracialised and divisive\u201d, containing \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d comments, including that a state treaty would result in the justice system favouring First Nations people\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  In 2022 members of the group accused Steve Gollschewski \u2013 now the Queensland police commissioner \u2013 of becoming angry and aggressive during a meeting with them, pointing his finger at a senior elder and saying \u201cyou people\u201d don\u2019t run the organisation. The group was notified of their sacking on 29 February \u2013 the day of former commissioner Katarina Carroll\u2019s farewell \u2013 after Gollschewski had been named as the acting commissioner. In a detailed statement, the group says that on 16 January, members were given contracts to sign containing confidentiality clauses. These clauses \u201cwould prevent us from speaking publicly about the work of the [group]\u201d and were contrary to the group\u2019s terms of reference, the statement says.   Related: Sex work decriminalised in Queensland after decades of campaigning    Two weeks later, the group met the new director of the police First Nations Division and raised concern about a number of matters, including stalled progress on implementing the inquiry\u2019s recommendations and \u201cconcerns our work is not being valued by the QPS\u201d. They have released a statement after attempting to raise concerns with the premier, Steven Miles. They say these efforts were \u201cmet with silence\u201d. \u201cWe are obliged to act with open transparency about the workings of the First Nations Advisory Group and we are obliged to advocate in the interests of justice for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe actions of the QPS have left us with little faith in the newly established First Nations division to be effective, or the senior leadership of the QPS to work in partnership with \u2026 our First Nations communities.   Related: Dangerous drivers to face prison sentences of up to 20 years under \u2018Susan\u2019s Law\u2019 in Queensland    \u201cWe are concerned that the QPS will now actively seek to recruit a token advisory group who will be bound by an approved narrative handed to them. \u201cUntil drastic action is taken to address the culture that exists within the QPS, we hold great concern that any action taken by QPS will be tokenistic, performative, and for the purposes of optics to mislead our communities\u201d. After taking concerns about Leavers\u2019s comments to Carroll, the group says the former commissioner agreed to undertake a \u201cracism audit\u201d of the QPS. Asked on Monday whether it had begun any racism audit, or if it intended to honour the commitment, the QPS did not address the question. In a statement, the QPS said it had conducted an \u201cinternal assessment\u201d of the advisory group, beginning in December, that \u201cidentified that the group, in its previous iteration, was not meeting the purpose and original intent of the group\u201d. \u201cWith that advice in mind, the executive director of the QPS\u2019s First Nation Division decided to release the group members at the time and encouraged those members to apply through a transparent recruitment process.\u201d \u201cThe QPS aims to recruit members with the view of reflecting the diverse groups that make up our First Nations community.\u201d Reference group members reject suggestions they were not fulfilling their objectives, under the co-designed terms of reference. They say they were not included in any review. Similar suggestions that the group was not representative \u2013 made by senior police during the inquiry in 2022 \u2013 were rejected at the time by members as a smokescreen for attempts to silence them. A former member of the group, academic Marlene Longbottom, raised concerns in 2022 that the QPS wanted to replace members agitating for reform with \u201cmore palatable blacks\u201d. \u201cThey want blackfellas who are not going to push the envelope, who are not going to call out the violence,\u201d she said. Longbottom resigned last year, saying meetings were \u201chostile\u201d and that she has \u201cno interest in working with [police] ever again\u201d.", "Future Made in Australia: what\u2019s in the $23bn package meant to create a \u2018renewable energy superpower\u2019 [2024-05-15T01:58:46Z]": "The federal government has been talking up its Future Made in Australia (FMIA) policy in recent months and more detail was revealed in Tuesday night\u2019s budget. Here\u2019s what we know so far.  What did we learn about FMIA in this year\u2019s budget?  A lot. A six-page \u201cfact sheet\u201d and \u201cglossy\u201d overview brochure laid bare the budget\u2019s intent to deliver \u201cCost of living help &amp; a future made in Australia\u201d. The ambition looks grand with $22.7bn earmarked over the next decade. Large chunks will be spent as production subsidies, such as $6.7bn for hydrogen produced with renewable energy and $7bn for refining and processing 31 critical minerals. That spending mimics the tax credits offered by the much larger Inflation Reduction Act ($A557bn and counting) in the US. Given their nascent state \u2013 particularly when it comes to green hydrogen \u2013 the spending will take a few years to ramp up. The opposition treasury spokesman, Angus Taylor, has also flagged the Coalition would axe the \u201cbillions to billionaires\u201d scheme if it gets the chance before the money flows. Budget paper No 1 justifies the government backing of private projects like this: \u201cIn certain circumstances, targeted public investment can strengthen the alignment of economic incentives with Australia\u2019s national interests and incentivise private investment at scale to develop priority industries.\u201d If Australia pulls it off, the country will \u201cbe an indispensable part of the global economy\u201d, another budget publication states. Presumably, these industries may fill the void if coal and gas exports diminish \u2013 as they must if the world gets serious about climate action. Some of the spending is \u201cenabling\u201d. There\u2019ll be a \u201cnew front door\u201d to streamline investment and planning approvals, that has been welcomed by groups such the Investor Group on Climate Change. A $1.7bn innovation fund, $134.2m to boost workers\u2019 skills and a 10-year extension of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency will also aid the country\u2019s ambition to become a \u201crenewable energy superpower\u201d. Also bundled into the mix is regional support such as the $519.1m Future Drought Fund over eight years. Perhaps that\u2019s a nod to the future of a more volatile global climate that as one of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel exports Australia has helped to make. What other projects are included in FMIA?  What counts as a FMIA project was not entirely clear before Tuesday\u2019s budget. For instance, the $15bn National Reconstruction Fund, which is yet to approve any projects, will be part of the \u201cwhole package\u201d even if not all of its seven priorities neatly fit the bill. The $1bn Solar Sunshot, announced in the Hunter at the end of March, counts as one, as does the $400m in loans to Alpha HPA to deliver \u201cAustralia\u2019s first high-purity alumina processing facility in Queensland\u201d. So, too, does the $185m earmarked for Renascor Resources to develop a graphite mine in South Australia\u2019s Eyre Peninsula. The $940m investment in PsiQuantum to \u201cbuild the world\u2019s first fault-tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane\u201d is the largest single FMIA foray. Others are not so clear. In April, Bowen dubbed the $330m for nine industrial projects as \u201censuring a future made in Australia\u201d, although that money came from the $1.9bn Powering Our Regions fund. The $2bn Hydrogen Headstart program, announced in last year\u2019s budget, has also been added to the mix. \u201cClean, cheap renewable hydrogen is a vital part of a future made in Australia,\u201d Bowen said this month. In case the public thinks FMIA is only about fighting climate change, the $1bn deal with Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall to build 100 Boxer weapon carriers for export was also counted. The pact was foreshadowed in July last year, well before FMIA emerged, and the 2024-25 budget lists $15.3m over seven years as the subsidy cost. When did we first hear about the policy?  A future made in Australia is hardly an unusual collection of words so it\u2019s not surprising Anthony Albanese used such a combination years ago. In January 2022, months before becoming prime minister, he visited the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. \u201cIn everything from infrastructure and manufacturing to energy and innovation, we will champion a future made in Australia,\u201d he said. The PM visited the Hunter again on 28 March this year to formally launch the policy, with its clear decarbonisation theme: \u201cI want a future made in Australia. And I want a future made in our regions. We have every metal and critical mineral necessary to be a central player in the net zero transformation and a proven track record as a reliable energy producer and exporter.\u201dThe policy got a fuller airing two weeks later at the Queensland Press Club, including the announcement of a Future Made in Australia Act \u201cto anchor this reform and secure this growth\u201d. \u201cWe will bring together in a comprehensive and coordinated way a whole package of new and existing initiatives,\u201d the PM said of the act. What is in the FMIA Act?  No one knows, as details of the bill aren\u2019t public yet and it looks unlikely to meet the government\u2019s original 1 July target date for passing parliament. Expect it to focus on making Australia a renewable energy superpower and at least process more of the country\u2019s resources so they don\u2019t exit these shores \u201craw\u201d. The net zero carbon transformation is one main organising theme, with economic resilience and security the other one. Australian workers and businesses are intended to be the beneficiaries, the government says \u2013 emphasising one or the other, depending on the audience. FMIA\u2019s wide-ranging scope means it won\u2019t sit within a single minister\u2019s portfolio. Instead, the PM will lead collaboration with the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, the industry minister, Ed Husic, and the resources minister, Madeleine King.", "Australian federal budget 2024: what we know so far and what to expect [2024-05-10T03:05:56Z]": "On 14 May the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will deliver his second full-year budget. \nChalmers has promised more cost-of-living relief in a budget that he says tackles inflation but sets Australia\u2019s economy up for growth \u2013 neither scorched-earth nor a free-for-all of spending. \n Here\u2019s what we know already about what is in the budget. \nTax cuts and cost of living \nThe biggest element of the cost-of-living relief in the budget is the changes to stage-three tax cuts, a $359bn 10-year tax cut package announced by Labor in January and legislated in February with opposition support. \nThe package means all Australian taxpayers (earning over the tax-free threshold of $18,200) get a tax cut, doubling the benefit for an average income earner compared with the Coalition\u2019s original stage three proposal. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nLabor says 84% of taxpayers are better off under its proposal, although those earning more than $146,486 would have received more under the Coalition\u2019s model. \nThere will be other cost-of-living measures the government claims won\u2019t add to inflation, which might point towards extending energy price relief. \nJim Chalmers has poured cold water on the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee\u2019s call for jobseeker to rise to 90% of the age pension, although he and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, have seemed more open on increasing rent assistance. Chalmers has confirmed there will be \u201cadditional steps\u201d on poverty reduction and \u201cnew initiatives for housing\u201d. \nEducation, skills and Hecs \nThe government will wipe $3bn from student debts by indexing Hecs and Help debts to the lower of the consumer price index or the wage price index, backdated to June 2023. \nThe government will also pay student teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers $320 a week during their mandatory work placements, starting from July 2025. These two measures are aspects of the government\u2019s response to the Universities Accord, but there will be more in the budget. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe government has announced $90.6m to boost the number of skilled workers in the construction and housing sector, creating 15,000 fee-free Tafe places and 5,000 places for pre-apprenticeships. \nSchool funding will also rise as the federal government negotiates with the states to cover the 5% funding gap, most recently offering to lift its share of funding from 20% to 22.5%. This is estimated to cost $6bn over five years, although Chalmers has been coy about whether estimates will be reflected in the budget or only be added after education and health agreements are finalised. \nChildcare \nThere is no question childcare workers will be receiving a pay rise in this budget \u2013 the only questions are how much and how it will be distributed. With the industry in crisis due to staffing shortages, which have been exacerbated by staff leaving to work in aged care after that sector\u2019s pay rise win, the government is expected to make wage increases for childcare workers a centre piece of the budget. \nBut it\u2019s unclear whether the government will pull the trigger on scrapping the activity test, which sets a subsidy rate based on employment. It has indicated it wants to get rid of the measure as part of its plan to make childcare in Australia \u201cuniversal\u201d, though it\u2019s not clear whether it will happen in this budget. \nHealth and aged care \nPublic hospitals are expected to get more funding, as the federal government works to finalise a new five-year agreement with the states to start in mid-2025. The commonwealth has reportedly offered to lift funding by an extra $4bn in 2025-26 and $13bn over the whole five years. \nThe government is also increasing funding for its medical research future fund over 13 years, with $1.1bn for existing projects plus $150m million to investigate rarely survived cancers, and $150m towards reducing inequalities in the health system. A further $500m will go to other research schemes. \nThe government is also yet to outline its response to March\u2019s aged care taskforce report, which suggested new ways to pay for the system \u2013 including asking Australians with more wealth to pay more for the cost of their care. \nThe health minister, Mark Butler, also announced $49.1m would go toward offering longer consultations of 45 minutes or longer for endometriosis sufferers. \nAmong a total of $15.4bn in \u201cunavoidable spending\u201d to continue programs from the previous government is money set aside for palliative care, cancer supports, public health chronic conditions, and alcohol and other drug treatments. \nDefence and foreign affairs \nThe budget will confirm that Australia\u2019s defence spending will increase from 2.1% of Australia\u2019s economic output next financial year to 2.4% by 2033-34, driven by a range of big-spending projects including the Aukus nuclear-powered submarines. \nThere will be some cuts to programs, however, with the government announcing last month that it would free up about $73bn over 10 years by cutting, delaying or changing the scope of some defence projects. \nEven after these cuts are taken into account, the government says it has committed a net increase of $50.3bn for defence over the next 10 years. This includes a net increase of $5.7bn over the immediate four-year budget cycle. \nThis immediate funding includes $1bn over the next four years for long-range strike, targeting and autonomous systems. \nIn foreign affairs, the government has promised $492m for the Asian Development Fund\u2019s 2025-28 pledging round, to \u201chelp respond to the needs of the region and deliver transformative development projects across the Indo-Pacific\u201d. \nInfrastructure \nSo far, western Sydney is the biggest winner in infrastructure after the minister, Catherine King, announced $1.9bn in funding for 14 road and transport projects. Those include road upgrades, planning projects and extra money for a business case to extend the train line into the city\u2019s south-west. \nCyclists will also get a boost with $100m being set aside to build and upgrade bicycle and walking lines in cities and regional centres. \nCanberra will also get a $50m injection to extend its light rail line from the northern suburbs past Parliament House and into the city\u2019s south.  \nThe nation\u2019s capital are getting a good deal because $249.7m has also been announced for Australian Institute of Sport as the 2032 Brisbane Olympics inches closer. \nThe quarter of a billion-dollar sum will go towards refreshing the ageing site with new accommodation, an all-weather sports dome and a new training centre. \nBeyond Canberra, road safety data from the states and territories will also be better harmonised with a $21m funding announcement to set up a national data hub.  \nFuture Made in Australia \nThe government has announced funding for a range of projects under its Future Made in Australia policy, which aims to directly support Australian industry and innovation, particularly in green energy. These commitments include: \n \n $1bn for the Solar Sunshot production of solar panels in the Hunter \n $1bn to PsiQuantum to build the world\u2019s first fault tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane \n $840m for Arafura\u2019s rare earth metals production in the Northern Territory \n An export agreement to sell armoured vehicles made by the German defence manufacturer Rheinmetall \n $566m over 10 years for GeoScience Australia to map what is under Australia\u2019s soil and seabed \n $400m in new loans to Alpha HPA for Australia\u2019s first high-purity alumina processing facility in Queensland; and \n $185m to Renascor Resources to fast-track the development of stage one of its Siviour Graphite Project in South Australia; and \n $100m to speed up environmental approvals, including assistance for business. \n \nGender equality \nThe government has committed $925m for the leaving violence payment, a payment of $5,000 to help meet the costs of leaving a relationship. The existing trial will be extended and the new permanent program available from mid-2025. \nThe government has also said that parents will receive 12% superannuation \u2013 or about $106 a week \u2013 on their publicly funded paid parental leave from July 2025, full costings for which will be in the budget. \nIndigenous affairs \nThe government has not foreshadowed any new major spending commitments in the Indigenous affairs space, but the budget will contain details and funding for several large programs in that portfolio that were recently unveiled. \nThe Closing The Gap commitments from February, including a $700m remote jobs program, and March\u2019s announcement of a $4bn remote housing program for the Northern Territory, are expected to be the major components of the Indigenous affairs portfolio. Most of the new commitments in Indigenous affairs are typically contained in February\u2019s Closing The Gap document rather than the May budget. \nAttorney General\u2019s Department \nThe government has pledged $161.3m to establish the national firearms register, and $11m for an app alerting Australians in real time if somebody tries to use their data to commit fraud. \nThe government will invest $166.4m to implement reforms to Australia\u2019s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime.", "Morning Mail: budget\u2019s $9.3bn surplus, BHP\u2019s $65bn raid rejected, Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer takes the stand [2024-05-13T20:59:30Z]": "Morning everyone.

The policy would reduce the intake of mostly skilled workers and recipients of family visas by a cumulative total of 150,000 over four years. \n\u201cWe believe that by rebalancing the migration program and taking decisive action on the housing crisis, the Coalition would free up more than 100,000 additional homes over the next five years,\u201d he said. \nDutton promised to ensure there were \u201cenough skilled and temporary skilled visas\u201d for construction workers and to \u201creturn the refugee and humanitarian program planning level to 13,750\u201d, a cut of one-third from the current 20,000. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nDutton said the Coalition would also \u201cimplement a two-year ban on foreign investors and temporary residents purchasing existing homes in Australia\u201d. \nAfter Labor committed to a cap on international student numbers, Dutton approved the measure and promised to add \u201ca tiered approach to increasing the student visa application fee\u201d including slugging students who change providers to \u201cenhance the integrity of the student visa program\u201d. \nIn the wake of the Bondi Junction stabbing and Wakeley church attack, Dutton signalled a push to \u201climit and restrict the sale and possession of knives to minors and dangerous individuals\u201d. \nDutton also promised to lead a push for states and territories to develop uniform knife laws, giving police the powers to stop and search people using detector wands, known as Jack\u2019s Law in Queensland. \nUnder the new proposed new offence of posting criminal acts online, people convicted would be banned from using digital platforms and liable for up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. \nDutton noted Labor\u2019s trial of age verification technology for minors accessing pornography but promised to \u201cinclude social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok in such a trial\u201d. \nAfter the Coalition waved through Labor\u2019s changes to the stage-three tax cuts, Dutton recommitted to \u201cprovide lower, simpler and fairer taxes for all\u201d but provided no detail, saying this would come \u201cahead of the election\u201d. \nSimilarly for nuclear power, Dutton said Australia should be \u201cfollowing the other top 20 economies in the world which have zero-emission nuclear power in their energy mix, or are taking steps to put it in\u201d, without saying how. \nDutton also committed to \u201cramping-up domestic gas production for affordable and reliable energy in the more immediate term\u201d, deriding \u201cLabor\u2019s new gas strategy [as] just words on paper\u201d. \nThe Coalition had already signalled it would support Labor\u2019s cost-of-living measures including the $300 electricity rebate. \nIn the budget reply, Dutton confirmed it would seek to save $13.7bn over 10 years by rejecting \u201ccorporate welfare for green hydrogen and critical minerals\u201d in Labor\u2019s Future Made in Australia plan. \nAfter months of his shadow minister complaining about Centrelink wait times and backlogs, the only other major saving identified by Dutton was to modify Labor\u2019s plan for \u201can additional 36,000 public servants\u201d costing billions over four years, a recruitment drive that includes $1.8bn for frontline Services Australia staff. \n\u201cThe Coalition sees areas like defence as much more of a priority than office staff in Canberra given the precarious times in which we live and threats in our region,\u201d he said, promising to \u201creprioritise Canberra-centric funding and make an additional investment in defence\u201d. \nDutton promised to reverse Labor industrial relations policies, but specified only the definition of casual employees. \nDutton promised to further increase the amount older Australians and veterans can work without reducing pension payments, estimated to affect 150,000 people. \n\u201cWe will double the existing work bonus from $300 per fortnight to $600,\u201d he said. \nDutton said the Coalition would increase the value of assets eligible for the instant asset write-off to $30,000 and \u201cmake this ongoing for small businesses\u201d. \nDutton also promised $400m for junior doctors who train in general practice with incentive payments, assistance with leave entitlements, and support for pre-vocational training. \nThe education minister, Jason Clare, told reporters in Canberra that Dutton \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts to tell people\u201d where he would put nuclear reactors and how much they would cost. \n\u201cThe real message out of that speech is: don\u2019t trust Dutton. If he\u2019s the person who broke the migration system, why would you trust him to fix it?\u201d", "Queensland budget 2023: coal royalty boom funds $550 energy rebate, free kindergarten and a record surplus [2023-06-13T05:33:36Z]": "The Queensland government\u2019s controversial decision to increase royalties on record-high coal prices has contributed to an unexpected $10bn revenue windfall and a record surplus, allowing the state to fund cost-of-living relief, including free kindergarten classes and $550 electricity rebates for all households. The treasurer, Cameron Dick, on Tuesday handed down Queensland\u2019s 2023-24 budget, which offered a rare opportunity for a government to pitch itself to economic conservatives \u2013 via a record surplus and debt reduction \u2013 while at the same time spending big on households struggling with inflationary pressures. At the heart of this year\u2019s budget is the increased revenue generated by coal royalty hikes \u2013 a measure announced last year that has faced significant opposition from the mining sector, including a $40m advertising campaign by the Queensland Resources Council. The budget papers reveal income of more than $15bn from coal royalties in 2022-23 \u2013 about $10bn more than had been forecast 12 months ago \u2013 due mainly to sustained high coal prices, which trigger the increased royalty rates. The boost has allowed the government to frame its 2023-24 budget as a Robin Hood-style affair \u2013 portraying miners as greedy for complaining while they rake in super profits, while marking the budget papers with a \u201ctackling the cost of living\u201d stamp.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWe can deliver our state\u2019s biggest cost-of-living program, our state\u2019s biggest building program and deliver lower debt for one simple reason \u2013 progressive coal royalties,\u201d Dick said. \u201cOur decision to take on the mining lobby, to stand our ground and to fight for the people of our state has delivered a rich reward.\u201d The increased royalties income are set to push the 2022-23 surplus to $12.3bn, which Dick said was the largest recorded by a state or territory government. The budget predicts Queensland will run a $2.2bn deficit next year, largely due to one-off spending measures. Coal royalties also helped the state temporarily reduce net debt, which is now $5.9bn, instead of the $19.8bn forecast 12 months ago. By 2026-27, debt levels will have climbed back to almost $47bn, largely due to infrastructure spending. Queensland will spend $8.2bn in 2023-24 on cost-of-living relief, including a $550 energy rebate for every household, with concession holders to receive an additional $150 discount on top of an existing $372 rebate, taking total support for this group to $1,072 in 2023-24. Dick said the rebate was the most generous of all the states and territories and meant many Queenslanders won\u2019t pay for electricity at all next year. He said the rebates were a deliberate measure to assist households in a way that is deflationary, rather than putting cash directly into people\u2019s pockets and potentially contributing to further inflation. The government has also announced it will fully subsidise 15 hours a week of kindergarten (in Queensland kindy is the year before children start school). The measure is expected to save Queenslanders up to $4,600 a year in fees. \u201cIt gives more Queenslanders the opportunity to return to work or to take on more work,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWe understand the economic potential that is unlocked by enabling more women to get back into the workforce.\u201d   Related: Guardian Essential poll: voters trust Labor over Coalition to manage cost of living and inflation    Dick also boasted a record $89bn will be invested in the state\u2019s \u201cbig build\u201d program over the next four years. The program will help provide critical infrastructure across the state ahead of the 2032 Olympic Games. Those measures come on top of increased funding for health, housing and youth justice \u2013 all areas where the state government has found itself under political pressure in recent months. Almost $2.9bn extra will be spent on health services over the next five years, including measures to reduce ambulance ramping and boost the state\u2019s patient travel subsidy scheme. The government will increase funding for social and affordable housing to $1.1bn, with $250m slated for housing and homelessness support services. Youth crime is another focus of this year\u2019s budget. The government has allocated $440m over five years for youth co-responder teams, policing and to help seniors secure their homes. \u201cThis budget delivers what the people of Queensland need: comprehensive cost-of-living relief,\u201d Dick said. \u201cNo other government in Australia could promise this. And no other government in Australia could deliver what this budget delivers for Queensland.\u201d The opposition Liberal National party said the budget failed to deliver long-term solutions to the cost-of-living, youth crime, health and housing crises. Shadow treasurer David Janetzki said Queensland would have \u201cnothing to show\u201d for the billions of dollars more than was previously forecast. \u201cAfter the rivers of gold dry up, Queensland will have nothing to show but the highest debt in our state\u2019s history, the highest taxes and failing frontline services,\u201d Janetzki said. The Queensland Resources Council chief executive, Ian Macfarlane, said the budget \u201crevealed the true extent in which Queensland relies on the resources sector\u201d. But the former federal Liberal resources minister said investor confidence had been \u201cshattered\u201d by the coal royalty increase and it would be an \u201cenormous hit on the future viability\u201d of the industry. The Queensland Council of Social Service chief executive, Aimee McVeigh, welcomed rebates on power that would benefit all Queensland households and that would likely see some low-income households not pay electricity bills at all for the next financial year. \u201cPeople have been not turning on heaters, not turning on lights and not using power because of the pressure that the cost of energy is putting on household budgets,\u201d she said.", "Queensland Labor\u2019s lurch to the right on youth justice shows a government that\u2019s lost principles and perspective  [2024-05-01T05:14:02Z]": "Late on Tuesday night, the Queensland government called youth organisations and other social service providers to parliament house for a confidential briefing about changes to the Youth Justice Act. Four senior ministers \u2013 including the premier, Steven Miles - walked through the doors. Attendees describe what happened next as \u201clike an ambush\u201d. Multiple sources say the ministers justified the changes \u2013 to erase the human rights principle of \u201cdetention as a last resort\u201d for children \u2013 as necessary to stop ongoing political attacks by the Liberal National party.   Related: Queensland Labor to remove principle of detention as last resort from Youth Justice Act    There it is. The quiet part out loud. Confirmation to many of those present that this is not just a government on life support; it\u2019s a government that has lost all perspective, deluded in the belief that \u2013 by borrowing the hardcore policies of its opponent \u2013 it remains somehow a more palatable choice. What Miles and Labor have inadvertently proved, again, is that the party is willing to abandon long-held principles and evidence-based policy in the face of an election defeat. In 2019, the youth justice minister, Di Farmer, told the state parliament she knew that if the state took a punitive approach to young offenders, there was an \u201calmost 100% chance\u201d they would reoffend. Months later, with the 2020 election on the horizon, the government changed bail laws to introduce a presumption against bail for some children. The flow-on impact was more children in youth detention and police watch houses, where conditions have worsened.   Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Farmer\u2019s prediction came true: experts say many of the youth justice issues in communities are because children in custody are offered little schooling or rehabilitation and inevitably reoffend. Labor politicians repeatedly rubbished the LNP\u2019s policy to introduce an offence for \u201cbreach of bail\u201d. Then they suspended the Human Rights Act and adopted the policy. In Cabinet last year, the police minister, Mark Ryan, walked in with a powerpoint and argued that the changes were needed to stop political attacks by the LNP. \u201cEvery news story about another incident would come with a line from the LNP saying the solution was [for] breach of bail [to be made an offence for children],\u201d a Labor minister said at the time. \u201cNow [if the LNP campaigns on youth crime at the election] we can turn around and say, \u2018well, we did what you wanted us to do\u2019.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t work. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, turned his attention to the idea of \u201cdetention as a last resort\u201d. He talks about it on an almost daily basis, particularly in regional cities like Townsville and Cairns. Earlier this year, Miles was defiant about the need to use detention only as a last resort for children. He said: \u201cAll of the evidence suggests that if you detain offenders for low-level offences you expose them to hardened criminals, you expose them to gangs, you make it much more likely they will reoffend. \u201cBut that LNP policy is incredibly dangerous... you\u2019d actually make the situation worse,\u201d Miles said.  It\u2019s now Labor policy, too. Labor sources say the youth crime debate has become so constant and damaging that the party desperately needed some clear air to sell other policies. There\u2019s a belief that Crisafulli is walking into office with no detail or substance behind his attack lines. \u201cWe need to get back to fighting on other issues,\u201d one MP said. \u201cWe can\u2019t win an election on youth crime. We just need to move on\u201d. Last month, a \u201cbipartisan\u201d committee looking at youth justice policy collapsed. Establishing the committee in the first place was a government strategy to attempt to neutralise the youth crime issue.  The logic of then premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was to establish a sort of war cabinet, adopt its recommendations and move on with a suite of policies endorsed by the LNP. But six months before the state election \u2013 and to no one\u2019s shock \u2013 the major parties couldn\u2019t agree on a way forward and the committee disbanded.  The idea that the LNP will simply take its win and move on to other issues defies logic.   Related: Queensland\u2019s $1.28bn community safety plan includes transporting detained children for schooling    Meanwhile, there are real-world consequences to any decision that has the impact of putting more children into custody. The number of children in adult police watch houses \u2013 where they are being held for weeks on end due to overcrowding in detention \u2013 are higher than ever. In February a 13-year-old boy was allegedly sexually assaulted in the Cairns watch house by an older, larger boy. Police admit they \u201ccannot meet\u201d expectations for young people while also dealing with adult prisoners. Psychologists have warned of incidents and deteriorating mental health conditions. The youth justice minister knows it to be true. She said herself; these children are almost certain to reoffend. The premier knows it to be true. He said it himself; children detained for low-level offences are more likely to reoffend. Every lurch to the right on youth justice just makes our communities less safe. The irony is inescapable. On Wednesday, morning, as the police minister introduced the bill, some year 6 children from a Brisbane state school walked into the legislative assembly chamber to watch the proceedings. As is customary, MPs smiled up at the kids and waved. Then got on with the job of passing legislation that will put more kids their age \u2013 11 and 12 \u2013 behind bars.", "Show of strength: NRL suburban ground funding a flex of new political might | Nick Tedeschi [2024-06-15T04:23:42Z]": "The announcement that three levels of government are combining to provide $40m of funding to upgrade Leichhardt Oval in Sydney is not only a major win for the NRL, but a flex of political muscle from a game that is now realising its own might. Rugby league has long been one of the two most popular sporting codes, along with Australian rules football, but when it came to exercising political power it was the AFL out in front and then daylight. Even rugby union \u2013 by any measure less popular, culturally relevant, and capable of drawing money \u2013 outstripped its rival rugby code in currying political favour. It was not until Peter V\u2019landys took charge of the Australian Rugby League Commission that the code became a serious political player. The Leichhardt Oval funding shows how far the game has come.   Related: Sydney\u2019s Leichhardt Oval gets $40m to revive what locals call \u2018the eighth wonder of the world\u2019    Winning government funding to upgrade any stadium is no easy task but it is particularly difficult for a suburban ground that will never be able to offer the comforts \u2013 and match-day revenue \u2013 of major stadiums. The new Allianz Stadium is an outstanding asset for Sydney, near the CBD with everything you might expect from a stadium in 2024. The food options are plentiful, viewing lines wonderful and corporate hospitality first-class. Allianz Stadium is a modern-day facility for all sports played on rectangular fields as well as sizeable concerts. While there was controversy around how much money the NSW Government put into the knockdown and rebuild, it was arguably necessary for a global city that has an engrained sporting culture and plays host to 15 men\u2019s professional football teams. An upgrade to Leichhardt Oval offers none of this. While the venue has been shaped as a new home for women\u2019s sport in Sydney, and it has long been used for school sport in the district, Leichhardt Oval is essentially for a single NRL club, Wests Tigers, that will host six men\u2019s matches a year. It also happens to be a ground located in a safe Labor federal seat, although the Greens have held the relevant seat at state level since 2011.    The funding is a testament to how the NRL now asserts its political clout. It was not long ago that NSW Premier Chris Minns said the state government would not fund any upgrades for Leichhardt Oval. While he was much more diplomatic in his approach, his message was essentially that the government would not fund putting lipstick on a pig. He claimed fiscal frugality but it was as much about the lack of political capital than anything. But the Minns government is now contributing $10m to the project. The NRL traverses a unique and difficult-to-navigate path when it comes to suburban grounds. Most major sports across the globe have moved away from them. The AFL has long played all Melbourne games out of just two venues - and has the crowds to justify it. The NRL, in Sydney, has long tried to straddle the need to play at both major stadiums and suburban grounds. Fans of teams that host games at suburban grounds tend to be incredibly attached to the venues. There is a strong nostalgia kick even if that has its limits. Leichhardt Oval has been an extraordinarily popular venue among the Tigers faithful but the facilities are not what one would expect for a professional sports facility. Charm only goes so far. New Wests Tigers CEO Shane Richardson was very much a driving force behind the push for a Leichhardt Oval upgrade. He was not short in support from political heavyweight V\u2019landys, who cut a deal with the Dominic Perrottet government to support the upgrade of a number of suburban grounds following the decision to abandon an overhaul of Accor Stadium. Richardson threatened - and it would not have been a hollow one - that the Tigers could no longer afford to play at Leichhardt Oval without the improvements. A lot of work has been done over the last decade to make NRL clubs profitable entitiesand there will be little sympathy from head office if they are not.   Related: Wallabies star Carter Gordon turns back on rugby union and joins NRL\u2019s Titans    The NRL can not and should not give up on suburban grounds. There is a certain charm in going to Brookvale, Leichhardt, Belmore or Shark Park that gives the NRL a far bigger community feel than other major sports. While the NRL should not play finals and other games that will attract bigger crowds than the grounds can hold there. The suburban grounds should be used to keep the positive nostalgia and create atmosphere for low-drawing games while not capping growth or profitability. Winning government support though, particularly in a safe political seat, is no easy task. V\u2019landys, through sheer force of will and his close relationship with a Prime Minister who loves rugby league, has been able to pull it off, in a major win to the game and its fans.  This article was amended on 15 June 2024. An earlier version said that Leichhardt Oval is located in state and federal electorates held by Labor. The Greens hold the relevant state seat of Balmain, while Labor hold the federal seat of Grayndler. ", "Scrap stage-three tax cuts to fight inflation rather than cut infrastructure funding, Queensland says [2023-11-06T23:40:01Z]": "The Queensland deputy premier has demanded that federal Labor explain why it is cutting infrastructure spending to fight inflation rather than revisiting controversial tax cuts for high income earners. Steven Miles has upped the pressure on the Albanese government over looming infrastructure cuts in an opinion piece in the Courier-Mail, arguing it is \u201ctoo late\u201d to cut projects to fight inflation and urging it to reconsider stage-three tax cuts instead. On Monday the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, confirmed that some of the 250 projects that have not begun construction in the $120bn infrastructure pipeline will need to be cancelled or delayed to pay for at least $33bn in cost overruns.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Last week the International Monetary Fund warned that a spending boom on infrastructure projects, mainly from the states, was a major factor pushing Australia\u2019s economy beyond full capacity and fuelling inflation. But Miles argued that \u201cinflation got out of control late in 2021 \u2013 before the last federal election\u201d. \u201cObviously, all government spending contributes to demand in the economy,\u201d he wrote.   Related: Infrastructure projects face axe amid $33bn in cost blowouts, Catherine King says    \u201cThat makes it incumbent on the Australian government to justify why funding earmarked for infrastructure should be prioritised for cuts, as opposed funding allocated to other priorities \u2013 tax cuts for wealthy households, for example.\u201d The stage-three tax cuts, passed by the Morrison government in mid-2019, begin in July 2024. They remove the $120,000 to $180,000 tax bracket, increase the top tax bracket to $200,000 and reduce the marginal rate of tax for everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 to 30%. The Greens and crossbench have urged Labor to reconsider the stage-three tax cuts, which will reduce tax revenue by $320bn over 10 years, citing the fact that the greatest benefit flows to high-income earners. The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has insisted there is no change to Labor\u2019s plan to leave the tax cuts in place, arguing that they help return bracket creep as income earners face higher rates of tax as they move into higher tax brackets. Miles argued that investment in \u201cproductivity-enhancing infrastructure is likely to reduce pressure on inflation in the longer term\u201d. \u201cWhen comparing options for budget austerity, the problem with looking to infrastructure is you can\u2019t cut projects already under construction, only future projects. \u201cSo any effect on total demand is likely to be years down the track, to be followed by a negative effect on productivity.\u201d Miles said this was \u201cespecially true\u201d of Queensland, experiencing \u201cextraordinary population growth\u201d in part due to what he called the federal government\u2019s \u201cplans to massively expand immigration\u201d. The Albanese government has only increased the permanent migration intake by 35,000 to 195,000 \u2013 but Australia has experienced a surge in net overseas migration due to borders reopening after Covid restrictions were eased. Queensland has been lobbying the federal government for permanent 50:50 funding for the Bruce Highway, a major national road which connects the south-east with the regions, and heavy rail for the Sunshine Coast. The Morrison government undercommitted funding for the heavy rail project and the Albanese government has pushed back against filling in overrun funding gaps, leading to a standoff with the Queensland government. On Monday King committed to continue building 300 projects that are under construction but said a further 250 faced cancellation or delay as a result of the infrastructure review to be released \u201cshortly\u201d. King said the federal government was \u201cin negotiations\u201d with the states, welcoming their help in cleaning up the \u201cmess\u201d left by the Morrison government. She refused to rule out cuts in particular states, noting \u201cthe entire pipeline has not been managed well by the previous government\u201d.

New peers, new teachers, new surroundings. What she didn\u2019t expect was classrooms with sagging roofs and holes in the walls, bathrooms filled with black mould, broken air conditioners and rusty desks. \u201cMost students at Tagai state college have only ever gone to schools in the Torres Strait, and have nothing to compare school facility standards to,\u201d the year 8 student representative says. \u201cBut I do, and I know these facilities are disgraceful.\u201d   Related: Five private schools spent as much on new facilities in one year as 3,000 Australian public schools    New research from the Australian Education Union, provided exclusively to Guardian Australia, shows there has been a significant decline in the adequacy of public school facilities in the four years to 2024, with principals citing degrading bathrooms, school halls and science spaces as their biggest concerns. The 2024 State of Our Schools survey, which canvassed more than 13,000 educators, found 19% of principals said they didn\u2019t have enough classrooms at their schools and 40% said they wouldn\u2019t have sufficient space to meet enrolments in the next three to five years. On average, an additional 4.6 classrooms were required for each school \u2013 equating to 12,503 across the country.    The findings have prompted calls for the federal government to restart infrastructure funding for public schools, which was temporarily introduced by the Albanese government in the 2023 budget and is set to expire. The one-year upgrade fund spread $215m across thousands of public schools, with the onus remaining on states and territories to maintain campuses.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Non-government schools have been allocated $1.37bn since 2017 in commonwealth funds as part of a capital grants program. If the scheme remains in place, data revealed at Senate estimates forecasted that private schools would receive an additional $732.7m in federal government funds to 2027. Before the last federal election, Labor said the standard of school campuses and facilities was a \u201cclear indication of the deep inequities between Australian school systems\u201d. But since then those inequities have continued to widen.    In 2022 private schools spent more than double the amount public schools did per student on buildings and infrastructure, rising to an all-time high of $3,285 a student. At the same time capital expenditure in public schools per student decreased to $1,576. The AEU estimates the total investment needed to rectify the gap over the decade from 2013 to 2022 is $35bn, or $4.4bn in 2022 alone. Its federal president, Correna Haythorpe, is urging the commonwealth to commit to a permanent capital fund for public schools, plus a one off \u201cnation-building investment\u201d of $1.25bn. \u201cThe Turnbull government stopped capital funding for public schools in 2017 and the Albanese government only brought it back for one year,\u201d she says. \u201cPrivate schools are set to get $1bn more in capital funding from the federal government over the next four years, and $2.7bn more over a decade, while public schools will get nothing, unless the prime minister steps in. \u201cIt is through the quality of school facilities that we can send a powerful message to children that their education matters, that we value them and will provide each of them with a learning environment that helps them succeed.\u201d   Related: Parents fear children are being sent back to asbestos-riddled classrooms at Queensland school    The federal minister for education, Jason Clare, said the government had delivered urgent funding for public school infrastructure projects, including $3.2m to Tagai state college this year. \u201cAfter almost a decade of Liberal neglect to public school infrastructure, the Albanese government has invested more than $200m in funding to improve public school infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cI want public education to be the first choice for parents. As a proud product of public education, I know how important it is.\u201d At Tagai \u2013 which operates across 17 campuses on fifteen different islands \u2013 just $8.5m was accrued in capital expenditure in the three years to 2023. The vast majority \u2013 $7.9m \u2013 came from the state government. The sprawling campus, which educates more than 1,000 students, is the most remote school in Queensland and the only secondary option for residents of the Torres Strait, unless they\u2019re willing to board on the mainland. About 96% of the students are Indigenous and 65% are in the bottom quarter of socio-educational advantage. Students perform well below their counterparts in Naplan across all categories, and just three in 10 attend class more than 90% of the time. In comparison, prestigious schools in Queensland, such as Brisbane girls grammar, Kelvin Grove state college, Kings Christian college and Southport, accumulated more than $30m apiece in capital expenditure in the same time period. Kings Christian college had the highest sum of $49.8m, with $9.6m contributed from the state government and $200,000 from the commonwealth. The rest came from private sources and new school loans. A spokesperson for Queensland\u2019s Department of Education said it had been working with the department of planning to improve the maintenance of remote schools, including Tagai. \u201cThe department \u2026 have commenced infrastructure improvements at the Thursday Island campus \u2026 and work is progressing,\u201d they said, adding it had also allocated funding from the latest budget to refurbish the school, with a contract expected to be awarded in term four.    \u201cMould remediation work is also underway across various spaces across the secondary campus. Other rectification work, such as roof replacements, have been completed, are underway or are slated to begin shortly.\u201d Paton loves her teachers but she says paying attention in grossly inadequate facilities is almost impossible. Acoustics are poor, making it hard to hear, the technology lags and when the air conditioner is broken, children sweat through extreme heat. She says the community feels sidelined because they\u2019re remote \u2013 out of sight and out of mind. \u201cIf these kind of facilities were on mainland Australia, there would be community outrage and parents demanding to speak with the principal,\u201d Paton says. \u201cJust because this is school is in very remote Australia does not make these standards tolerable \u2026 these facilities are actively disadvantaging us.\u201d", "Drought funding should focus on programs with \u2018lasting public benefit\u2019, review finds [2023-09-26T15:00:35Z]": "The Productivity Commission has recommended a major overhaul of the Coalition\u2019s $5bn Future Drought Fund to focus on programs that have a \u201clasting public benefit\u201d even if that means fewer funding announcements. The fund, established at the height of the 2019 drought, was designed to provide $100m in annual funding to build regional resilience and prepare farmers for drought. So far, it has spent $65m in 2020-21, $72m in 2021-22 and $92m in 2022-23. The federal government commissioned the review of part three of the Future Drought Fund Act eight months ago to assess the effectiveness of the fund to support drought resilience activities.   Related: Parts of Australia suffer drought and low rainfall as La Ni\u00f1a and climate change create weather extremes    The review said that while the Future Drought Fund (FDF) was a \u201csolid foundation for drought resilience\u201d, it concluded there was a need for greater planning and more targeted programs to deliver long term transformational change and wider community benefits. \u201cOver time, it might be expected that there will be a shift in the types of activities undertaken through the fund,\u201d the review said. \u201cFor example, there may be greater specialisation in a smaller range of activities in areas where the fund is best able to generate enduring positive change. The result may be even fewer programs.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter  It found there needed to be \u201ca stronger focus on activities that generate lasting public benefits\u201d. \u201cThe FDF should focus on activities that generate transformational change, build natural capital, and support a place-based approach to building social resilience,\u201d it said. It recommended rewriting the aim of the fund to focus on public benefits and climate change resilience, cutting back the farm business resilience program by tightening eligibility requirements, and streamlining two climate tools that were established to provide projections, economic analysis and advice on best practice into one service. \u201cThe Commission considers that the Australian Government should confirm that the FDF will only invest in drought resilience activities that are plausibly expected to lead to the Australian community being better off overall,\u201d the report said. It also recommended the removal of the legislated advisory role of the Regional Investment Corporation, dubbed \u201cthe Barnaby Bank\u201d, to the FDF. While the Productivity Commission report acknowledged some government drought support was appropriate, it said that taxpayer funds must show public benefit and promote changes that would not otherwise have been made. It was critical of the fund\u2019s aim that implied any activity that contributes to economic, social and environmental resilience in drought is a public good and could merit government funding. \u201cThis overlooks the fact that government resilience interventions also have costs, which can often fall to other sectors of the economy, and that many interventions offer benefits to a narrow group of individuals rather than to the broader public,\u201d the report said. The recommendations suggest a pivot away from individual business resilience training towards improving natural capital through natural resource management programs as this would provide benefits for farmers and the wider community. It added that the success or otherwise of the fund in building resilience would not be evident until tested by drought conditions. \u201cAt this stage the extent to which the fund is building drought resilience is unknown,\u201d the report said. The review was released one week after the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed Australia was in an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, with parts of the country already in drought. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, warned farmers on Tuesday at a drought summit in Queensland that Treasury analysis showed disasters and a warming climate would have large economy-wide effects. \u201cThe Productivity Commission\u2019s report highlights that drought is just one part of the larger climate change picture that means we need to focus not just on drought resilience, but broader climate change resilience too,\u201d Chalmers said.   Related: Queensland\u2019s rural debt balloons amid drought and rising land prices, report finds    Chalmers said the 2019-2020 bushfires and October 2022 floods each cost the Australian economy about $1.5bn. He added that Australian crop yields are expected to decline by 4% by 2063 due to the climate crisis, wiping $1.8bn off gross domestic product in today\u2019s dollars. Commonwealth funding under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) has increased by 433% over three years, he said, and Commonwealth spending on disaster recovery jumped from $335m in 2017-2018 to $2.5bn in 2022-2023. \u201cAs our climate warms into the future \u2013 potentially by 1.9 degrees here in Queensland over the coming three decades \u2013 we know that our farmers are on the frontline,\u201d Chalmers said. The productivity commission also recommended the department of agriculture establish a working group to help improve the design and implementation of the FDF for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, finding that Indigenous people did not participate in shared decision-making around the fund\u2019s objective, design, or governance. \u201cMany Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are directly or indirectly involved in agriculture,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remain underrepresented in the sector.\u201d The federal government has to finalise the next four-year funding plan for the FDF by the end of February 2024. The Productivity Commission said that meant now was a \u201cnatural point\u201d to map the federal, state and territory government policies and programs that support agriculture, land management, drought resilience and climate change resilience and identify overlaps.

The problem is real, schools are trying to manage this in the best way that they can, and they have to be backed by governments with the resources that they need.\u201d \nHaythorpe said there was a \u201cjoint responsibility\u201d for both state and federal governments to improve access to education for students with disabilities. \nShe said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that many public schools did not even have adequate bathroom facilities and accessible toilets for students with disabilities, while at the same time private schools were receiving lucrative government grants for capital projects. \n\u201cEvery child has a right to access education and, for students with disability, it\u2019s very important that high-level access to inclusive education is provided, but we have a system that is not fulfilling that need.\u201d", "Bonza administrators say \u2018no option\u2019 but to sack all staff after failed search for buyer [2024-06-11T04:55:43Z]": "Bonza appears almost certain to be wound up after the administrators determining the troubled airline\u2019s future terminated all staff and cancelled all future flights following a failed search for a potential buyer to save the carrier. \nOn Tuesday afternoon, administrators from the firm Hall Chadwick confirmed Guardian Australia\u2019s earlier reporting that they had convened a town hall meeting with staff that morning where they told employees they had been terminated and all future flights had been cancelled. \nEmployees subsequently voiced their frustrations at how the administration process had been conducted, sources say. \n \n  Related: Qantas announces boarding changes aimed at avoiding chaotic economy queues  \n \nThe budget airline\u2019s 323 employees had been stood down since 30 April, when the airline appointed administrators after its fleet of six Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft was abruptly repossessed. \nIt later became clear that Bonza\u2019s local business leaders had been blindsided by a breakdown in the relationship between 777 Partners \u2013 the airline\u2019s private equity sole owner \u2013 and its financier, the US insurance giant Advantage Capital Holdings, known as A-Cap, which led to a change in the ownership structure of the leased aircraft last month. \nEarly on in the administration process, the administrators had been confident of finding a buyer for the airline, but those hopes faded in recent weeks. \nThe abrupt repossession of its entire fleet of aircraft left little value in the business beyond its air operators licence. \nInterested buyers had been given until last Friday to put in offers for Bonza.  \nIn its statement on Tuesday, Hall Chadwick said no formal offers for the airline had been submitted by the deadline. \nParties who had previously expressed interest and conducted due diligence on the company ultimately opted against lodging a binding offer. \n\u201cThe administrators assisted a number of interested parties through the sale campaign, allowing each party to conduct their due diligence and formulate any offer,\u201d the statement said. \n\u201cUnfortunately, the administrators did not receive any binding offers. \n\u201cAs a result, the administrators have no option but to terminate all employees and cancel all future flights.\u201d \nThe administrators will now convene a major meeting of creditors, where employees, customers and trade suppliers will decide on the future of the company.

An additional $16bn will also be invested in regional infrastructure projects across the state, including for the CopperString 2.0 transmission project, long-duration pumped hydro projects, the Fitzroy to Gladstone pipeline and the Burdekin Falls dam. Losers The coal lobby The Palaszczuk government has stood its ground on progressive coal royalties introduced last year, despite fierce criticism from the Queensland Resources Council, which has run a $40m advertising campaign against the scheme. Dick said the increased tax was the reason the government was able to invest more than $8bn in a range of cost-of-living measures and pay down the state\u2019s debt. \u201cOur decision, to take on the mining lobby, to stand our ground, and to fight for the people of our state, has delivered a rich reward for Queenslanders,\u201d he said. Vulnerable children and families The budget papers show clearly the state\u2019s priorities have shifted when it comes to helping vulnerable children and families. There is money to hire more youth justice workers, and more police. But at the same time, staffing numbers for next year have been cut \u2013 in actual terms \u2013 from the department responsible for child safety, seniors and disability services. Renters and people in housing stress The Queensland government will spend an additional $1.1bn for social and affordable housing, with $250m slated for housing and homelessness support services. It promises 1,200 new dwellings via a build-to-rent pilot program. The government says these measures will strengthen housing supply, but community organisations say a much more aggressive response is needed.

Seven are within the state\u2019s 700,000-hectare fire ants containment zone, which stretches from the Gold Coast to Caboolture. \nBut the eighth infestation is outside that zone \u2013 at Swartz Barracks in Oakey, 130km west of Brisbane. That infestation was discovered in April and at least 128 nests have been destroyed since then. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe defence department insists specialist pest managers are routinely engaged across defence properties but experts believe the nests at Swartz Barracks went undiscovered for years. \n \n  Related: Experts say discovery of fire ants in Murray Darling Basin should be \u2018ringing alarm bells\u2019  \n \nThe Invasive Species Council is so worried that its chief executive, Andrew Cox, has written to the defence minister, Richard Marles, calling for an urgent audit of all defence properties across Australia. \n\u201cFire ants are likely to have been at [Oakey] for several years indicating a massive surveillance failure on defence land,\u201d Cox wrote to Marles, who is also the deputy prime minister, in April. \n\u201cThe detection at Oakey must trigger an audit of defence force land in Australia for fire ant infestation.\u201d \nQueensland is home to the largest army base in the country and 14 significant defence facilities. Across Australia, there are 3m hectares of defence land. \nDefence sites inside Queensland\u2019s red imported fire ants (Rifa) containment zone include Victoria, Gallipoli, Damascus and Kokoda barracks as well as the Greenbank vehicle training centre and RAAF base Amberley. \nEarlier this week, the federal minister for agriculture, Murray Watt \u2013 who received a copy of Cox\u2019s letter \u2013 replied that the Oakey detection was a \u201chigh priority\u201d for defence and the national fire ant eradication program. \nWatt said that, in addition to the 128 nests being destroyed, 192 hectares were under surveillance and 7,151 hectares were being treated around Swartz Barracks. \nThe minister said the federal and Queensland governments were \u201cworking on improved Rifa management, surveillance and suppression activities on defence bases in Queensland\u201d \u2013 particularly Greenbank and Amberley. \nThe Swartz nests were linked to existing populations in the containment zone with ants being transferred via contaminated turf, not military vehicles, the minister\u2019s letter states. \nA defence department spokesperson added that specialist pest managers were \u201croutinely engaged by defence to deliver land-management services across the estate including monitoring and control programs\u201d. \n\u201cDefence facilitates access to enable external parties to undertake biosecurity management activities on defence land in accordance with defence policy,\u201d they said. \nReece Pianta, the advocacy manager at the Invasive Species Council, said the nature of defence land \u2013 which is often used for weapons testing or artillery ranges \u2013 meant the sites were \u201cnot visited enough and they are not maintained from an ecological point of view\u201d. \n\u201cI\u2019ve had reports of fire ants personnel having difficulty accessing defence land because it\u2019s restricted land by its very nature,\u201d he said. \n\u201cI\u2019m keen to hear how they are going to improve fire ants management on defence land. I think defence land is a huge fire ant risk \u2013 it\u2019s a risk they have moved from that [Oakey] site and we should check. I suspect there are undetected fire ant nests on defence land.\u201d \n \n  Related: What are fire ants, and what will happen if these tiny killers take hold across Australia?  \n \nPianta said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d the federal government was not surveying defence land. He also asked: \u201cWhat else is on these sites that is an invasive risk to other species? There is a lack of transparency.\u201d \nThe Invasive Species Council spokesperson claimed the nests at Swartz Barracks \u2013 which were located in a quadrangle \u2013 had been there for two to five years and were reaching the density of Rifa reported in some parts of the US. \nThe independent Invasive Species Council was formed in 2002 \u201cto seek stronger laws, policies and programs to keep Australian biodiversity safe from weeds, feral animals and other invaders\u201d, according to the council\u2019s website. \nA 2021 strategic review commissioned by the Queensland government into what has now become a $1.2bn fire ant elimination program warned that defence land was \u201cof particular concern\u201d in the fight against the pest. That report was not made public until 2023. \nThe review panel, led by Dr Helen Scott-Orr, singled out Greenbank reserve and RAAF base Amberley as \u201ctwo major parcels\u201d of at-risk defence land. \nGreenbank \u201ccould well act as a reservoir for reinfestation if it were not included in any nearby suppressive program. Likewise the Amberley airbase provides ideal Rifa habitat\u201d, the review stated. \nIn March, a Senate committee chaired by Matt Canavan heard the scope of the Rifa problem was immense. Should the ants spread through Australia\u2019s habitat, the impact would be worse than the combined effects of rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats, the inquiry was told. \nUp to 650,000 Australians could be stung annually and the beef industry could be slashed by 40%. \nThe defence spokesperson said the department regularly reinforced biosecurity obligations and \u201cguidance on how to identify red imported fire ants at defence sites to all defence personnel, via base-wide communications\u201d and worked with the agriculture department to \u201censure robust biosecurity policies and processes are in place to manage risks from pests, weeds and pathogens\u201d. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThey said the eight infested defence sites were now managed in accordance with fire ant eradication program guidelines. The most recent treatment at Oakey was completed on 30 April. \n\u201cAs Oakey is located outside of the biosecurity zone, the biosecurity zone protocols did not previously apply at that site,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe increased protocols have now been applied.\u201d \nRestrictions at Swartz Barracks prevent the movement of soil, rock, mulch, potted plants or other similar material from the base, the department said. \nA spokesperson from the national fire ant eradication program said eradicating fire ants would take a \u201cwhole-of-community\u201d approach and that under the Biosecurity Act 2014 \u201call Queenslanders have a general biosecurity obligation to manage biosecurity risks and threats on property they own, manage, or work on\u201d.", "\u2018Peer influence is no joke\u2019: Australian government to fund research into youth vaping prevention [2023-12-14T14:00:02Z]": "Samantha Odo\u2019s 18-year-old son has tried a range of strategies to quit vaping but she says the process of finding what works to curb his nicotine addiction \u201chasn\u2019t been easy\u201d. \u201cThe cravings, the habit \u2013 it\u2019s tough,\u201d Odo says. \u201cHe\u2019s found that keeping busy, especially with activities he enjoys, helps distract him from the urge to vape. It\u2019s also been crucial for him to surround himself with friends who support his decision. Peer influence is no joke, and having a strong support system makes a world of difference.\u201d Odo says her son is also motivated to quit by health concerns about vaping, plus his desire to save money so that he can afford a car. \u201cI\u2019m there for him every step of the way, offering encouragement and being a sounding board when he needs it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning process for both of us, navigating this together.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Like many caregivers, Odo and her son are trying to find the strategies that are most effective to treat nicotine addiction and then stay away from the habit. Researchers hope they will soon be able to provide them with some clearer advice.   Related: Australia to ban disposable, single-use vape imports from January to help cut addiction in children    The Australian government\u2019s primary health and medical research funding agency, the National Health and Medical Research Council, has allocated $2.2m towards developing evidence-based resources to prevent vaping and e-cigarette use; to monitor youth who vape and understand what products they use and what prompts them to stop; and to understand the impact of pro-vaping content on social media. Dr Emily Stockings, the program lead of the smoking, vaping and mental health program at the University of Sydney\u2019s Matilda Centre, has been awarded $1.5m to work with young people to design resources to prevent and reduce vaping. \u201cWe have been working with a cohort of almost 20,000 young people ranging in the ages of 11 through to their early 20s, and with this funding we plan to ask those young people about vaping in a much more frequent manner to monitor rapid changes in vaping habits,\u201d Stockings says. \u201cThis will help us to better understand new products coming on to the market, where young people are accessing their vapes from, and whether cigarettes are replacing vaping.\u201d Stockings says there is concern that as federal government reforms aimed at curbing youth vaping are rolled out, those addicted to nicotine may turn to cigarettes if they are easier to source. \u201cThere is evidence to support that if you vape, you have a three times higher likelihood of also smoking,\u201d she says. By better understanding the vaping habits of young people and their motivations for doing it, Stockings says researchers can work with them to develop effective resources to help youth resist vaping. \u201cWe want to work with them to develop skills and resources that empower them to be able to say, \u2018No, vaping is not something I\u2019m interested in.\u2019 We are specifically targeting at-risk groups like young kids who are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, and kids in rural, remote, low [socioeconomic status] areas.\u201d Along with peer influence, social media influencers are significant when it comes to encouraging youth vaping, Dr Carmen Chia Wern Lim, a youth substance use researcher from the University of Queensland, says.   Related: \u2018No sympathy\u2019: why are vape stores still opening across Australia six months before ban comes into force?    Lim has been awarded $660,000 by the National Health and Medical Research Council to research how pro-vaping content on social media influences attitudes of young people towards vaping, so she can then develop interventions to protect youth from this influence. \u201cThis content is really concerning, because recent studies show that many people are actually very persuaded by user-generated content,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first step will be to get people into the lab to see what they are being exposed to, the type of content. And then the second part is to conduct focus groups with people to understand what could be deterring them from vaping.\u201d A study led by the University of Sydney and Cancer Council of NSW Daffodil Centre, published on Wednesday, found teenagers regard vaping as being safer and less harmful than parents do and that the risk of vaping uptake among teenagers significantly increases if a parent has ever smoked or vaped. Lim says it is important to understand the range of factors that influence youth vaping, including store locations and accessibility. But she says efforts to combat youth vaping and its harmful health effects are being particularly hindered by prolific pro-vaping content on social media. \u201cThese posts receive billions of views and most of them are not subject to any age restrictions,\u201d she says.", "\u2018It\u2019s going to be messy\u2019: advocates balance climate action and conservation amid Queensland\u2019s green energy boom [2024-05-04T20:00:50Z]": "A map of operating windfarms in Queensland does not take too long to survey \u2013 of the 100 or so across Australia, only six of them are in the sunshine state. \nBut this is about to change in a very big way. According to state government data, there are 46 separate proposals for windfarms in Queensland with four more already under construction. \nMany of those plans target the winds that sweep across the spectacular mountains and ridge tops of the Great Dividing Range from central Queensland to the state\u2019s far north. \nWhile this wind-grab will help wrench the state away from its reliance on coal, the movement is taking turbines and access roads into critical habitat for threatened species. \n \n  Related: Cool solution: how ice-cream saved drought-hit farmers in India  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be messy, and some negative projects will get up, but we have to keep our eyes on the broader goals,\u201d the senior manager of energy transitions at WWF Australia, Rob Law, says. \nBy 2040, Queensland\u2019s energy plan says wind will generate about 40% of the state\u2019s power. In only eight years, the government wants to get from 27% renewable electricity to 70%. \nEnvironment campaigners fought long and hard for this level of ambition and are now having to navigate difficult terrain \u2013 advocating for wind power while, at the same time, calling out bad projects and pushing others to make modifications to reduce their impact. \n\u201cWe are in a position for the first time where we have to consider trade-offs,\u201d Law says, \u201cand understanding climate change is a significant threat to our biodiversity and renewable energy is a solution to that, but renewable energy can also have impacts on habitats and biodiversity. We are seeing projects being put up that are not in the right place.\u201d \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nClare Silcock, an energy strategist at the Queensland Conservation Council, is tracking the new developments. \nEighteen projects in the state \u2013 totalling 11.6GW of electricity generation capacity (the state\u2019s entire coal fleet is 8GW) \u2013 are going through federal environment approvals. If they all went ahead, which is unlikely, Silcock says cumulatively about 15,500 hectares of vegetation would need to be cleared. \nShe said the conservation council wants to see state planning reforms that would better identify areas where projects should not be proposed, or where extreme care is needed. \n\u201cThe reason we\u2019ve been advocating for renewables is that we\u2019re watching our ecosystems being pushed to the brink by climate change. We definitely believe it\u2019s possible to have a renewable energy industry and to protect biodiversity,\u201d she said. \n \n  Related: \u2018Leave politics to the politicians\u2019: why rural Queensland is a hotbed of renewable energy  \n \nConservationists were relieved last month when the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, effectively blocked a windfarm close to the Wet Topics world heritage area because its effects on nature, including threatened spectacled flying-foxes and the northern greater glider, were \u201ctoo great.\u201d \nThe federal environment department said the minister was expected to make a decision on Windlab\u2019s downsized Gawara Baya windfarm, about 5km away from the world heritage area and formerly known as the Upper Burdekin windfarm, before the end of this month. \nWindlab wants to erect up to 69 turbines and has described efforts to reduce effects on several threatened species on the cattle property, including the Sharman\u2019s rock wallaby, koala, greater glider and the red goshawk. \n \n  Related: NSW to announce life extension of Eraring, Australia\u2019s largest coal-fired power station  \n \nThe director of the Cairns and Far North Environment Centre, Lucy Graham, said what\u2019s driving biodiversity loss in Queensland is not renewable energy projects, but land clearing, mostly for cattle grazing. One study has found between 2016 and 2021 two million hectares of vegetation had been cleared in the state. \nBut Graham says while perspective is needed, there are real risks from the state\u2019s windfarm developments. Threatened species habitat is precious and the hilltops being targeted by developers will be important refuges in the coming decades as species move up ranges to find cooler climates as global heating pushes up temperatures. \n\u201cThere are going to be some losers here, but if we don\u2019t have this transition then everyone loses,\u201d she said. \nThe rush on windfarms is happening, Graham said, against the backdrop of stalled reforms of failing national environment laws and a state planning code for windfarms that needs strengthening. That code is under review. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a reassuring situation,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe need the community to have a laser focus on pressuring governments to ensure the reforms happen quickly.\u201d \nIn February clean energy advocacy group RE Alliance released a guide for the renewables industry in Queensland to collaborate with communities and conservationists to reduce impacts on biodiversity. \nThe guide said that business-as-usual \u201cpresents risks, both to the Queensland environment and to social licence for a rapid rollout of renewable energy projects\u201d, but collaboration could \u201cgreatly reduce, and in some cases eliminate, these risks\u201d. \n\u201cWe wanted to get that dialogue going so that industry understands what the environmental constraints are and how this looks from the environmental side,\u201d the national director of RE-Alliance, Andrew Bray, said. \nRE-Alliance accepts donations from the industry but donors sign an agreement Bray says allows his group to remain independent. \nBray said most projects in Queensland are targeting the hilly ranges because these are the closest points to high-voltage transmission network where the wind blows the strongest. \nThe wind in the northern parts of the state tends to blow later in the day and in the evenings, when wind and solar generation farther south is dropping away. \n\u201cWind energy in Queensland is going to be a critical part of the overall energy supply on the eastern seaboard,\u201d he said. \n \n  Related: Tanya Plibersek rejects claims renewable projects are being held up by approval delays  \n \nThe environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said renewable energy projects were assessed \u201cin the same way as every other project under national environment law\u201d. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we support renewable energy projects, but it has to be the right kind of development, in the right place, done in the right way. \n\u201cA decade of the Liberals and Nationals meant emissions were higher for longer. It put renewable energy projects years behind, but Labor is getting on with the job of transforming our energy grid.\u201d \nIn a statement, the Queensland government\u2019s Department of Housing, Local Government, Planning and Public Works said an amended planning code for windfarms was \u201ccurrently being considered\u201d and would ensure \u201careas of high ecological and biodiversity value are protected and construction impacts are better managed\u201d. \nThe statement said: \u201cIn addition to state-level assessments and approvals, windfarms that affect matters of national environmental significance are also required to obtain approvals under the [federal] Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\u201d", "Morning Mail: $30m \u2018disadvantage\u2019 funding for private schools, Uber fare squeeze, White House denial [2024-07-09T21:00:29Z]": "Morning everyone.

Addressing the Queensland media club on Wednesday, the state\u2019s housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said a \u201cgaping hole\u201d had been left by the removal of 10,000 affordable homes operating within the NRAS in the state. The NRAS was set up by the Rudd government in 2008, and paid property owners a subsidy if they kept rents on new homes at a cheaper rate for a decade.   Related: Advocates question Queensland\u2019s ability to deliver on ambitious affordable homes plan    Scanlon said the government was opening expressions of interest for landlords to approach the government about buying some of the 4,841 properties set to exit the NRAS by mid-2025. The homes bought by the government will become social or affordable housing after consultation with community housing providers. \u201cWe would encourage anyone who\u2019s willing to sell to us to come to government, and we are keen to purchase those homes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe anticipate there will be enough take-up to deliver a significant boost to the housing stock.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Scanlon said the government had already bought up to 456 homes that were exiting the NRAS after being approached by community housing providers who sought funding through the Housing Investment Fund. The government has not allocated a budget for the purchase of the NRAS homes and says the money spent will depend on the expressions of interest they receive. Previous experience has shown about 30% of landlords were interested in selling, Scanlon said. A similar take-up rate could see a further 1,452 Queensland homes sold to the government. In cases where the government is not able to buy homes from NRAS, they would seek to provide departing tenants with social housing or other supports, Scanlon said. Executive director of Q Shelter, Fiona Caniglia, said many NRAS tenants were living in \u201cfear and distress\u201d due to uncertainty about their future living arrangements.  \u201cQ Shelter hopes NRAS owners will consider selling their properties to the state so that those households have security and affordability,\u201d she said in a statement.\u201cThis is why the future delivery of affordable housing must avoid fixed-term subsidies because eventually those households will face a cliff.\u201d At the media club, Scanlon was also asked about the income threshold limits for social housing which are vastly lower than other Australian states and have not been assessed for almost two decades. The government announced in August it would review the income threshold limits. Scanlon said the government would hope to release the results of the review either late this year or in early 2024. \u201cI thought that it would be a simple answer, but I\u2019m told that takes quite a bit of work to move through what that threshold should look like,\u201d she said. In April, Guardian Australia reported the story of the Orlandos \u2013 a family that had fallen through the cracks and could not access social housing after they were evicted from their NRAS home. The family struggled to find a rental and had no income or assets other than Centrelink, but were told they were not eligible for social housing as their income was more than $877 a week before tax.", "Morning Mail: grim find in Mexico sheds light on missing surfers; budget help for student work placements; Israel shutters Al Jazeera [2024-05-05T20:59:43Z]": "Good morning.

Quick crossword Cryptic crossword ", "Police to be given new powers to randomly scan people for knives under NSW government proposal [2024-05-06T15:00:41Z]": "Police will be able to scan people for knives without a warrant in crowded places including shopping centres under new laws being developed by the New South Wales government after stabbings at Bondi Junction, Wakeley and Coffs Harbour. The legislation will be based on Queensland\u2019s Jack\u2019s Law, which was introduced last year following a 24-month trial of the powers on the Gold Coast, sparked by the death of 17-year-old Jack Beasley in 2019.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The premier, Chris Minns, said the state had \u201cborne witness to the devastating outcomes of knife-related violence\u201d. \u201cI know that many in our community have followed the devastating media coverage and heard the stories of victims and families \u2013 tragically, there have been so many recent examples,\u201d he said.   Related: \u2018Data doesn\u2019t support this\u2019: violent NSW knife crimes at a 20-year low as new penalties take effect    \u201cOur communities are still in mourning, but it\u2019s essential that we step up to take immediate action to send a clear message that NSW will simply not accept these kinds of crimes.\u201d Beasley\u2019s father met senior members of the state government to push for the adoption of the laws in recent weeks, saying they could work like they had in Queensland. Before being expanded across Queensland last year, a review of the Gold Coast trial carried out by Griffith University\u2019s Criminology Institute found no evidence that the scanners deterred people from carrying knives or had led to a significant drop in violent crime. It said this was \u201ca very significant departure from normal criminal law and procedure\u201d. The NSW laws will give police powers to \u201cwand\u201d or \u201cscan\u201d people for knives without a warrant in designated areas including transport hubs and shopping centres. The designations will be made available where \u201crelevant\u201d weapons and knife crime have occurred within the past six months. Police would then be given the ability to wand people in the area for 12 hours, with an option to extend.  The NSW police minister, Yasmin Catley, thanked Jack\u2019s parents for sharing their knowledge with NSW and said the strategy had been \u201cmaking a difference\u201d in Queensland. \u201cNo parent should go through what the Beasleys and many other families have gone through. No life should be cut short by violent crime,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at how these strategies work in a NSW context ... These reforms will give police improved tools to quickly detect concealed knives and take action before a potential perpetrator has the chance to use them.\u201d The government would also introduce changes to make it illegal to sell knives to children, with exemptions for young people who need a knife for work or study. There would also be increased penalties for people selling knives to young people. Last year the NSW government doubled the maximum penalties for people caught with knives in public or in schools. It was met with confusion from reform advocates who said prominent crimes that prompted the changes were exceptions to the trends. They suggested assaults and robberies involving knives last year were at their lowest levels in 20 years.", "NSW budget 2023: the winners and losers [2023-09-19T08:51:13Z]": "Labor has just handed down its first New South Wales state budget in more than a decade. Here are some of the winners \u2013 and some of those who missed out. Winners The Star casino The Minns government will bail out Sydney\u2019s embattled Star casino in a decision that is set to cost the taxpayer nearly half a billion dollars in lost revenue over the next four years. The government revealed in August it would lower taxes for casinos in NSW by slashing a planned increase to the casino duty that the former Coalition government had announced eight months earlier. The budget papers released on Tuesday say the Minns government made the decision to ensure The Star\u2019s \u201congoing financial viability\u201d.   Related: NSW budget: Labor points to \u2018decade of neglect\u2019 but lack of housing showstopper may leave voters underwhelmed    The government expects its decision to lower casino taxes is expected to cost it $432m in lost revenue over the next four years, with a forecast reduction in annual revenue of between $96m and $121m until 2026-27. Labor is expecting to collect $1.5bn less in overall gambling revenue than was forecast before the March election. The government says the revised figure is a result of the lower casino tax rates, as well as a reduction in pokies use in both clubs and hotels and a \u201cmore subdued outlook\u201d for Sydney\u2019s casinos. The government says that, in return, The Star promised to protect about 3,000 jobs over the next six years and contribute to the industry transition to cashless gaming. Public sector workers Workers employed by the state government will benefit, including teachers, police officers, nurses and firefighters. The government has committed $3.6bn to an \u201cessential services fund\u201d it has created to pay for wage rises of up to 4.5% this year.  Labor went to the election promising to tear up the former Perrottet government\u2019s 2.5% public sector wage rise cap. Teachers The government will also fund historic pay rises for the state\u2019s public school teachers after months of tense negotiations with their union. From October, the starting salary for first-year teachers will go from $75,791 to $85,000 \u2013 an increase of more than 12%. Salaries for teachers at the top of the scale will rise from $113,042 to $122,100.    Motorists Chris Minns went to the election promising to end Sydney\u2019s \u201ctoll mania\u201d and Tuesday\u2019s budget includes $561m over two years to cap tolls. From January motorists will be able to claim back weekly spending above $60 on the state\u2019s toll roads. Parents of young children The parents of three-year-old children in NSW have been promised $500 a year off their childcare bills per year, costing the budget $64m over the next two years. The rebates will not be means tested and will be available to the families of every three-year-old child in a preschool program at a long daycare centre. The budget also includes $20m to build new public not-for-profit childcare centres, with a focus on western Sydney and regional NSW.    Party animals in Newcastle and Wollongong Tens of millions of dollars will be made available to the 24-hour economy commissioner to allow the office that has worked to develop nightlife in Sydney in recent years to replicate its work around the state. The government has allocated $26.8m to be spent this financial year to expand the office to Wollongong, the Central Coast and Newcastle \u201cto build vibrant, safe, and diverse night-time economies in those regions\u201d.  A new body called Sound NSW will also be established and a \u201cMusic Scene Plan\u201d developed to support contemporary music. \u201cFestivals need a secure pipeline of creative talent and workers,\u201d said arts minister John Graham as he announced $31.2m to fund these initiatives for one year. But it\u2019s not all good news for the arts, as the government will not reinstate funding for a range of arts, cultural and innovation programs left unfunded by the former government. People who already own an EV While the Minns government has ditched the Coalition\u2019s electric vehicle rebate, it will use some of the money it saves to invest $263m to speed up the delivery of infrastructure such as charging stations around the state. Losers Would-be fast rail riders Announced with a bang but killed off quietly, NSW\u2019s go-it-alone approach to building fast rail between Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong has been shelved entirely, the budget confirms. Fast rail was a flagship policy that former premier Gladys Berejiklian announced in the lead-up to the 2019 state election. Guardian Australia first reported the former Coalition government had gone cold on the fast rail plan late last year, despite spending about $100m on studies for the project. Tuesday\u2019s budget confirmed the new Labor Minns government has identified that the program \u2013 which was expected to cost in the tens of billions \u2013 \u201cshould no longer proceed\u201d. Renters and people in housing stress Housing was promoted as the centrepiece of the Minns government\u2019s first budget but it didn\u2019t ultimately include that much to directly boost housing supply. The budget includes a relatively modest $300m investment into the state-owned development organisation Landcom to build fewer than 5,000 homes over the next 16 years. Treasurer Daniel Mookhey said this was \u201cjust the start\u201d and that the government\u2019s $2.2bn overall spend on housing in the budget, mostly for infrastructure, would pave the way for more homes to be built in the future.   Related: Chris Minns open to a NSW voice to parliament regardless of federal referendum outcome    That $2.2bn package has received a mixed reception from housing advocacy groups. NSW\u2019s booming property market is forecast to deliver the Minns government billions more in revenue through stamp duty and land taxes over the next four years than it was expecting before the election in March.    People who want to buy an EV Labor has dumped the Coalition\u2019s electric vehicle rebate, axing a government subsidy of $3,000 that was previously on offer to buyers of new EVs. The decision was roundly criticised by the Electric Vehicle Council as well as the NSW opposition\u2019s energy spokesperson, James Griffin, who called it \u201cpoor environmental policy\u201d. The coal mining industry Coal mining companies will pay 2.6% more in royalties to the state government from July next year.

The mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, released on Wednesday, revealed a $12.8bn improvement for the 2023-24 financial year compared with the May budget and a total of $39.5bn more in federal coffers over the four years to 2026-27.   Related: Stronger than expected budget position to fuel calls for cost of living relief, economists say    The Albanese government has resisted calls to offer more assistance to households, pointing to existing measures including energy bill relief and cheaper childcare and gambling that saving improvements in revenue will benefit voters more in the long run by putting downward pressure on inflation.

Chalmers acknowledged there was a \u201csmall uptick\u201d in inflation in the near term, which he attributed to volatility in oil prices, but \u201cno material change\u201d to when it would be back within the target band.

The Greens deputy leader and spokesperson for education, Mehreen Faruqi, said no matter how it were legislated, paying students for mandatory placements must be an \u201cimmediate priority\u201d for Labor, particularly amid a cost-of-living crisis. \u201cUnpaid placements are really taking a toll on students as they are pushed into poverty or forced to drop out,\u201d Faruqi said. Morley agreed. She said it was crucial funding was introduced in the May budget to address chronic workforce shortages, adding the stipend should be equivalent to the national minimum wage, not be means tested and include international students. A survey of 1,000 social work students conducted by Morley in 2022 found 96.3% experienced challenges during placements, and a quarter lost up to 75% of their income. \u201cEverybody I speak to in the sector is desperately concerned at not being able to attract workers, particularly in regional and rural areas,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would be absolutely life-changing.

In 2022, an inquiry by the NSW parliament into the delivery of rural health services \u201crepeatedly\u201d heard of people being let down by the health system.

Speaking at the National Press Club, Combet said the Net Zero Economy Authority \u2013 a new government agency proposed to help manage the country\u2019s transformation from a dirty to a clean economy \u2013 was putting together a \u201cpipeline\u201d of clean industrial projects and would be \u201cfiguring out how to help bring them to concrete investment decisions\u201d.

Related: Time running out to make prosperous transition to net zero emissions, Australia warned    A former union boss and cabinet minister in the Gillard government, Combet will leave the agency next month to succeed Peter Costello as the chair of the Future Fund, the country\u2019s $212bn sovereign wealth fund. He said the authority had been designed to play a coordinating role in helping Australia become a renewable energy \u201csuperpower\u201d, initially focusing on emissions-intensive parts of the country that were home to ageing coal-fired power plants that were near the end of their life. A key part of its job would be ensuring workers and communities were supported through the change and shared in the benefits, he said. \u201cIf we do this well, Australia has the opportunity to develop numerous new clean industrial projects, involving billions of investment dollars and providing thousands of jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither government funding nor private capital alone can meet this challenge.\u201d Combet said the agency had been involved \u201cin the policy discussion\u201d in the lead-up to next month\u2019s budget, and the government had indicated it would \u201clook to capitalise on Australia\u2019s comparative advantage in minerals and renewable energy, aiming to encourage large-scale investment in green industrial production\u201d. He suggested that the government and its funding bodies would need to look beyond grants and concessional loans, and should consider direct investments in \u201cparticularly large transformative projects\u201d when necessary. \u201cGovernments may need to consider being significant equity players, helping to de-risk projects and adopting a long-term view before recovering capital,\u201d he said. Anthony Albanese has indicated the government plans to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act, which includes A$570bn in clean incentives, but acknowledges it cannot compete with it on dollar terms. The government promised $2bn for green hydrogen production in last year\u2019s budget and last week announced $1bn for solar manufacturing. Some economists have questioned whether these investments were well targeted given the scale of investment under way elsewhere, particularly in China and the US, and suggested Australia should focus on industries in which it could have a natural advantage, such as green iron. Combet said the US legislation had \u201cchanged the game\u201d, and the European Union, Japan and Korea had followed with \u201cunprecedented investments in their industrial base\u201d. \u201cThe race is on to secure the industries of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia needs to respond, and we are.\u201d He said the agency had begun work in Gladstone and the central Queensland region, which produces more than 40% of the state\u2019s energy and is home to nearly half of the country\u2019s coalmines. He said it was an example of a place that would feel the impact of what was coming but where there could be new opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s a major producer of key industrial products like cement, alumina, aluminium and ammonia, and it\u2019s a major trade hub, with the Port of Gladstone facilitating tens of billions of dollars of trade every year in exports of coal, gas and aluminium to our trading partners,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, successfully transforming the region around Gladstone, and similar regions around the country, must be a key national endeavour.\u201d He said the authority legislation included a funded redeployment scheme. The body would support workers \u201cto acquire skills, to access new employment if needed, to help create jobs in new businesses and industries\u201d, he said. \u201cThe touchstone will be how well we handle the closure of coal-fired power stations,\u201d he said.

Climate groups have calculated the potential total climate pollution from fossil fuel developments currently submitted for environmental approval. Including emissions released both during production and when the fossil fuel was ultimately burned for energy \u2013 often in overseas power plants \u2013 they found the developments could lead to an additional 22bn tonnes of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere.   Related: It\u2019s climate Christmas!

Expressed another way, it is about 40% of annual global emissions. Because the CO2 would be released overseas if the developments go ahead, most of the emissions would not count against Australia under international climate accounting rules. But campaigners say it shows the impact of the country\u2019s exports is likely to dwarf the emissions reductions being embarked on at home, and the government cannot claim to be addressing the climate crisis without addressing both.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Shiva Gounden, Greenpeace\u2019s head in the Pacific, said Australia made an outsized contribution to global emissions as the world\u2019s third-largest fossil fuel exporter. He said he was frustrated by Australia\u2019s lack of ambition going into the UN Cop28 climate summit, which began in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. \u201cDoes Minister Bowen think we will be so distracted by progress towards 43% that we can\u2019t see the colossal elephant in the room \u2013 the 22bn tonnes of emissions generated if these new coal and gas projects all went ahead?\u201d Gounden said. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of the hottest year on record, Cop28 must be a moment of reckoning on fossil fuels. There is no scenario where expanding coal and gas is compatible with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. \u201cBy exporting fossil fuels we are simply exporting climate damage.\u201d Speaking at the Art Gallery of New South Wales on Thursday before flying to Cop28, Vanuatu\u2019s climate change minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said the Australian government had told him it expected many fossil fuel projects in the pipeline would not go ahead. \u201cWe hope that\u2019s the case, and call on Australia to take a stronger position to stop them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still concerned because there hasn\u2019t been much in terms of stopping production and fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d The list of developments was compiled by Greenpeace using data from Climate Analytics, Sunrise and documents submitted to the government by fossil fuel companies. The biggest fossil fuel development up for approval is the multi-stage expansion of gas extraction and processing in northern Western Australia, centred on the Burrup Hub. It includes the Scarborough and Browse gas fields and a proposed 50-year extension for Woodside Energy\u2019s north-west shelf liquified natural gas (LNG) processing facility. Taken together, it was found it could lead to 6.1bn tonnes of emissions. Other large emitting developments on the list include expansion of two open-pit coking coalmines operated by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance. It said a potential 93-year-life extension for the Peak Downs mine could lead to 2.3bn tonnes of CO2, and a 90-year extension for the Blackwater South mine could contribute 2bn tonnes. The list of projects is a more concrete account of what could be developed than the often-cited 118 developments listed as in the pipeline by the industry department, which includes some at pre-development and feasibility stages. With one exception, the projects on the list have been submitted to the federal environment department or the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority for approval. The exception is Tamboran Resources\u2019 Beetaloo Basin gas development, which was included due to its strong support from the Northern Territory government.    Related: Time running out to make prosperous transition to net zero emissions, Australia warned    A spokesperson for Bowen said the new emissions estimate were almost entirely based on \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions released overseas, and under global carbon accounting rules these did not count against the country providing the fossil fuels. \u201cFor instance, Japan doesn\u2019t include in their emissions accounting the transport emissions in Australia from Japanese made cars, and nor should they,\u201d the spokesperson said. They said large emitters within Australia that released more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year had to reduce emissions each year under the reformed safeguard mechanism to deliver a combined 200m tonnes reduction by 2030. Changes to the safeguard mechanism that passed parliament this year under a deal between Labor and the Green require new gas fields that supply LNG facilities to offset all reservoir CO2 emissions, and shale gas projects in the Beetaloo Basin to offset direct emissions. The resources minister, Madeleine King, told a recent WA energy summit that if Australia stopped supplying LNG to its neighbours that did not necessarily mean they would stop using it. \u201cThey might simply look elsewhere for those supplies, and if they do Australia\u2019s voice in our region would be diminished,\u201d she said. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, said it was likely the 22bn tonnes was \u201cif anything a bit of an understatement\u201d.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, chief minister of the NT, Eva Lawler, and education minister Jason Clare and his counterpart Mark Monaghan will sign the statement of intent on Wednesday morning. It outlines a $1bn investment that will see all public schools in the NT reach 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) by 2029 \u2013 more than two decades earlier than would have been the case under current settings. The SRS is the benchmark for required funding based on student needs.   Related: Australian public schools must be fully funded \u2018as soon as possible\u2019, independent review finds    Under the proposed agreement, the federal government would double its SRS contribution to 40%, investing at least $748m in additional funding from 2025 to 2029. The territory government would contribute the remaining 60%, estimated to be $350m over the same period. The most disadvantaged schools would receive additional funding first and reach the SRS before 2029, with the schools to come first to be decided in the final agreement. Albanese said his government was \u201ccommitted to making sure that no Australian child is left behind\u201d, pointing to specific challenges facing the territory, including concentrations of disadvantage.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  It follows a $40.4m funding boost outlined in last year\u2019s budget for disadvantaged Central Australian schools to reach 100% of the SRS by the end of 2024. The funding needed for a public school student in the NT to bridge the gap is almost double the national average, which is why the commonwealth is paying a higher percentage of the SRS in the Territory. In the NT, public schools have reached just over 80% of their SRS, while private schools are at more than 97%, according to a Department of Education internal briefing. \u201cEducation and equality go hand in hand, however access to quality education has been out of reach for many in the Northern Territory,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThis historic agreement is yet another example of how my government is working constructively with state and territory governments across the country.\u201d It\u2019s the second statement of intent secured by the commonwealth, as Clare continues to negotiate the next National School Reform Agreement (NSRA) with education ministers. The Turnbull government\u2019s Gonski 2.0 education reforms required states to fund public schools at 75% of the SRS on top of the federal contribution of 20%, leaving a funding gap of at least 5%. No public school in Australia, except for schools in the Australian Capital Territory, is funded at the SRS level.  Western Australia was the first state or territory to ink a deal with the commonwealth in January that would see the federal government lift its funding contribution to 22.5% \u2013 equating to an extra $777m. Under the statement of intent, WA\u2019s public schools would get to the full SRS by 2026 in return for the state implementing teacher quality and student wellbeing reforms. The deal was criticised by education experts and the Australian Education Union (AEU) for locking in underfunding by continuing to allow about 4% of the SRS to be claimed by states on non-school expenditures such as depreciation, school transport and early childhood education. The Morrison-era clause will remain in the NT agreement, the education minister confirmed, equating to about $40m of the territory\u2019s annual school funding.

State governments also poured cold water on the WA deal, with New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia banding together to demand a 5% commonwealth funding increase. The NT response was muted. Clare has until the end of the year to reach a deal with the remaining states and territories. He said it was an \u201chistoric day\u201d for public education in the NT and a \u201cgreat example\u201d of governments working together for aligned outcomes. \u201cAt the moment, Northern Territory public schools only get less than 80% of the funding that David Gonski said they should,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, one in five kids are not receiving funding. This agreement fixes that \u2026 the most underfunded schools in Australia will now be fully funded.\u201d The NT government has consistently lobbied the federal government to increase its funding share to 40%, while failing for two years to meet its own bilateral funding targets. The NT and WA are the only jurisdictions where state and territory funding to public schools declined in real terms between 2012 and 2021. The AEU has similarly called for the Albanese government to lift its share of public school funding from 20% to 25% of the SRS, and 40% in the NT due to the additional need.

There will be \u201crescoping\u201d of the planning and costings of 36 projects and addressing risks in another 56, while it also green-lit 100 further projects that are not yet under construction.   Interactive   But the government does not accept all of the review\u2019s recommendations. King says some of the projects were still considered \u201cpriority projects\u201d after negotiations with the states, with allocated spending to be rolled over into \u201ccorridor\u201d funding. Plans to build fast train lines, as well as commitments to upgrade tracks to allow existing services to run more quickly, are among key rail projects axed across the country. Some key projects \u2013 such as a train to the Melbourne airport \u2013 will go ahead, leading to praise from the Australasian Railway Association\u2019s chief executive, Caroline Wilkie.  \u201cWe are in the midst of a once-in-a-generation infrastructure pipeline that will greatly enhance how Australia moves its people and freight,\u201d she said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The government also announced it would be increasing its contribution to other works, such as the Logan-Gold Coast faster rail and Western Australia\u2019s Metronet. But a range of road and highway promises are now unfunded, triggering fury from some premiers and treasurers.   Related: \u2018We deserve our fair share\u2019: state Labor leaders clash with federal government over infrastructure plan    It is also unclear which projects have been delayed and by how long, leading to criticism from the opposition\u2019s infrastructure spokesperson, Bridget McKenzie, who said the government \u201chas duck-shoved responsibility to the states to make decisions on which road upgrades and safety improvements will be axed\u201d. Here is what it means for some of the nation\u2019s biggest projects. Queensland Value of projects now unfunded by the federal government: $449.5m Despite losing considerably less under the review, outrage appears most intense from Queensland. The premier, Annastacia Paluszczuk, says: \u201cI want to make it very clear, again, to Minister King that this infrastructure review does not have our cooperation. We do not agree with this plan.\u201d Queensland is particularly concerned about the commonwealth\u2019s approach on transport corridors, which they said would cap spending on the state\u2019s most important road, the Bruce Highway. The anger was also fuelled by an earlier announcement that the commonwealth is moving away from paying 80% for regional road projects, and will mostly split the cost evenly with states. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, will lead a delegation of mayors to Canberra. The Queensland farmers\u2019 federation and state\u2019s trucking association will also join what he dubbed \u201cteam Queensland\u201d to lobby for more infrastructure funding. The main roads minister, Mark Bailey, told parliament that projects for the Bruce Highway will be in the firing line. Due to the rising cost of materials like concrete and bitumen, the price of projects is expected to increase \u2013 which would have to be paid for by the state, he said. \u201cSo the federal government is forcing decisions on project cuts on to Queensland and that is not fair,\u201d he said. The largest project to lose funding is the Mooloolah River interchange upgrade on the Sunshine Coast. The government had previously committed funding of $160m, about 50% of the total cost of the project. State government estimates put the cost to the Queensland budget at around $14bn over 10 years, with $6bn less for the Bruce Highway alone. New South Wales Value of projects now unfunded by the federal government: $5.4bn The NSW government expressed \u201cdisappointment with a capital D\u201d over the cut in federal funding for a number of major projects, including a key interchange between the M7 and M12 motorways in Western Sydney. The treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, accused King of going back on her word after she had promised not to \u201cyank\u201d funding out of any project already being delivered. \u201cAt the same time NSW\u2019s population is surging the commonwealth investment is faltering,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s even worse is that some of the projects for which the commonwealth has yanked funding are already in delivery.\u201d He says early analysis shows 18 projects may not go ahead because of the cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that NSW \u2026 has been talking to the commonwealth but they haven\u2019t been listening,\u201d Mookhey says. \u201cEvery dollar taken from NSW has to come back to NSW.\u201d Other axed projects include commuter car park upgrades at train stations in Kingswood, St Marys and Woy Woy \u2013 which were criticised by Labor as pork barrelling when first announced by the Morrison government. A billion-dollar upgrade of the Great Western Highway through the Blue Mountains is among the biggest projects to lose commonwealth funding. The infrastructure review also spells the end of plans to hasten the speed of trains between Newcastle and Sydney, with a plan to quadruple a 10km stretch of track between Tuggerah and Wyong now without funding. Support for upgrades of several regional roads was also axed, including for the Bruxner Highway in northern NSW, and for planning works relating to the Gwydir and Oxley highways. Victoria Value of projects now unfunded by the federal government: $4.8bn  In Victoria, the most significant news to come out of the review was the decision to approve the long-awaited Melbourne Airport train line. In 2020, the state and federal government each committed $5bn to the project. A business case released two years later estimated the project would cost $8-$13bn.   Related: Regional roads in dire state as Australian councils made to waste money on grants tribute signs: report    However, the government and the airport remain locked in a dispute over the project, with the latter insisting on a costlier underground station. The premier, Jacinta Allan, said she hoped the three parties would \u201crecommence negotiations\u201d and come to an agreement. Meanwhile, federal funding for 12 other projects is being cut, including $2bn for fast rail from Melbourne to Geelong. The project was a commitment made before the 2019 federal election by the former Coalition government, and relied on matching commitment from Victoria. The then premier Daniel Andrews labelled the project a fantasy but then went on to match the funding. Investigations for other \u201cfaster rail\u201d corridors across Victoria will also lose funding, along with plans to upgrade the Frankston line to Baxter and a business case for a Melbourne Inland Rail intermodal terminal. Upgrades on the Calder Freeway, the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, the Shepparton bypass on the Goulburn Valley Highway and the Western Freeway have been scrapped. Other states Projects to the value of $527m in Western Australia, and $494m in South Australia, have been axed. In Tasmania, this figure was $20m and in the Australian Capital Territory it was $3m.

Matthew had opened up to another family member earlier that evening, who made him feel more ashamed, calling him an idiot. \n \n  Related: \u2018A massive public health problem\u2019: Australian children as young as 10 are hooked on gambling  \n \nVincent kept his son on the phone as he drove to find him, telling him \u201cthe only thing that we can\u2019t solve is you jumping off a cliff\u201d. \n\u201cIt turned out he hadn\u2019t eaten for a couple of days and so we went down to local Chinese, and we were there for about three hours, just unpacking how he felt. \n\u201cI knew he played a lot of online games but I didn\u2019t know that had turned into online gaming, so to speak.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nTwo years on from that phone call, Matthew is still paying off the debt. Vincent has not probed his son on the details of his debt, as he still feels ashamed about it. Vincent understands it began when Matthew used to buy different \u201cpower packs\u201d for characters in online games, which Matthew paid for using the specific budget his dad gave him on his PayPal account. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \n \nDespite only working part-time, Matthew managed to get a credit card and he bought more game packs, which he sold for a profit. \nThe thrill of taking risks, moving money around in transactions for a potential pay off, eventually led him to other forms of gambling. \nAs increasing numbers of Australians as young as 10 are becoming hooked on gambling, online gaming is emerging as a significant factor fuelling their addiction. Many then migrate to other more traditional forms of gambling. \nFrom September, updated computer game classification guidelines  will require games involving in-game purchases linked to chance, such as paid loot boxes, to receive a minimum classification of M (Mature \u2013 not recommended for children under 15 years of age). Games containing simulated gambling, such as social casino games, will be legally restricted to adults, with a mandatory minimum classification of R18+. \n \n  Related: Online gambling in Australia has \u2018exponentially increased\u2019, new report warns  \n \nHowever, Alex Russell, an associate professor in the Experimental Gambling Research Laboratory at Central Queensland University, says unlike physical gambling settings such as casinos, where bouncers check IDs, \u201cjust because a game has a rating doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s any actual block to the kids playing it\u201d. \nDr Nancy Greer, a research fellow at the Australian Gambling Research Centre, says the convergence of online gaming and gambling takes two main forms: video games with simulated gambling elements, such as social casino game apps that look like poker; and in-game purchases of virtual containers of randomised rewards, such as Matthew\u2019s power packs \u2013 commonly known as \u201cloot boxes\u201d. \nBoth are becoming more common, Greer says. \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    Many young people are first conditioned to gamble through video game features such as \u201cloot boxes\u201d and \u201cskins\u201d.&nbsp;\n    Loot boxes are virtual items \u2013 which can either be purchased or earned in video games \u2013 that contain randomised rewards, some of which are more rare and valuable than others. Experts say loot boxes are \u201cpsychologically akin\u201d to gambling because they share many characteristics \u2013 like the exchange of money for an unknown outcome, determined by chance.\n    Skins are virtual items that can either be earned as a reward through in-game play or be bought from within the game, often through loot boxes. Skins are usually cosmetic; they could change the appearance of an in-game weapon, or the look of a character, for instance, but most have no impact on play. Some skins are considered so prestigious and uncommon that they have become a form of virtual currency and can be resold on secondary markets for thousands of real-world dollars. Skins can also be used by gamers to place bets on the outcome of online gaming and sports on third-party sites.\n    Kids can earn skins or loot boxes through play in video games, or they can buy or be given gift cards for various online marketplaces such as Steam, and use those cards to buy the skins or loot boxes.\n    They then visit third-party casino sites (which are not affiliated with the game directly) and use the skins or loot boxes as a form of currency to gamble \u2013 either wagering them directly, or depositing them with the site in exchange for the site\u2019s own currency.\n    The types of casino games played can vary from simple roulette to betting on video game match results. Players can cash out their winnings by converting them into different virtual skins (which can often be resold for real money), cryptocurrencies, or simply for cash.\n    Under Australia's Interactive Gambling Act, casino-style online games are illegal if the games are played for money or anything else of value, including skins. Overseas online casino companies are not meant to offer services to Australians and have been fined by the Australian Communications and Media Authority for doing so.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nRussell says there are different implementations of loot boxes from game to game but many meet the definition of gambling products. \nLegally, a gambling product constitutes putting something of value at risk to win something of value (it can be money, or it can be in-game items), and there\u2019s a degree of chance about whether you win or how much you win, Russell says. \nWhile a raffle at a kids\u2019 school meets the definition of gambling, features such as loot boxes in video games are of particular concern. This is because, with no cap on how many loot boxes can be bought, they promote a form of continuous play  \u2013 a key reason why many of the most harmful gambling products are problematic. \nRussell says most of the popular games have loot game features because it\u2019s the business model that video games have moved to. \n\u201cIt used to be that you would pay for a game \u2013 you\u2019d buy the cartridge or disc and put that in your Xbox PlayStation \u2013 it was a one-off purchase, and then you could just play it as long as you want,\u201d Russell says. \nHowever, that model of upfront cost was a barrier to getting customers in the door so video game companies now often offer the game for free or at a much lower price, and make money from the customer\u2019s ongoing, in-game purchases. \n \n  Related: One mother\u2019s plea for gambling ad reform - podcast  \n \nA 2020 Central Queensland University study, commissioned by the NSW Responsible Gambling Fund, analysed a representative sample of 12 to 17-year-olds in NSW and found nearly three out of every four (72.2%) had opened or bought a loot box. \nCountries such as Belgium have taken the lead, legally recognising video game loot boxes as gambling. \nIn a 2018 Senate committee report on gaming micro-transactions, the Greens recommended a review of the definition of \u201cgambling service\u201d and also urged a consumer protection framework be developed, including reporting mechanisms for concerns, policies and processes for developers and publishers to respond to safety concerns. The government noted but did not accept these recommendations in its response. \nMeanwhile, the government has been accused of walking back from reforms on a total ban on gambling advertisements online. \nDr Kei Sakata, the acting executive manager of the Australian Gambling Research Centre, says the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, which followed participants over 20 years, showed a causal link between playing simulated gambling games and being more likely to spend real money gambling when they turned 18. \nResearchers call this phenomenon \u201cmigration\u201d: people who play loot boxes are much more likely to experience gambling problems down the track. \nSakata says this occurs because online gaming, like the constant advertisements around sports betting, normalises gambling. \n\u201cThey enter adulthood and don\u2019t feel that real money gambling is particularly risky,\u201d Sakata says. \nGreer says the odds are better in simulated gambling video games \u2013 where people win nothing of monetary value \u2013 than actual pokies. It causes many who transition to real world gambling involving money to think they will have the same likelihood of success. \nVincent agrees the online gaming world creates a \u201cgrey area\u201d which confuses kids\u2019 ideas of money \u2013 sometimes making children feel currencies in the game are real when they are not. At other times, when games require real world money, the fact that it\u2019s \u201cjust a game\u201d may make losses feel less real, he says.  \n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a single reason for not banning [gambling advertising] that affects the mental health of not just our young people but people in need, people in poverty, people who are down to their last 10 bucks for a week and hoping to turn it into 100 \u2013 I can\u2019t see a situation where advertising gambling to those people is a good idea,\u201d he says. \n\u201cI support a ban on it completely,\u201d Vincent says. \n* Names and personal details have been changed to protect identities \n\u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Origin is now the third energy retailer known to have wrongly received money via Centrepay from vulnerable and low-income Australians after they had ceased being customers. Centrepay gives approved businesses early access to welfare payments before they hit a welfare recipient\u2019s bank account, a system designed to ensure individuals always have enough for essentials including rent and energy.   Related: How Centrepay plunged vulnerable Australians into debt - podcast    But a Guardian Australia investigation has identified deep and ongoing problems with the system. In one case the Centrepay system allowed the energy giant AGL to continue to take welfare money from more than 500 people who had ceased being AGL customers, resulting in overpayments over years totalling about $700,000. The company says it has now paid that money back. In other cases Centrepay has helped to financially prop up a disgraced Christian rehabilitation centre practising gay conversion practices and forced baptisms, and allowed rent-to-buy household appliance retailers to take excessive amounts from the welfare payments of customers in remote Indigenous communities. Origin Energy is the biggest user of Centrepay of any energy retailer. The ASX-listed company had 32,894 residential customers paying for their energy using Centrepay last financial year, about 1.8% of its total customer base. But Guardian Australia can reveal that Origin has also wrongly received money from the welfare payments of people who had ceased being its customers. A spokesperson confirmed Origin had identified \u201cissues relating to payments made through the Centrepay scheme\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWe proactively reported these issues to Services Australia, have been attempting to contact impacted customers and are working with Services Australia to process refunds to customers,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe have also strengthened our processes in relation to Centrepay payments.\u201d Both Services Australia and the energy company declined to say how many customers were affected or how much in welfare payments had been wrongly received by Origin. In response to a question on notice by a Greens senator, Penny Allman-Payne, the government confirmed that it was working to return Centrepay overpayments from three utilities companies and three \u201chousehold services\u201d companies. Services Australia would not release details of which companies were affected. A Services Australia spokesperson, Hank Jongen, said overpayments usually occurred when customers did not \u201cupdate or end a deduction\u201d. \u201cFor example, a customer may set up a regular deduction for their energy provider and forget to update their Centrepay deduction when they move house,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is also a responsibility for the company to make sure their records are up to date. This means keeping up to date with information provided to them from Services Australia.\u201d Jongen said overpayments were more common in industries which used a process of \u201cbill smoothing\u201d, where costs are spread out across the year to prevent bill shock. Bill smoothing is commonly used by utilities companies. \u201cCentrepay registered businesses have obligations under the Centrepay policy and terms to notify the agency where overpayments have occurred and to actively seek to return moneys to customers as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. \u2018People are unable to pay for essentials\u2019 Kate Allingham, the chief executive of Economic Justice Australia, said advocates had been calling for stronger regulation of the Centrepay system since 2013, when a government-commissioned review recommended an enhanced accreditation and auditing process for businesses. \u201cHere we are, 10 years later, with ongoing reports of people overpaying for services and products,\u201d Allingham said. \u201cPeople on Centrepay are suffering as a result, unable to pay for essentials because they are locked into payment deductions through unscrupulous business practices, with systemic issues within Services Australia preventing or delaying people from being able to stop unreasonable deductions.\u201d She called for reforms to cap the amount of Centrepay deductions that can be taken from payments and said welfare recipients needed to be given greater information about what is being taken from their payments and when. Allingham called for changes to make it easier for customers to cancel or vary their Centrepay deductions, improvements to the complaints process and stronger regulation of businesses approved for Centrepay use. Allman-Payne called for greater transparency from the government on the companies that had received overpayments and the numbers of welfare recipients affected. \u201cLabor needs to be transparent with Australians about precisely which companies are under investigation for this egregious practice, and how many people have been so horribly exploited,\u201d she said.   Related: A scheme meant to help people avoid debt is now causing it \u2013 Centrepay needs urgent repair | Kate Allingham    \u201cAnd Services Australia must expedite its review of Centrepay to determine how these companies were able to abuse the system, and ensure it never happens again.\u201d The Financial Rights Legal Centre said it was also concerned at ongoing reports of businesses receiving overpayments via Centrepay. \u201cNo one should have thousands of dollars unknowingly sitting in an account with their energy provider, while they\u2019re struggling to cover other costs like food and medicine,\u201d said Julia Davis, the centre\u2019s senior policy and communications officer. \u201cOur sector colleagues report seeing clients who had no idea they had thousands of dollars from overpayments made through Centrepay just sitting idle in an account, leaving them with little funds to pay for essentials.\u201d \u201cWhile there are legitimate reasons someone might want a buffer in their account in case of unexpectedly high bills, customers using Centrepay should be notified when they have overpaid and their accounts have gone into credit.\u201d Services Australia said it acknowledged that improvements were needed to the system and was working to reform Centrepay as a \u201cpriority\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to seeing this process through and won\u2019t be providing further comment on individual businesses regarding Centrepay policy or compliance while it\u2019s under way,\u201d Jongen said. Ergon Energy, a Queensland-based energy retailer, is also working with Services Australia to return overpayments.

Under the school funding agreement, struck in 2019, the commonwealth is meant to contribute 80% of the schooling resource standard for private schools, while state and territory governments are responsible for the remaining 20%. The split is reversed for public schools.   Related: Sydney private school\u2019s $108m expansion plan exposes education funding inequity, advocate says    Figures outlined in a Senate estimates briefing released under freedom of information legislation show four in 10 (1,150) private schools were overfunded by the commonwealth in excess of the agreed 80% level last year, to the tune of $2.5bn. Northern Beaches Christian school, St Augustine\u2019s College and MLC school, all in Sydney, were funded at 171%, 160% and 158% of the SRS respectively, about double the 80% they should have received from the commonwealth. That equated to about $13.6m of overfunding in a single year. In total, almost 40 schools received more than $2m more than budgeted in their commonwealth share of funding, including prestigious institutions Loreto Kirribilli and Normanhurst, the Council of Newington College and St Aloysius\u2019 College, also in Kirribilli. Penleigh and Essendon Grammar school and Haileybury in Melbourne and St Augustine\u2019s College in Sydney all received more than $5m in overfunding.   Interactive   Separate figures show that public schools\u2019 total funding \u2013 from the commonwealth and states and territories \u2013 averaged just 92% of the SRS. The federal government has until the end of the decade to bring all nongovernment schools down to 100% of the total SRS, with funding to increase for public schools during the same period. But despite historical funding inequities between the public and private sector, the total increase in commonwealth funding from 2023 to 2024 remained lower for public schools (4.1%) compared with Catholic schools (4.3%) and independent schools (5.8%). The deputy president of the Australian Education Union, Meredith Peace, said if the federal government could afford to spend billions overfunding private schools for the next four years it could afford to lift its investment in public schools. Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Queensland have been lobbying the commonwealth to increase its public school funding share from 20% to 25% to meet state shortfalls. \u201cJust 1.3% of public schools are fully funded right now and they must be properly resourced to be able to meet the significant challenges we face in education,\u201d Peace said. \u201cWe have a teacher shortage crisis, a serious decline in student wellbeing and widening achievement gaps between students from different backgrounds and locations.\u201d Because the freedom of information figures only include the funding private schools receive from the commonwealth, and do not capture state and territory money, they are likely to underestimate the true level of overfunding. The latest data, provided by education departments to the National School Resourcing Board, showed all states and territories excluding the Northern Territory funded private schools in excess of 20% in 2022. The education minister, Jason Clare, said he was working with his counterparts to prioritise getting all public schools to their \u201cfull and fair\u201d funding level, noting the rate of commonwealth funding was linked to a surge in private school enrolments. \u201cMost nongovernment schools are at that level now,\u201d he said. \u201cThose schools that are above that 100% Gonski level are on a track to come down automatically.\u201d \u201cThe negotiations we\u2019re having now are about how we fill the public school funding gap.\u201d But according to the Australia Institute, tax concessions provided to private schools to build expensive facilities were a large driver of continued overfunding. The postdoctoral research manager at the institute, Dr Morgan Harrington, said the amount private schools were spending on luxurious amenities and high salaries was of \u201cgreat concern\u201d. \u201cThe current system is unbalanced and unsustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of this spending is not part of core educational requirements. Removing tax concessions for private school building funds and requiring greater transparency in reporting will reduce inequities and make private schools more accountable for the public money they receive.\u201d", "NSW police urged to improve mental health training after string of deaths involving vulnerable people [2024-06-04T05:57:04Z]": "New South Wales police have been urged to improve mandatory mental health training for officers and \u201cexplore\u201d becoming the second responders to these types of emergencies after a string of fatalities involving vulnerable people. A parliamentary inquiry into mental health care across NSW made the recommendations after finding police involvement in mental health crises could cause further distress and had been harmful in a \u201csignificant number of cases\u201d. Published on Tuesday, the committee\u2019s report noted that \u201crecent tragedies\u201d involving police responses had led to \u201cfear and reluctance\u201d for some people experiencing psychological distress to seek emergency care. Overall, the report said, mental health care in NSW had become \u201creactive and crisis-driven\u201d because it was \u201cchronically and severely\u201d underfunded and was failing carers, people seeking help and those working in the sector.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The report recommended the NSW government \u201cexplore innovative revenue streams\u201d to fund mental health services, however did not go as far as recommending the state implement a levy like Queensland and Victoria to help fund the system. The NSW government on Tuesday announced an extra $112m for community mental health supports and early intervention programs would be included in the state budget, which will be delivered later this month. Dr Evelyne Tadros, the Mental Health Coordinating Council\u2019s chief executive officer, said the government should make a \u201csignificant separate investment\u201d to respond to the inquiry. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t go anywhere near far enough to address any of the recommendations,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like business as usual.\u201d In response to criticism from the sector that the funding was not enough, the premier, Chris Minns, said he understood the concerns but the government was \u201cdoing everything we can\u201d. The inquiry held hearings across the state at a time when the police\u2019s handling of mental health emergencies was under scrutiny after officers fatally wounded or shot four people experiencing mental health crises between May and September last year. NSW police have attended 94,946 mental health incidents since 2019 and the number has increased every year. Guardian Australia previously revealed that 52 people experiencing mental distress died in interactions with NSW police from 2019 to 2023. Despite this, police cadets undergo just 18 hours of mental health training, with nothing further required after they become sworn officers. The premier on Tuesday refused to commit extra funds for training police in mental health even though he said it was unavoidable that officers sometimes had to respond to people in psychological distress. \u201cIn the middle of the night, the only things that are still operating [are] NSW police and emergency departments and major public hospitals,\u201d Minns said. \u201cAs a result, oftentimes people that are in a desperate situation either interact with NSW police or one of our emergency departments.\u201d Five of the inquiry\u2019s 39 recommendations were focused on improving police responses, including that the government \u201ccontinue to explore\u201d a health-led response to mental health emergencies. A potential new model should be informed by the \u201csuccessful\u201d South Australian mental health co-responder program, the Western Sydney mental health acute assessment team and NSW\u2019s existing \u201cPacer\u201d system. The Greens MP Amanda Cohn, who chaired the inquiry, said the Labor MPs that dominated the committee had \u201cwatered down\u201d several of the recommendations so that the government only had to \u201cexplore\u201d changes rather than implement them. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty gutless move from the government,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cThis committee has just done the work of exploring and considering \u2026 we now need the government to actually get on with the job and actually implement and fund these changes.\u201d The government has three months to respond to the report. The inquiry also recommended the police publicly release their report from research they carried out last year into the United Kingdom\u2019s model as part of a review of the way NSW officers responded to mental health emergencies. Police said last year that two senior officers had been sent to London to study the \u201cRight Person, Right Care\u201d model, which has health workers rather than police attend mental health call-outs if there is no crime being committed and no risk to life. However, health experts in the UK have expressed concerns that mental health calls have gone unanswered under the new model, which has put lives at risk because health social care services have not been given the resources to plug the gap. The police minister, Yasmin Catley, said in February she had received NSW police\u2019s review and that it would be made public. Last month, she said it would be released \u201cshortly\u201d. Catley has been contacted for comment. Guardian Australia understands the report still needs to be considered by the NSW cabinet and the government is yet to decide on a timeframe in which to do so.

This week\u2019s budget update shows households are being squeezed by high prices at the same time as the tax take is increasing. Chalmers said the latest budget update had shone a light on bracket creep \u2013 a phenomenon where income growth means people end up paying higher average rates of tax. \u201cBracket creep is partly about more people earning more and that\u2019s a good thing, and that\u2019s what has refocussed people\u2019s minds on the tax cuts that come in,\u201d the treasurer said. \u201cI do believe that returning bracket creep is a worthy aspiration when governments can afford to do it.\u201d The controversial stage-three tax cuts package is legislated to take effect in July 2024. Chalmers is asked frequently whether or not he intends to overhaul the package in order to skew the return of bracket creep towards workers on low and middle incomes rather than the highest earners.

In the 2023-24 budget, the government forecast an underlying budget deficit for this year of $13.9bn, a figure likely to be revised lower in Wednesday\u2019s update. Banks such as the CBA expect the eventual result will be close to a $20bn surplus, almost matching the $22.1bn surplus \u2013 the first in 15 years \u2013 recorded for the 2022-23 year. \u201cCommodity prices are tracking well above what was assumed, population growth has exceeded all expectations, the labour market remains resilient and the 2022-23 final bottom line was five times better than expected,\u201d Pat Bustamante, a senior Westpac group economist, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a budget sweet spot\u201d, with the surplus likely to come in at about $11bn, he said. Treasury models tend to be conservative, particularly when it comes to commodity prices. The May budget, for instance, forecast iron ore prices would retreat from $US117/tonne ($A179/t) to $US60/t ($A91/t), but instead they are hovering above $US130/t ($A197/t). Coking and thermal coal are also trading at prices much higher than Treasury predicted, boosting royalties and corporate tax. In the first four months of this fiscal year, total revenue is tracking $8.4bn higher than expected, while payments are tracking $0.8bn lower, according to Westpac. Chris Richardson, an ex-Treasury economist and now independent commentator, said the government had \u201cevery incentive to calm the horses with respect to the amount of dollars they have\u201d. \u201cIt helps keep fellow ministers in line and it helps keep the punters in line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult explanation to say to families, \u2018We\u2019ve got money and you haven\u2019t, and tough luck, we\u2019re not helping.\u2019\u201dThe higher than expected inflation rate has been a boon for budget revenues through the tax bracket creep, something the government has been tight-lipped about. A swelling workforce, though, has also helped and Chalmers will spruik that outcome. \u201cWe know people are still under pressure but inflation is moderating, wages are growing and unemployment is low,\u201d Chalmers said. The government estimates labour market upgrades account for about a third of the budget\u2019s revenue upgrade over the four years to 2026-27. The economy has added more than 620,000 jobs since the May 2022 election, the most for a first-term government, Chalmers\u2019 office has said. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is due to release labour market details for November, which may add to the employment tally. Economists expect the economy added a net 12,000 jobs last month, not enough to stop the jobless rate edging higher from 3.7% in October to 3.8%. The range includes the ANZ forecasting the economy lost 30,000 jobs last month, while the CBA expects a 15,000-job gain. Chalmers has already revealed a few details of the budget update, including a projection that rising borrowing costs will add $80bn to expenditure over the 11 years to 2033-34. The jump in interest payments, averaging 11.7% a year over the next decade, will exceed the 10.1% pace for the NDIS, 6.5% for hospitals and 6.3% for defence, Myefo will show. Richardson said that projection may prove too pessimistic, since bond rates have since retreated to about 4.3%.  Richardson said the budget update would \u201cessentially be a tug-of-war between the good news from things like iron ore prices and bad news from things like the cost of the NDIS\u201d. \u201cThe difference is the good news will ultimately be temporary and the bad news will tend to hang around\u201d, affecting future budgets, he said.", "Revealed: Private school students reap thousands more than public students in disability funding [2024-04-28T15:00:10Z]": "Wealthy private schools are receiving a government assistance payment for students with disabilities up to six times higher than that received in the public system. A Guardian Australia investigation has uncovered a vast disparity in the funding flowing to high-needs students as mainstream schools struggle to support the almost 1 million students in Australia now reporting a disability. New data shows that public school students eligible for a disability payment receive an average amount from the commonwealth of $2,941, while more than 100 non-government schools receive, on average, in excess of $10,000 per funded student. State governments \u2013 which are responsible for allocating funding to public schools \u2013 do not use the same methodology to fund individual support for students with a disability as the federal government, which allocates funding directly to private schools.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  This means a disabled student with the same level of need is not guaranteed the same level of support in a public school. The data, which was provided by the Department of Education to the Senate, shows Mooroolbark Grammar in Melbourne \u2013 a private school with links to the Church of Scientology \u2013 is receiving an average of almost $16,000 for each student receiving the federal government\u2019s \u201cstudent with disability\u201d (SWD) payment. Radford College in Canberra receives an average of almost $13,000 per funded student, while Loreto Normanhurst and MLC school in Sydney receive an average per student of about $12,000. The average amount for each student in the New South Wales public system eligible for the SWD is $2,600. How the system works The SWD payment is based on data reported to the federal government by every school in Australia through the Nationally Consistent Collection of Data on School Students with Disability.   Related: How the rise of autism and ADHD fractured Australia\u2019s schools    The top three categories of the NCCD \u2013 supplementary, substantial and extensive \u2013 attract a federal support payment depending on the level of support needed, ranging from $5,694 to $42,298 a student. The lowest level does not attract any funding, with about 300,000 students not receiving any financial support through the loading payment. Because the federal government is the main funder of private schools, 80% of the SWD payment flows directly from the commonwealth to the school. But for public schools there is no direct link between a school that reports the data and the payment it ultimately receives, with the federal government paying 20% of the disability loading to the state education department in line with its 20% share of the school resourcing standard paid to the states. The state education department then uses its own methodology for allocating disability support payments, meaning the disability payment may never reach the student reported under the NCCD as needing financial support. Private schools that are receiving more than 100% of the school resourcing standard as a result of being overfunded by the commonwealth are also receiving more than 100% of the SWD loading payment. For example, Loreto Kirribilli in Sydney was entitled to 134% of the school resourcing standard in 2023, granting it a loading payment also set at 134%, equating to $10,499 a student on average. The link between the NCCD categorisation and state funding support varies between states but individual support funding is going to a fraction of the number of students eligible for the student with a disability payment. Unlike other federal government school payments, the disability loading is not adjusted based on the financial capacity of families to contribute to education costs. The disability loading payment is forecast to cost $3.6bn in 2024 and has grown at an average annual rate of 15% over the past five years. It now accounts for more than 10% of the commonwealth\u2019s recurrent schools funding, with 60% of the total amount going to non-government schools. \u2018A complete lack of transparency\u2019 The Australian Education Union\u2019s federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said it was \u201cshameful\u201d the government was paying far more to wealthy private schools than to public schools to support students with a disability. The union is pushing for an increase in the federal government\u2019s contribution to the school resourcing standard and also wants funding to go to the 30% of disabled students who now receive none. \u201cGovernments talk a lot about a fully inclusionary education environment, but they haven\u2019t been prepared to fund public schools to provide it,\u201d Haythorpe said. \u201cPrincipals are endlessly juggling money trying to determine what they can delay or reduce spending on, such as school maintenance, so they can provide more support for students with disability.\u201d   Related: Why the Guardian is investigating the deep failings in Australia\u2019s school system    Victoria University\u2019s Stephen Lamb, a former member of the National School Resourcing Board, said the funding for students with disabilities nationally was a \u201cdog\u2019s breakfast\u201d, with each state assessing and funding student needs differently. \u201cThere is no consistency. A parent in one state may have a very different experience compared to what plays out in another state.\u201d A 2019 report into the student with disability payment undertaken by the board noted that there was a \u201cweak alignment\u201d between the NCCD data and the amount state education departments ended up paying to support students with disabilities in public schools. Lamb said private schools were benefiting from the NCCD payment but there was no way of knowing how much of the federal loading was flowing through to state schools, criticising the \u201ccomplete lack of transparency\u201d. \u201cParents, families and schools don\u2019t know what they should be getting under these different models and you end up with nobody knowing. \u201cIf there is any child with need in a school, that child has to be our organising principle, we need to ensure everything is in place for that child, but there are a lot of children who are not getting what is needed.\u201d Guardian Australia sought information from all state government departments about the link between NCCD status and targeted funding in public schools. Most states provide two funding sources \u2013 a low level funding amount paid as \u201cblock\u201d funding to each school, and a separate package of support available for individual needs. None of the states was able to advise how much they paid schools to support each student eligible for a commonwealth loading payment. Western Australia reports that about 65% of all students in the top three categories received individual disability allocation funding from the state government in 2023 but it does not use NCCD data to determine its payments. In NSW only 17,800 students with moderate to high support needs received individual funding, compared with the 148,000 students in the top three categories under the NCCD. The Queensland Department of Education claimed an extra 40,000 students with disability were supported in 2023 than under a previous funding model. But it did not provide a breakdown of individuals funded compared with the NCCD data. A spokesperson for South Australia\u2019s Department of Education said it was \u201cunable to identify the percentage of students who benefit from state targeted programs\u201d registered under the NCCD but said 6% of government school students received individual funding support.

After all, Melbourne\u2019s West Gate Tunnel, first expected to cost $500m, then revised to $5.5bn, is now $10.2bn and counting, while the city\u2019s Metro Tunnel has blown out by at least $1.36bn. The total cost of the Suburban Rail Loop, meanwhile, is anyone\u2019s guess. But the overruns threaten to define Jacinta Allan\u2019s premiership. In explaining why the cost of the North East Link had grown since the project\u2019s business case was put together in 2017, Allan blamed several \u201cunforeseen global circumstances\u201d, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the soaring cost of materials and inflation. These factors, as well as changes to the project\u2019s design and an upgrade of its adjoining roads, will add $13.43bn to the total cost. The blow out alone is more than double what Labor suggested the entire project would cost back in 2008.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, said a \u201cperfect storm\u201d had contributed to the cost overrun but suggested the government was also to blame for overheating the market. He said six years ago, when the North East Link\u2019s business case was put together, unemployment was higher and interest rates lower, so it \u201cmade sense\u201d for governments to borrow to build. \u201cVictoria did it with gusto, reflecting the sort of big government philosophy of the Andrews government,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt led to a situation where Victoria in particular \u2013 but various governments around Australia \u2013 were trying to do a whole bunch of infrastructure projects all at once, which has accentuated the cost pressures now.\u201d    Projects that look really shaky, like the Suburban Rail Loop, we should cancel them.    Oliver said the government was now competing in a tighter labour market for the workers and the materials it needs to complete all its big projects. \u201cThere\u2019s an argument that\u2019s adding to inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cAdd in the higher interest rates and it\u2019s inevitable these projects are going to blow out.\u201d The Grattan Institute on Thursday released modelling that warned the \u201cbig build\u201d will affect the private sector. It said domestic builders will struggle to find the workers and materials needed to reach the government\u2019s target of 800,000 homes in the next decade, \u201cgiven the scale of the state\u2019s infrastructure build\u201d. The Housing Industry Association, Infrastructure Australia, the Property Council and the Urban Development Institute agree. The government should reconsider whether to proceed with any new infrastructure projects, the Grattan Institute\u2019s economic policy program director Brendan Coates said. \u201cProjects that look really shaky, like the Suburban Rail Loop, we should cancel them,\u201d Coates said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a generation\u2019s worth of infrastructure spending, where the benefits are really unclear. Whereas, when it comes to housing, the benefits are really clear.\u201d   Related: Victoria announces first large Suburban Rail Loop contract amid \u2018excessive secrecy\u2019 concerns     According to the modelling, if Victoria reaches the housing target, rents could be 13% lower than otherwise by the early 2030s, saving renters up to $14bn over the decade, and by almost $3bn in 2033-34 alone. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything, and trying to do everything ends up being really expensive,\u201d Coates said. It\u2019s something the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, is keenly aware of. When he announced his mid-year budget update last week, he conceded he would like to see the government\u2019s $21.3bn annual spend on infrastructure shrink because of \u201cthe crowding-out effect that it\u2019s having on the private sector\u201d. Allan, however, denied the government was overheating the construction market. \u201cOne of the things that has an inflationary impact on projects is having a lack of skilled workers available to come and work on those projects,\u201d she told reporters on Monday. \u201cThat is why having a pipeline of projects like we do here in Victoria means that we\u2019re keeping workers engaged.\u201d She said workers on the Metro Tunnel and West Gate Tunnel would be able to move to the North East Link and Suburban Rail Loop projects. In any event, the issue will follow the Allan government into the new year.   Related: Melbourne\u2019s $12bn Metro Tunnel to open in September 2024, builder lets slip    The opposition this week wrote to the Victorian Auditor General\u2019s Office requesting an urgent review of all major transport and infrastructure projects announced or under way and will probably pursue the blowouts through parliament. Ratings agencies are keeping an eye on the state\u2019s finances and have warned of further downgrades if they continue to deteriorate. With the budget tight, the government will also struggle to spend on anything else \u2013 including its promised new hospitals, women\u2019s health hubs and schools, as well as the wages for the essential workers it employs \u2013 such as child protection workers, doctors, nurses, police and teachers. But those within the Labor party argue all Allan has to do is \u201cweather the storm\u201d until some of the projects are finished. Metro Tunnel is on track to open in late 2024, and the West Gate Tunnel in 2025 \u2013 both well before the 2026 election. \u201cPeople won\u2019t remember the cost when their commute is halved,\u201d one MP said.", "Federal budget improvement is good news for Jim Chalmers but households still face squeeze [2023-12-13T00:33:23Z]": "Only a collapse in commodity prices or a sharp rise in unemployment \u2013 and probably both \u2013 will prevent the Albanese government from delivering back-to-back budget surpluses. Jim Chalmers\u2019 challenge as treasurer will be to fend off the inevitably rising demands to share some of his good fortune with households set to face a prolonged squeeze likely to last until mid-2025, when the next federal election must be held. The government\u2019s prediction of a deficit of just $1.1bn is a rounding error in a budget which projects receipts of $685.3bn for this fiscal year, according the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook released on Wednesday. Those receipts alone are $17.2bn higher than projected in the May budget for the 2023-24 year. The Treasury\u2019s in-built conservatism when it comes to commodity prices is partly why a surplus can confidently be predicted (and why banks including CBA expect it will come close to matching the $22.1bn surplus pocketed for 2022-23).  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Iron ore prices, for instance, were averaging US$105 a tonne in the September quarter of this year, and were trading above US$135/t yesterday. Treasury has them dropping back to US$60 as it always does. Every US$10/t discrepancy adds or cuts $5.3bn to nominal GDP and $500m for the budget. Coking coal prices, too, are forecast to slide 88% and thermal coal to more than halve, collapses that don\u2019t seem likely. Indeed, in explaining why inflation has lately surprised on the upside, the Treasury has \u201cupdated\u201d its forecast for the Singapore-based Tapis oil price that serves as a proxy for petrol prices in Australia. It now expects Tapis to average US$96 a barrel for the year, up 10% from its May expectation of US$87/barrel. Since Australia\u2019s coal and gas prices are linked to global energy prices it seems even more incongruous than usual to expect a reversion to some long-term (and outdated) level. Commodity prices gyrations, of course, are only one of the challenges for households struggling to keep up with rising mortgage costs as higher interest rates flow through. In the September quarter household consumption was flat and the Myefo forecasts don\u2019t expect things to improve much.   Related: Myefo 2023: Australia\u2019s federal budget on track for wafer-thin $1.1bn deficit     In fact, consumption on the home front will expand just 0.5% this fiscal year, slower than 1.5% predicted in the May budget. Next year\u2019s trend is a bit friendlier, with 2% expansion forecast but that\u2019s also a half percentage point down on the May prediction. \u201cThe household saving ratio has fallen in recent quarters and is expected to average 2% in 2023-24, its lowest annual level since 2007-08,\u201d Myefo notes. \u201cIt is also likely that some households are needing to draw upon previously accumulated savings to support their consumption and service mortgage costs.\u201d The report notes that expectation among economists that the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate of 4.35% is \u201cat or near its peak\u201d. The higher cash rate profile, compared with the May budget\u2019s peak rate forecast of 3.85%, \u201cwill act as an additional drag on consumption and dwelling investment over coming quarters\u201d, it said. The independent RBA, of course, makes the call on the official interest rate. It\u2019s notable that the government\u2019s inflation forecasts don\u2019t quite gel with what the central bank expects. According to Myefo, the headline consumer price index will slow from 3.75% by next June to 2.75% by the middle of 2025. In other words, that\u2019s within the 2% to 3% target the RBA is targeting. The difference, though, is the RBA is so far not expecting CPI to slow to 3% until the end of 2025. The discrepancy is likely to be material for the budget \u2013 assuming the RBA\u2019s model is more accurate. (The Treasury lifted the June 2024 CPI rate by half a percentage point versus its May forecast but did not change where it expected it to land a year later.) Higher inflation has been a key reason for the budget\u2019s improved underlying cash position and to the extent the Treasury has underestimated it, revenues will be higher through bracket creep \u2013 as we saw clearly in the national accounts for the September quarter. Will those squeezed households tolerate being under the pump while the budget coffers swell? That may hinge on how wages and jobs go. Myefo does predict the economy rebounding a bit next year. Gross domestic product will expand 1.75% this fiscal year \u2013 slowing from 3.1% last year \u2013 and quicken to a 2.25% pace in the 2024-25 year. Not great, but no recession. The labour market, though, should hold up relatively well. The jobless rate, now at 3.7% as of October, should creep up to about 4.25% by next June, a Myefo estimate in line with the May budget\u2019s prediction. By the end of June 2025, that rate will be at 4.5%, a level still better than most treasurers have gone to an election with over the past five decades. Incomes should also return to real growth early in 2024 for the first time in three years.", "Treasurer Cameron Dick all smiles as coal fight results in billions flowing into Queensland\u2019s budget  [2023-06-13T06:06:58Z]": "A year ago, common logic suggested the Queensland government was taking a huge political risk by increasing royalties on record-high coal prices, and picking a fight with the cashed-up mining sector. Plans to increase taxes on the miners have been historically fraught. Meanwhile, the wounds inflicted on Labor by the Adani saga still feel fresh. And this is Queensland, where the black rock is still king, and critical to the state\u2019s economy and its identity.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Cameron Dick\u2019s latest budget, flush with $15.3bn income from coal royalties, has brought the bigger picture into focus. Labor is running a version of Muhammad Ali\u2019s famous \u201crope a dope\u201d strategy \u2013 inviting superficial attacks and leaving opponents\u2019 weaknesses badly exposed. Everything voters might want \u2013 a budget surplus, debt reduction, cost-of-living handouts, infrastructure projects, new housing, health funding \u2013 is now linked to the decision to increase royalties on unprecedented profits. In Dick\u2019s words, the royalties \u201cunderpin everything that we are doing\u201d. \u201cA Queensland without progressive coal royalties \u2026 means there will be no cost-of-living relief, cancelled infrastructure programs, cuts to services, and a higher debt burden. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a credible opinion on this budget without having a credible opinion on royalties. [Opposition leader David Crisafulli] needs to accept that, or he needs to start cutting back on the $89bn capital program and tell Queenslanders what he\u2019s not going to build.\u201d If this is starting to sound familiar, it\u2019s because it is. These are versions of the same attack lines on potential LNP cuts that Labor used in 2020. And 2017. And 2015. The only thing missing was the dark spectre of Campbell Newman, dressed like death and carrying a scythe. Labor uses these lines again and again because they are effective. Queenslanders want public services and publicly-owned assets. If the LNP opposition offers anything other than full-throated support for the coal royalties, they\u2019ll be fodder for Labor\u2019s attacks (and scares) about hidden cuts. Last year, Dick warned the mining industry that its campaign \u2013 reportedly costing $40m in advertising \u2013 could backfire and damage the sector\u2019s social licence. On Monday, the day before the state budget, Dick told the Queensland Resources Council to \u201cshow some respect\u201d while coalminers were making record profits and households were struggling with the cost of living. There is no question that the decision to increase royalties has put Queensland on a stronger economic footing coming out of the pandemic. It has helped the state pay for significant cost-of-living relief measures and long-overdue programs like free kindy for preschoolers. But the true irony here is that, by the next election, the impact of the state\u2019s royalty changes will have largely disappeared. The system was designed so that miners paid higher rates while export prices were at extraordinary and record highs. When global shocks end, and coal prices return to normal, so do the royalty rates. Subsequently, most of the spending is on one-off measures. Over the next four years, the state budget anticipates \u201ca sharp decline\u201d in coal prices and for royalties income to drop below long-term averages. Most of the extra money being fought over is already in the coffers. So by the time all of this public debate has played out, on election day in October next year, the argument will be largely academic anyway.", "Public school advocates warn Albanese government billions at stake if it breaks funding promise [2024-02-19T23:00:30Z]": "Public schools stand to lose billions of dollars if the federal government breaks an election promise to remove a Coalition-era loophole from funding agreements between the commonwealth and the states, advocates have argued. The provision, introduced by the former Morrison government in 2018, allows states and territories to spend up to 4% of the total funding in the agreements on areas not directly related to schools, such as public transport, capital depreciation, regulatory bodies and preschool.   Related: To assert Western Australian public schools will be fully funded by 2026 is simply not true | Trevor Cobbold    Data from the advocacy group Save our Schools (SOS) shows public schools have lost about $13bn in the six years since the clause was introduced.

In opposition, the then shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, vowed to \u201cdeal with\u201d the \u201caccounting tricks\u201d that allowed states to artificially boost what they claimed was their share of the funding.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But pressed on whether the federal government would renounce the policy in future funding agreements in Senate estimates last week, the assistant minister for education, Anthony Chisholm, refused to answer. \u201cObviously the current agreement is one that was put in place by the previous government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 in the process of negotiating new agreements over the course of this year.\u201d Asked to clarify the position on the 4% clause, the education minister, Jason Clare, said the federal government was \u201ccommitted to working with states and territories to get all schools on a path to full and fair funding\u201d. Since 2019 public schools have lost more than $3bn each in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland to the 4% allowance, the data shows, while schools in WA lost $1.5bn and those in South Australia nearly $1bn. The economist Trevor Cobbold, the national convenor of Save our Schools, said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that state Labor governments were prepared to prolong the arrangement.  \u201cPublic schools will lose billions,\u201d he said. Education ministers are due to meet on Friday to continue negotiations over the next joint agreement, with states pushing for the commonwealth to raise its contribution to public schools by 5%. The Turnbull government\u2019s Gonski 2.0 education reforms required states to fund public schools at 75% of the Schooling Resource Standard \u2013 the benchmark for required funding based on student needs \u2013 on top of the federal contribution of 20%, leaving a funding gap.  No public school in Australia, except in the ACT, is now funded at the SRS level. In contrast, private schools in all jurisdictions except the Northern Territory are funded at more than 100%. Last month the commonwealth reached a deal with Western Australia to lift its contribution to 22.5% by 2026, with the state government to make up the remaining 77.5%.   Related: \u2018Deliberate lie\u2019: education lobby group says \u2018landmark\u2019 school agreement falls short of 100% funding    But it was criticised by education advocates for retaining the 4% provision.

Cobbold said the future of public education was at stake if agreements with the other states reflected WA\u2019s.  \u201cThe new agreement with WA has set a precedent \u2026 that will defraud public schools of billions in funding over the next five years,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the current agreements, apart from the ACT \u2026 are compromised by these accounting tricks that condemn public schools to ongoing underfunding. \u201cThese provisions don\u2019t apply to state funding of private schools. Yet state governments provide school transport for private school students and their curriculum and standards regulations apply to private schools as well.\u201d The Greens\u2019 education spokeswoman, Penny Allman-Payne, said Labor had promised to bring transparency to the funding system.  \u201cYet here they are, doing deals to lock in public school underfunding for the foreseeable future and calling it \u2018full funding\u2019 \u2026 that directly contradicts what they said in opposition.\u201d", "Stuart Robert hands in official resignation, triggering byelection in Queensland seat  [2023-05-18T02:34:20Z]": "Former Morrison government minister Stuart Robert will not return to the federal parliament after he officially resigned from politics by way of letter. Robert announced his intention to resign on 6 May but did not give a date of when it would happen.

Nominations remain open, although the field has narrowed down to two candidates, Gold Coast councillor Cameron Caldwell and emergency doctor Dinesh Palipana. Caldwell is considered the favourite given his ties to the electorate and profile as the council representative for the area, while Palipana is considered a frontrunner for the next state election. Fadden has been held by the LNP every election bar one since 1977. At the last election, Robert won it with a 10.6% margin, despite an almost 5% swing against him. Labor does not expect to win the seat at the coming byelection, given the need for a double-digit swing Robert\u2019s departure comes ahead of his close political ally and former Canberra flatmate, former prime minister Scott Morrison, who is also speculated to be leaving the parliament soon. Robert was reported in the Niki Savva book Plots and Prayers to have prayed with Morrison, a fellow Pentecostal, that \u201crighteousness would exalt the nation\u201d, ahead of the Liberal party leadership vote that made Morrison prime minister. Morrison elevated Robert, who he often referred to as \u201cbrother Stuie\u201d back to the cabinet after he was dumped by Malcolm Turnbull as a minister in 2016. That put Robert in charge of what became known as robodebt. He admitted during the royal commission to making several comments on the scheme throughout 2019 that he personally believed were false, defending himself by saying he was bound by cabinet solidarity. After adverse court findings and advice the scheme was unlawful, Robert announced the robodebt scheme would be \u201crefined\u201d on 18 November 2019, but did not apologise and claimed only a \u201csmall cohort\u201d of people were affected.

Queensland energy minister Mick de Brenni will announce the pilot fund on Thursday to support developments in First Nations communities and those prone to tropical storms. He said the project aimed to help build energy resilience and reduce power bills, while also helping to decarbonise the state. \u201cQueensland\u2019s grid is one of the largest in the world and some of these communities at the fringes \u2013 many of which are First Nations communities \u2013 are heavily reliant on infrastructure that is vulnerable to severe weather,\u201d de Brenni told Guardian Australia.  The fund would be used to create a series of micro grids connected to the main grid, but also able to function independently if needed.  Yarrabah Aboriginal shire council mayor Ross Andrews said the announcement was an \u201cencouraging first step\u201d for energy sovereignty. Yarrabah is near Cairns on Gunggandji and Yidinji country, an area that frequently loses power during North Queensland\u2019s monsoonal storm seasons. \u201cWe thought: why not have our own form of alternative energy supply that can\u2019t be so easily cut off, and is totally owned and operated within the community \u2013 and assist our families with energy prices and the cost of living,\u201d Andrews said.

It\u2019s affordable, reliable, secure, and clean energy for our community to be resilient.\u201d Griffith University senior lecturer and energy expert Dr Sascha Stegen said that building micro grids would only lower power bills if it is was coupled with battery storage.  \u201cThat additional control of the grids could perhaps help lower bills, but only if it is triggers people to employ energy and storage in that area,\u201d Stegan said. It would however make taking that next step easier, he said.  de Brenni said the fund would work in conjunction with existing federal and state initiatives to help communities attract investment in renewable energy.  \u201cThe [total] investment will be significantly more than $10m,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really about identifying the first tranche of projects.\u201d Initially the fund will offer grants of up to $5m to support the construction of a micro grid, and between $250,000 up to $750,000 to help projects get \u201cshovel ready\u201d. de Brenni said participating projects would be subject to detailed design and planning support as well as a regulatory review to assess legal and bureaucratic limitations.

Thank you for saying g\u2019day even when my flight was delayed | Vivienne Pearson [2024-05-02T03:18:56Z]": "Bye bye Bonza. I will miss you. As someone who lives in regional New South Wales and has family in country Victoria, I am mourning the loss of the only direct Gold Coast to Albury flight. I\u2019m also sad I did not get a chance to fly from Gold Coast to Darwin, a route I\u2019m astonished no other airline offers. In case you\u2019re not yet in the know, Bonza airline has gone belly-up. Not literally, though I did have a very rough Bonza landing at Albury airport just before Christmas \u2013 I think the pilot thought the tarmac was a couple of metres lower than it was \u2013 but the plane was upright once we came to a hastier-than-usual stop. I have no expertise in economics or aviation so I\u2019ll leave others to speak to reasons behind Bonza\u2019s final departure call. I\u2019m hearing it was \u2013 and we are \u2013 victims of neoliberalism and that the airline was both born of, and killed by, the downhill effects of its US-based backers. Instead, I\u2019d like to compose a eulogy for U Beaut Bonza. Like the best eulogies, there\u2019ll be space to speak well of the deceased along with remembering their unique sense of humour. I\u2019m a firm believer in not unnecessarily romanticising those who have departed so I\u2019ll not shy away from the not-so-bonza issues with this budget airline which, after being born in January 2023, was taken from us far too soon.    The endless ocker determination to call staff \u201cLegends\u201d rather than \u201ccabin crew\u201d quickly wore thin    The best thing about Bonza was its focus on regional Australia. Sure, to get to your country destination (let\u2019s say Wangaratta in north-east Victoria), I can fly into a major city (Melbourne) but then I need to drive through the hellish city landscape (I\u2019m looking firmly at you, Western Ring Road), followed by hours of mindless motorway (yep, I\u2019m calling you boring, Hume Highway) or (cue hysterical laughter) spend huge numbers of hours on public transport. In contrast, what a joy to fly direct to Albury, a relatively short unencumbered drive to where some of my in-laws live. Bonza flew to Albury from the Gold Coast three times a week. As in, once a day on each Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. That wasn\u2019t often enough, especially for more fine-tuned visits as my father-in-law got older and then, sadly, for his funeral. I confess that, prior to this week, I would have put money on Bonza doing so well that this schedule would be increased to daily. It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not a betting person.   Related: Bonza is the latest victim of Australian neoliberalism. It\u2019s hard to see a new airline arriving any time soon | John Quiggin    There was a heck of a lot of Australia that wasn\u2019t covered by Bonza \u2013 like anything west of a wonky diagonal line drawn between Darwin, Alice Springs and Mildura \u2013 but it was brilliant that Bonza offered stops at regional NSW cities like Port Macquarie and Newcastle, many places in the huge state of Queensland, and more direct options to get to and from places like Darwin and Alice Springs. Thank you, Bonza, for including those of us who don\u2019t live in a capital city. And at a good price. However, even when Bonza\u2019s purple planes \u2013 that had names like Shazza and Bazza \u2013 were in the sky, not all was well. Booking could only happen via an app that offered no information about cost until you selected one specific flight and, even then, a confusing mix of \u201cseat only\u201d and \u201cdiscounts on baggage\u201d prices. Apparently, you used to be able to contact Bonza but not recently; my husband ended up just letting a seat go empty as, despite significant effort, he could not find any way to change his flight after his father died. There was a hilarious theme-park element to flying Bonza. First up, there was heaps of hokey Australiana. Though initially fun, the endless ocker determination to call staff \u201cLegends\u201d rather than \u201ccabin crew\u201d quickly wore thin. I can also tell you that the \u201cG\u2019day\u201d at the start of each half-hourly email during a multi-hour delay failed to convey its intended cheer. More successful was the landing announcement that anyone travelling for work-related reasons should \u201ctry not to work too hard\u201d. Overall, I loved Bonza far more than a previous budget airline, Tiger, who used to deposit Melbourne-arriving passengers into a literal cage, with no staff around and a 1970s swimming pool-style exit gate that was scarily difficult to manage with young kids and luggage. Today, I\u2019m relieved that we didn\u2019t have any tickets booked and sad for everyone who has lost money and had a holiday or other important plans totally stuffed by Bonza\u2019s demise and apparent inability to issue refunds. Those in the know are saying it\u2019s unlikely another regionally-focussed budget airline will come along any time soon. That\u2019s a great shame, as Australia\u2019s smaller towns and regions are bonza places to work, live and play. \u2022 Vivienne Pearson is a freelance writer.

[2023-12-13T04:48:56Z]": "Treasury officials produce an end-of-year budget and fiscal outlook called Myefo, or the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. Sometimes, Myefo is effectively a mini-budget. But most often, it\u2019s about housekeeping. Given the proximity to Christmas, Myefo can attract seasonal analogies in news coverage: the Grinches that Stole Christmas, or Spendathon Santa is Coming to Town. As the Albanese government tries to bank higher tax receipts and limit discretionary spending in an effort to curb inflation, while leaving open the option of producing a second surplus in next May\u2019s budget \u2013 this year leans more Grinch than Santa.   Related: Myefo 2023: Australia\u2019s federal budget on track for wafer-thin $1.1bn deficit     The big savings measure Labor says it has produced $72.7bn in savings since coming to office. A further $9.8bn in savings and reprioritisations are booked in this Myefo. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, was fortunate to get the infrastructure minister, Catherine King, as her secret Santa this year because the majority of this year\u2019s contributions \u2013 $7.4bn \u2013 come from King\u2019s portfolio. In mid-November, the infrastructure minister confirmed the government would slash 50 high-risk infrastructure projects across the country, with savings directed at other \u201cnation-building\u201d projects. From big, to biggish Myefo says the government will raise $500m from a decision to stop allowing interest charged by the Australian Taxation Office to be claimed as a tax deduction. Taxpayers incur interest when they don\u2019t pay their tax debts on time, or they self-assess incorrectly, resulting in money owed to the ATO. Both the general interest charge and shortfall interest charge are now tax deductible. The government says removing these deductions will encourage taxpayers to pay on time and not mess up self-assessment. The crackdown begins from 1 July 2025.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Passports and penalty units up If you need a new passport after July 2024, be prepared to fork out. Myefo reveals passport fees will increase by 15% from next July, raising $349m in revenue over three years after 2024-25. That money will be redirected to other priorities in the foreign affairs portfolio. As well as passports, there\u2019s also additional revenue raising from penalty units. What\u2019s a penalty unit you ask? These are fines payable for communication, financial, tax and fraud offences. At the moment a penalty unit is $313. That will increase to $330 once necessary legislation passes the parliament, increasing receipts by $4.5m over five years from 2022\u201323. Also up: the tax take overall Inflation might have peaked, but Australians are very conscious of the cost-of-living squeeze \u2013 paying higher prices for essentials like food and electricity. Wages are starting to tick upwards after a long period of stagnation. The tax take is also up. Receipts have been revised up in Myefo by $64.4bn over four years to 2026\u201327. Strong employment growth means more people in the labour market paying more income tax. High commodity prices and strong corporate profits have increased the company tax take as well. Tax receipts are running currently at 23.7% of GDP. That ratio is high in historical terms, although everything is relative \u2013 this measure hit 23.9% during the Howard era. Myefo forecasts the tax to GDP ratio will come back to 23.3% by 2026\u201327. Driving the take-up of electric vehicles   Related: Federal budget improvement is good news for Jim Chalmers but households still face squeeze    Speaking of tax, the government will increase tax receipts by $155m over five years from 2022\u201323 by tweaking the luxury car tax. This measure looks ahead to an emissions reduction strategy for transport we\u2019ll see early next year which includes a fuel efficiency standard for cars. The government will tighten the definition of a fuel-efficient vehicle from July 2025 and adjust indexation rates. The new definition for tax purposes reduces the maximum fuel consumption from 7 litres for every 100km, to 3.5 litres for every 100km. The measure in Myefo says the change will encourage greater take-up of fuel-efficient vehicles. But there are still big calls on spending It\u2019s obvious the government is trying to resist big cash splashes beyond the measures it has already implemented to help Australian households manage high inflation. While polls show people want more help, opening the purse strings could make inflation worse. It\u2019s possible more help might come in next May\u2019s budget depending on how things are tracking. But while the government is attempting to maintain fiscal discipline in tough economic times, Myefo confirms there are big calls on the budget over the years to come: in health, in defence, in the national disability insurance scheme, in aged care, and for the transition to net zero.", "Schools funding and reforms panel: five key takeaways [2023-12-11T14:00:38Z]": "An expert panel has released its much-anticipated review into Australia\u2019s education system which is set to inform the next five years of funding and reforms. Education ministers will now begin negotiations on the next national school reform agreement (NSRA), which was delayed until 2025 for the review to be conducted. Over the course of the year, the panel, chaired by Dr Lisa O\u2019Brien, visited 92 schools, held more than 130 meetings and surveyed about 25,000 parents, teachers and students. Here are five key takeaways. 1. Fully funding public schools More than a decade since the landmark Gonski review recommended changes to fund Australian schools according to need, 98% of public schools remain under-resourced.   Related: Australian public schools must be fully funded \u2018as soon as possible\u2019, independent review finds    That\u2019s according to the schooling resource standard (SRS), the minimum baseline agreed to by governments for students to access a decent education. Just the Australian Capital Territory has reached it, and on its current trajectory, the Northern Territory never will. Equity is the centrepiece of the report, with its panel noting disadvantaged students are three times more likely to fall behind their classmates, while Australian schools also have some of the highest levels of social segregation among OECD countries. The panel said full funding to 100% of the SRS was a \u201ccritical prerequisite\u201d for successful education reform, learning and wellbeing improvement across the country. \u201cThe uneven playing field and funding shortfalls the Gonski reviews sought to correct persist and need to be addressed,\u201d the report read.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cIt is crucial that all governments and school systems aim to achieve 100% of the SRS for every school as soon as possible \u2026 in particular, the panel notes the special circumstances of the NT, which may require additional support.\u201d The commonwealth has committed to work with state and territory governments to get every school to 100% of the SRS. Negotiations will now begin on when \u2013 and if \u2013 a target will be introduced. 2. Screening student progress The report found too many children were falling behind in early years and failing to catch up to their peers. It has called for consistent universal screening of student progress in fundamental literacy and numeracy skills from year 1, with targeted programs like small group or individual catch-up tutoring to be offered to children failing to meet standards. \u201cThe significant proportion of students who are falling behind indicates that despite the significant efforts of systems and schools, current approaches are not providing all students with foundational literacy and numeracy skills,\u201d the report read. \u201cUniversal screening is the most effective and cost-efficient way to ensure any student at risk of falling behind in their learning is identified early and given the help they need to catch up.\u201d The year 1 phonics check would be rolled out to all schools by the end of 2026, with a numeracy check to follow by the end of 2028. The data would be reported nationally. 3. Schools to act as community hubs The role of schools as education providers would be radically expanded to better integrate with other community services under the review\u2019s recommendations. The panel found \u201cfar too many students\u201d fell behind because they struggled to access supports they needed, including in allied health. It cited data suggesting students with poor mental health had more than double the number of absent days than their peers and, by year 9, were up to 2.8 years behind in literacy and numeracy. \u201cPsychological distress has increased among young people over the last 10 years \u2026 in some places, there is a cluttered and fragmented landscape of supports which can be difficult for students, families and schools to navigate,\u201d the report read. Placing wellbeing at the centre, dedicated in-school functions like speech and occupational therapists and wellbeing coordinators would be offered in schools to provide referrals to counsellors and psychologists. In addition, the panel has called for a national student wellbeing measure to be implemented by the end of 2028, collecting data on belonging, safety, engagement and classroom disruption. 4. Addressing workforce shortages The report has recommended new subject-specific roles for top teachers and learning opportunities to raise the status of the profession to reverse major workforce shortages and retain employees. The centrepiece is a new national career pathway frameworks to be established by the end of 2027, to recognise accreditation for courses like micro-credentials and better deploy expertise. It includes the establishment of two new subject-specific roles for teachers, including a school-based \u201cinstructional specialist\u201d and region-based \u201cmaster teachers\u201d, selected via a competitive process. The panel also recommended improving access to high-quality teaching resources.   Related: Flexible schooling: how it sparked a \u2018hysterical\u2019 response and what families really think    \u201cMany teachers do not feel adequately recognised or valued, despite competitive starting salaries,\u201d the report read. \u201cBetter incentives, enhanced career pathways and better employment conditions are needed to attract and retain teachers and school staff. \u201cAttrition rates are high, with around one in five beginning teachers leaving within the first three years \u2026 despite the efforts of school systems and approved authorities, teachers feel overworked.\u201d Additionally, the panel argued more must be done to ensure the workforce was diverse, including increasing First Nations educators to address cultural safety and racism in schools. 5. A \u2018data custodian\u2019 Too many data gaps exist in the education sector, the panel warned, particularly amongst priority equity cohorts including students with disabilities. It\u2019s recommended wide-ranging reforms to data collection, transparency and accountability, to better track students and advise the community where needs-based funding is being directed \u2013 and how it\u2019s being used. \u201cThere is a lack of transparency and accountability in current funding arrangements tracing back over decades,\u201d the report read. \u201cFamilies and communities do not have visibility of how public funding is allocated and expended, particularly in relation to how needs-based loadings flow through to schools. \u201cOur system is falling short of community expectations of transparency and limit our understanding of how investment or policy changes may impact student outcomes.\u201d To fill the gaps, an independent body would become a \u201cdata custodian\u201d by the end of 2026, tasked with developing a more \u201cmature\u201d approach to governance and data-sharing.", "Other states rebuff Albanese government\u2019s deal with WA to boost public school funding [2024-01-31T05:25:22Z]": "A \u201clandmark\u201d deal between the Albanese government and Western Australia to co-fund public school improvements has been rejected by all other states.  The federal education minister, Jason Clare, on Wednesday announced the five-year deal in which the commonwealth and WA will jointly pay to lift the state\u2019s public schools to the schooling resource standard (SRS) by 2026 in return for the state implementing teacher quality and student wellbeing reforms. Government schools in WA will receive an extra $777m under the deal.   Related: ChatGPT is coming to Australian schools. Here\u2019s what you need to know    Despite the Albanese government\u2019s intention to roll the same co-funding plan out nationwide, the Australian Education Union and other states have called for the commonwealth to unilaterally lift its funding share to close the public school funding gap. The Turnbull government\u2019s Gonski 2.0 education reforms required states to fund public schools at 75% of the SRS on top of the federal contribution of 20%, leaving a funding gap of at least 5%. Currently no public school in Australia, except for schools in the Australian Capital Territory, is funded at the SRS level \u2013 a benchmark for required funding based on student needs. Federal Labor was criticised by the AEU for its vague commitment ahead of the 2022 election to put schools on a \u201cpathway\u201d to full funding and again in December 2022 for extending the existing schools funding agreement to the end of 2024. On Wednesday Clare and the WA premier, Peter Cook, announced a deal for each government to provide an extra 2.5% of the SRS, lifting the commonwealth share to 22.5% in two steps in 2025 and 2026. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the \u201clandmark agreement\u201d was the first of its kind but the federal government \u201cwill be working this through with every state and territory government\u201d. The scale of the WA deal, if replicated nationwide, suggests an extra $1.5bn to be spent on public schools by the commonwealth, matched by each of the states. But NSW\u2019s deputy premier and education minister, Prue Car, said the state maintained its position that the commonwealth should fund the remaining 5% to help schools reach their SRS level. \u201cState governments are facing unprecedented pressure to continue to provide world class services to a growing population, and as the largest state in the Commonwealth NSW is no different,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOur government has committed to reach 75% of the Schooling Resource Standard by 2025 - that\u2019s two years earlier than the previous government\u2019s target.\u201d State governments in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia have also maintained their commitment to seeking 25% funding from the commonwealth.    The AEU federal president, Correna Haythorpe, applauded the WA deal but said it \u201cwill only see WA public schools reach 96%\u201d of the standard. That is because WA\u2019s share is \u201cartificially inflated by 4% through the inclusion of costs not directly related to the education of students in schools, such as capital depreciation, transport and regulatory costs\u201d, she said. The AEU wants the Albanese government to lift its share of public school funding from 20% to 25% of the standard, and up to 40% in the Northern Territory. Trevor Cobbold, an economist and national convenor of advocacy group Save our Schools, condemned states that did not accept the deal, saying they were failing to commit to better funding of public schools. \u201cThat is disastrous,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Cobbold backed the union\u2019s argument that WA\u2019s government schools would still be funded to less than 100% of their SRS. Sarah Henderson, the opposition spokesperson for education, said the Coalition would consider the proposed funding package. Henderson said the commonwealth was already meeting its 20% funding requirement under the Gonski model and said the \u201cbig gap\u201d was the states and territories.   Related: Does a public school education in Australia really cost $93k?     In return for the increased funding, WA will implement reforms to be negotiated this year, drawing on recommendations of the independent expert education panel which reported in December. The panel recommended ongoing screening on student progress in literacy and numeracy from grade one, with catch up supports for under-performing children, greater professional development among teachers and a strengthened link between schools and community health services, including a national wellbeing measure.", "X should answer to Queensland authorities over Islamophobic tweets by an American, tribunal hears [2023-09-19T07:48:24Z]": "Queensland authorities should be able to hold X responsible for the Islamophobic tweets of an American white supremacist because they were downloaded in the state and caused harm to local Muslims, a tribunal has heard. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network (Aman) lodged a complaint to the Queensland Human Rights Commission last June seeking to hold X, then known as Twitter, responsible for content posted by a far-right account that was referenced in the manifesto of the extremist who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.

Private insurers are now widely refusing to provide coverage for physical and sexual abuse to organisations working with vulnerable children in out-of-home care and youth homelessness services. The decision by commercial insurers to abandon the field, described by one state minister as \u201cmarket failure\u201d, was caused by reforms removing time limits on civil abuse claims, which prompted a wave of new cases. Governments fear that, without insurance, non-government organisations will simply cease providing critical care and homelessness services. That has prompted the urgent design of temporary indemnity schemes that allow governments to pay out child abuse complainants where an institution is unable to do so.

The Queensland, Tasmanian, West Australian and New South Wales governments have all confirmed to the Guardian that they have been forced to offer indemnity for child abuse to non-government organisations. The NSW state government said it had struck indemnity deals with 47 providers of out-of-home care and youth homelessness services. Of those, five were faith-based organisations. NSW set up its temporary indemnity scheme as states and territories work urgently for a more permanent solution. The temporary scheme limits each provider to $5m, inclusive of costs such as defence costs, and is only available where organisations have been \u201cunable to obtain insurance in the commercial market\u201d. The scheme also only covers abuse that has occurred since 30 June 2017. \u201cIn the event the costs associated with one or all claims in the period exceed $5 million, the service provider will bear those costs above $5 million,\u201d the scheme\u2019s guidelines say. A Department of Communities and Justice spokesperson said the scheme will end at the end of this year and is only designed as temporary cover for out-of-home care and youth homelessness providers. \u201cThe scheme addresses the immediate risk to service delivery, while a sustainable long-term solution to the lack of insurance for PSA is identified and implemented,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe NSW government relies on our non-government sector partners to deliver crucial [out-of-home care] and youth homelessness services to vulnerable children, young people and their families. \u201cObtaining insurance for PSA risks is a critical issue for OOHC and youth homelessness services in NSW, and nationally.\u201d Providers are made to pay a fee to join the indemnity scheme. The WA government also confirmed it was \u201ccurrently indemnifying impacted organisations within the out-of-home care and youth homelessness sector\u201d until a longer-term solution can be found. The Tasmanian government confirmed to the Guardian it has only indemnified one organisation for child abuse. Queensland has indemnified 18, including Anglicare Southern Queensland and four other church or faith-based groups. States and territories have formed an inter-jurisdictional working group in an attempt to come up with a more feasible long-term solution. \u201cCommunity Services Ministers across Australia have established an Inter-Jurisdictional Working Group to identify a long-term solution for physical and sexual abuse (PSA) insurance for out-of-home care and youth homelessness providers,\u201d a WA department of communities spokesperson said. \u201cIn the interim, each jurisdiction is responsible for managing [physical and sexual abuse] insurance.\u201d Victoria is not affected by the problem because since the early 2000s it has offered a state-funded program of insurance for community service organisations, including those providing out-of-home care and youth homelessness support.   Related: Australia\u2019s child abuse redress scheme will be opened to prisoners in recognition of trauma\u2019s impact    The indemnity schemes have prompted questions about the morality of allowing taxpayer-funded financial protection to institutions who have, in some cases, woeful records of allowing and covering up child abuse. Last week, the Blue Knot Foundation\u2019s president Cathy Kezelman said taxpayers would be right to be \u201cconcerned that their money is being used to enable a powerful institution to effectively abrogate its responsibilities\u201d. Queensland\u2019s minister for children, Leanne Linard, said last week that the \u201cmarket failure\u201d in private insurance put critical services for vulnerable children at risk. She said it also risked leaving survivors without compensation. \u201cIf claims are made that providers are unable to meet, people who have experienced physical and sexual abuse miss out,\u201d she said. \u201cThe market failure for physical and sexual abuse insurance for out-of-home care and youth homelessness services is a national issue and we are working with other states and territories on a range of options to achieve a longer-term solution.\u201d  In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800, or Bravehearts on 1800 272 831, and adult survivors can contact Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

It\u2019s there for that right reason of corrective behaviour, guidance, education \u2026 The problem is it\u2019s being applied to issues that I think it should not be applied to,\u201d Carroll said. \nThe criminologist Kerry Carrington said it is clear nothing has changed since the inquiry. \n\u201cThis is really serious racism within a watch house. It\u2019s like they\u2019re impervious. They have impunity. They can get away with it and there\u2019s just basically no accountability,\u201d she said. \nIn most other workplaces the kinds of remarks heard in the recordings would result in dismissal or suspension, according to Carrington. \n\u201cIt has to be shown to be repeated but if you work for the big mines, for example, if it fits a certain level of gravity it is automatic dismissal.\u201d \nTim Prenzler, a leading expert in police accountability, said the revelations \u201cunderscore the need for a much more robust and independent integrity management system for the QPS\u201d. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nA Queensland police spokesperson said the force\u2019s ethical standards command had recently created a state case management unit to \u201ccentrally manage complaints \u2026 including sexism, misogyny, homophobia, racism and bullying\u201d. \n\u201cA team of specialist investigators now provide consistent, objective and independent responses to these types of allegations,\u201d they said. \nThe state\u2019s corruption watchdog, the Crime and Corruption Commission, which oversaw the investigation, agreed with the ruling. \nHowever, Gunggari person Maggie Munn, the national director at Change the Record, said it was \u201cmind-blowing\u201d that the officers involved had avoided serious repercussions.  \n\u201cThese things were serious enough for someone to courageously blow the whistle and it\u2019s only been investigated internally.

Scientists search for the cause as volunteer carers are overwhelmed [2024-03-02T23:00:42Z]": "Dr Tim Portas pulls the patient from a cardboard box, wraps him in a towel and touches a cotton bud on his eye to see if he can blink. Patient number 1,433,093 is one of about 3,500 Rainbow lorikeets that have come into the RSPCA\u2019s wildlife hospital near Brisbane since the beginning of the year with a mystery paralysis. This bird is one of the lucky ones. He can swallow and walk \u2013 albeit with a drunk-like gait, staggering across the triage room floor \u2013 so it\u2019s a quick injection of fluids and off to the aviary. \u201cHe\u2019s a got good prognosis for recovery,\u201d says Portas, the hospital\u2019s veterinary director. Across the corridor in the bird ward, a few dozen lorikeets are paired up in cages for more intensive care and hand feeding.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  \u201cThey\u2019re such a beautiful bird, but they\u2019re cheeky and cranky little buggers,\u201d says Jaimee Blouse, a senior nurse at the hospital. \u201cThey bite hard and they have sharp claws,\u201d she says, holding up her hands to show the scratches of treating hundreds of the distressed birds.   Related: Australian populations of threatened bird species fall 60% in past 40 years    By the time we have returned from the aviary, there are another dozen lorikeets inside boxes in a reception area waiting to be seen. In recent weeks, about 100 paralysed lorikeets a day have been coming in to the hospital.    For more than a decade, Australia\u2019s most often sighted bird \u2013 a ridiculously colourful and gregarious high-speed parrot with an ear-piercing screech \u2013 has been going down with a mystery syndrome. But this year, the numbers afflicted with so-called lorikeet paralysis syndrome (LPS) have been far and above anything seen before. Across south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales \u2013 a hotspot for LPS cases \u2013 more than 5,000 lorikeets have been taken in at wildlife care centres since the beginning of the year. \u201cIn the past it\u2019s been a trickle of cases,\u201d says Dr Tania Bishop, head vet at the wildlife rescue charity Wires. \u201cBut then 2021 really spurred us on to form a working group. But this year has been something altogether different.\u201d Wires has set up a \u201clorikeet drop-off point\u201d in the town of Grafton \u2013 the centre of the syndrome in northern NSW.    Symptoms of LPS range from mild to deadly. Some birds have trouble flying and look drunk when they walk. Others lose their ability to blink and their shrill screech starts to crack, and they struggle to swallow and breathe. If left untreated, the worst cases will die from starvation, dehydration or be an easy meal for other animals, including cats. Because of the sheer numbers, vets have been forced to prioritise which birds to try to nurse back to health, either at rehabilitation facilities or in the homes of volunteer licensed carers. Many hundreds have been painlessly euthanised with anaesthesia and then barbiturates. Bishop has euthanised several hundred lorikeets this year. \u201cVets and carers really do care for their birds, but no one is trained to see death and suffering on a scale like this,\u201d she says. An avian whodunnit Rainbow lorikeets are one of Australia\u2019s most common birds and the paralysis syndrome is only affecting a tiny percentage of the species. But the scale of the suffering is making a group of about 20 scientists coordinated by the University of Sydney even more determined to understand the cause. The syndrome peaks in summer and there is also concern some of Australia\u2019s large bats are also showing similar symptoms (the RSPCA hospital in Brisbane has treated about 250 flying foxes with paralysis this year). \u201cWe\u2019re probably looking at five times more birds this year than we have had in the past,\u201d says Prof David Phalen, an avian vet at the University of Sydney who, along with Portas and Bishop, is among the scientists trying to unravel the mystery. \u201cWe really need to get to the bottom of this but I\u2019m hopeful this is the year we break into the cause,\u201d he says.   Related: Birdwatching changes the way you look at the world \u2013 it truly is the gateway drug to environmental awareness    The organs of the birds have been analysed, multiple necropsies carried out, toxicology tests completed and even DNA analysis of the birds\u2019 droppings. Samples of plants close to sites where birds have been found are also being checked. Researchers have ruled out any infectious disease and there is no evidence so far that chemicals such as pesticides are to blame. Phalen says the working hypothesis is that the birds are being affected by a toxin such as a bacteria or fungi, which could be growing on the plants they feed on.    Rainbow lorikeets feed on nectar, pollen and native fruits. But narrowing down what they are eating will be difficult. Portas says DNA analysis of the gut contents of lorikeets has so far turned up about 150 different plant species. \u201cIt\u2019s a real whodunnit kind-of mystery,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the challenge will be, once we know what it is, how do we control it?\u201d The worst day Phalen says the toll on vets and carers who have had to witness thousands of suffering birds has been high. \u201cThese lorikeets \u2013 each one has its own personality. They\u2019re smart and beautiful and to have to kill bird after bird is terrible,\u201d he says. Robyn Gray remembers one afternoon \u2013 \u201cthe worst day\u201d \u2013 when she had about 200 lorikeets arrive in boxes and cages that were scattered around her house.    Gray is a retired office clerk and a licensed volunteer carer for Wires and lives near Grafton. Her spare bedroom was turned into a makeshift triage ward. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t walk or swallow, we thought they were suffering and they needed to be euthanised. The poor birds were in a lot of pain,\u201d she says. But Gray now has about 350 lorikeets recovering from LPS in two aviaries in her back yard. Some are getting ready to be released, as are about 50 of the birds with the RSPCA in Brisbane. \u201cOnce it\u2019s all over I\u2019ll revisit everything and I will probably crumble after that,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re all little lives and you want to save them all. You have to do something in this life to help, or else what\u2019s the point?\u201d", "Australia signals desire to resume UNRWA funding to ensure \u2018fewer children are starving\u2019 in Gaza [2024-02-01T06:02:36Z]": "Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Penny Wong, has signalled that resuming Australia\u2019s funding to a key UN agency delivering aid to Gaza is the only realistic route \u201cif we are serious about trying to ensure that fewer children are starving\u201d. Wong has directed Australia\u2019s humanitarian coordinator, Beth Delaney, to \u201clead urgent work coordinating with like-minded partners as well as UNRWA\u201d to work out the next steps, after more than 10 countries suspended funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Australia, the US and the UK were among donors to suspend funding to UNRWA last weekend after the Israeli government provided the agency with information alleging as many as 12 staff members were involved in the 7 October attacks on Israel.   Related: Australia and top allies in talks over UN aid funding in Gaza    The government has yet to give a timeframe for reinstating funding to UNRWA, but it is likely linked to progress on multiple investigations into the agency. Wong on Thursday played down the idea of channelling the $6m in frozen Australian funds through another organisation. She said it was important to remember \u201cthe scale of the humanitarian crisis\u201d in Gaza and \u201cthe absence of any alternatives if we are serious about trying to ensure that fewer children are starving\u201d. \u201cWe have reports from the UN that 400,000 Palestinians in Gaza are actually starving and a million are at risk of starvation,\u201d Wong told reporters. \u201cAn estimated 1.7 million people in Gaza are internally displaced and there are increasingly few safe places for Palestinians to go.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Wong said more than 1.4 million Palestinians were sheltering within UNRWA facilities and about 3,000 agency employees were \u201cworking on the humanitarian response in the most trying of conditions\u201d. Wong said successive Australian governments, since 1951, had funded UNRWA \u201cbecause it is the only organisation which delivers the sort of assistance and substantive support into the occupied Palestinian territories within the international system\u201d. Wong said the government had been clear in stating that the allegations made against UNRWA staff were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and they needed to be \u201cthoroughly investigated and those responsible need to be held to account\u201d. Wong addressed the issue after a meeting with New Zealand ministers in Melbourne. The New Zealand foreign minister, Winston Peters, said the allegations were \u201cdeadly serious\u201d and must be investigated. But he said New Zealand\u2019s next tranche of funding to UNRWA was not due until the middle of the year, and that meant there was time for Wellington to assess the findings of the investigations. \u201cWe do not want to hear people rushing to the press say New Zealand has stopped it, because we have not,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe are looking at what this investigation means.\u201d Guardian Australia had earlier reported that Australia was in talks with close allies including the US and the UK to consider conditions to reinstate funding to UNRWA. The Israeli government, which has long been critical of UNRWA, has argued the agency\u2019s problems go deeper than the allegations surrounding 7 October involvement, and it should have no future role in Gaza. Aid agencies and Palestinian diplomats have appealed for the funding to be reinstated, citing the extreme humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza as Israel continues its military operation in the besieged territory. The US is demanding the allegations against UNRWA staff be fully and thoroughly investigated and that measures be put in place to prevent any repeat if they are proved. The Coalition has argued Australia should redirect funding to another agency such as the Red Cross.

The \u201cstate significant development\u201d lodged with the New South Wales Department of Planning by MLC school in Burwood includes an expansion of its existing aquatic centre and a performing arts and sports centre. The proposal is in its preliminary planning stage. Experts say the application lays bare the inequity of overfunding the private system, amid figures provided at Senate estimates showing the top 10% of private schools ranked by parent incomes were receiving a quarter of ongoing overfunding.

Of those, 92 have a median family income of more than $260,000. The commonwealth has until 2029 to bring funding levels down to their agreed level of 80% for private schools \u2013 with many continuing to be funded well in excess of 100%. In 2024, MLC school received $5.9m in commonwealth funding, the latest data shows, representing 145% of the SRS. In 2022, its funding was at 171% of the SRS. According to the figures, the private girls\u2019 school was overfunded by the commonwealth government to the tune of $2.7m in 2024, while total overfunding from 2022 to 2028 was estimated at $16.3m. According to internal Department of Education figures released last year, 1,152 \u2013 or 40% \u2013 of private schools would continue to be overfunded by billions of dollars to 2029, to an estimated value of $3.2bn.

According to My Schools data, analysed by Guardian Australia, more than 40 of Australia\u2019s 100 most affluent schools had their funding increased \u2013 not decreased \u2013 from 2021 to 2022, despite some schools seeing a decline in enrolments. Among them was the Frensham school in New South Wales, which had its funding increased by $1.4m despite a minor decline in students. The convener of public education lobby group Save our Schools, Trevor Cobbold, said the MLC development pointed to the \u201cinherent unfairness\u201d of the current school funding model. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve got this amount of overfunding from the taxpayer, it frees up their fee income to be used on luxurious facilities,\u201d Cobbold said. \u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous. It points to the inherent unfairness of the current funding model. It\u2019s heavily biased in favour of private schools. \u201cNo government school is overfunded to this extent \u2026 yet taxpayer money goes into this operation for a group of the richest families in the country.\u201d According to figures provided at Senate estimates, the median family income of students at MLC school was $260,000 in 2022. The school receives tuition fees, in addition to government funding, of up to $40,000 a year from each student. The school says it prides itself on its \u201cextensive co-curricular program\u201d that includes diving, fencing, multiple types of gymnastics, tennis, skiing and swimming in its physical education offerings. The architectural plans lodged with the department propose a new two- to four-storey performing arts centre and sports complex, alongside a two- to three-storey extension of its existing aquatic centre.

The NSW state government has joined Victoria and Queensland in pushing the commonwealth to increase its contribution to the public system, now sitting at 20%. Last month, Western Australia accepted a deal for the federal government to lift its funding level to 22.5%, less than the 25% pushed for by states and education unions. A spokesperson for the NSW education minister, Prue Car, said the state government \u201cstrongly believes\u201d the commonwealth should put more money on the table so all NSW public schools are fully funded to the SRS by 2025. \u201cSecuring this agreement with the commonwealth will ensure public schools can continue to provide world-class services to the state\u2019s growing cohort of students,\u201d the spokesperson said. Asked whether it was equitable that MLC received $5,873 a student from the commonwealth in 2024, the federal education minister, Jason Clare, said the government was \u201cfocused\u201d on making sure public schools were funded properly, adding the agreement with WA was an \u201cexample of that\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s just the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to fully fund public school across the country.\u201d The Australian Education Union president, Correna Haythorpe, said overfunding by governments was allowing private schools to divert income into \u201cluxury facilities and vanity projects\u201d. She pointed to the fact only 1.3% of public schools were fully funded, none of which were in NSW. The state government has pledged to reach 75% of the SRS by 2025. \u201cIt is a never-ending battle to see who can build the most ostentatious facilities whether it is pools or performing arts centres or libraries that look like Scottish castles,\u201d Haythorpe said. \u201cThe Minns and Albanese governments need to strike a deal this year that ends the underfunding of public schools. \u201cWe are not asking for Olympic pools and polo fields \u2013 just modern, safe classrooms, libraries and learning spaces where teachers can give every child the support they need to succeed.\u201d The Greens spokesperson for schools, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, said it was \u201cpatently unfair\u201d Australia\u2019s wealthiest schools were able to use public money towards \u201cgleaming monuments to their privilege\u201d.

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, also fired a political warning shot against resuming the funding but Australian aid groups said the dire situation in Gaza would \u201crapidly escalate without UNRWA\u2019s critical support\u201d. The aid groups implored the government to \u201cbe judicious and discriminate between allegations against a small number of individuals and the foreseeable impact of defunding UNRWA on millions of Palestinians reliant on their services, including children\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  More than 10 donor countries \u2013 including Australia, the US and the UK \u2013 suspended funding to UNRWA after allegations from Israel that as many as 12 of its staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, who has frozen $6m in funds she pledged in mid-January, said the allegations made against UNRWA staff were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and they needed to be \u201cthoroughly investigated and those responsible need to be held to account\u201d. But the minister gave a strong hint on Thursday that the government was considering reinstating funding, depending on the progress of those investigations. She said it was important to remember \u201cthe scale of the humanitarian crisis\u201d in Gaza and \u201cthe absence of any alternatives if we are serious about trying to ensure that fewer children are starving\u201d.   Related: Australia signals desire to resume UNRWA funding to ensure \u2018fewer children are starving\u2019 in Gaza    The Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, said 136 Israeli hostages, including infants, were still \u201cheld in Hamas dungeons without any trace of assistance from the UN or any of its agencies\u201d. \u201cThe UN and many of its member states, including Australia, voted for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza that would only help Hamas to reorganize \u2013 a resolution that again failed to condemn Hamas, and again failed to call for the release of all hostages,\u201d Maimon wrote on X on Friday. \u201cNow, listening to the most recent remarks by Australian officials, it seems that Hamas\u2019s culpability has been forgotten \u2013 along with the fate of tens of thousands of displaced Israelis and the starvation of Israeli hostages in Gaza.\u201d Maimon did not directly name Wong, but the minister on Thursday noted estimates from the UN \u201cthat 400,000 Palestinians in Gaza are actually starving and a million are at risk of starvation\u201d. Wong also noted that \u201can estimated 1.7 million people in Gaza are internally displaced and there are increasingly few safe places for Palestinians to go\u201d. She said thousands of UNRWA employees were \u201cworking on the humanitarian response in the most trying of conditions\u201d. The Australian government has repeatedly condemned Hamas for the killing of about 1,200 people in southern Israel on 7 October and the taking of hostages. When voting with more than 150 countries in favour of a humanitarian ceasefire motion at the UN general assembly in December, the Australian government renewed calls for the release of hostages and for Hamas to surrender. The government has said it supports Israel\u2019s right to defend itself but that this must be in line with international law. More than 27,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its military operations with the stated intent to \u201cdestroy\u201d Hamas, according to estimates from the Gaza health ministry. Dutton took aim at Wong on Friday, accusing her of ignoring earlier warnings from Jewish community leaders about the risk of funding to UNRWA being misused. \u201cNow, if the foreign minister is directing Australian taxpayers\u2019 money to an organisation known to be a front or affiliated or associated with a terrorist organisation, her job is completely untenable,\u201d Dutton told reporters in Melbourne. \u201cIf the prime minister had the strength of leadership, he would stand up and say that Australian taxpayer money is not going to a terrorist organisation. \u201cIf Penny Wong is now advocating, knowing that this money is going to an organisation not fit-for-purpose, if that is her argument, then the prime minister should sack her.\u201d Wong has not, at any stage, advocated sending money to a terrorist organisation. A spokesperson for Wong said the foreign affairs minister had \u201cacted entirely within the law\u201d in responding to a \u201cdire humanitarian situation\u201d while Dutton was \u201cfocused on making false and exaggerated claims for a cheap political hit\u201d. Anthony Albanese said on Thursday that his government took \u201cthe allegations of breaches of UNRWA\u2019s neutrality very seriously\u201d and would \u201censure that every dollar that Australia contributes \u2026 goes to helping people on the ground who really need it\u201d.   Related: What is UNRWA and how dependent on western funding is its work in Gaza?    The Israeli government, which has long been critical of UNRWA, has argued the agency\u2019s problems go deeper than the allegations surrounding 7 October involvement and it should have no future role in Gaza. UNRWA schools have previously been accused of using textbooks that include antisemitic content. But aid groups wrote to Albanese and Wong on Friday warning that the \u201cdire situation in Gaza will rapidly escalate without UNRWA\u2019s critical support, with 2 million Palestinians facing starvation, imminent famine, and disease outbreak\u201d.

Passengers were left stranded at a handful of airports when Bonza \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d all services on Tuesday with no notice, as the airline\u2019s owners considered the viability of the business\u2019 future. Bonza appointed firm Hall Chadwick for the administration process of its operating and holding company, documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) show. Bonza\u2019s fleet has been grounded until the end of Thursday, with the administrators advising passengers with booking not to turn up to the airport. \u201cDiscussions are currently under way regarding the ongoing viability of the business,\u201d Bonza\u2019s chief executive, Tim Jordan, said in a statement. \u201cWe apologise to our customers who are impacted by this and we\u2019re working as quickly as possible to determine a way forward that ensures there is ongoing competition in the Australian domestic aviation market.\u201d Bonza\u2019s board held an emergency meeting on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the airline\u2019s next options.   Related: Purple budgie smugglers and Chekhov on tap as Bonza the \u2018bogan airline\u2019 finally takes to the skies    Shortly after the cancellations were reported, the transport minister, Catherine King, said her department had contacted Bonza and that \u201cour expectation is that they keep passengers informed of their options and their consumer rights\u201d. The transport department opened a hotline on Tuesday morning for stranded Bonza passengers. The hotline number is 1800 069 244. \u201cI have spoken to Qantas and Virgin CEOs this morning and both airlines stand ready to assist stranded passengers needing to get home,\u201d King said. Rex also offered to help with flights from regional airports. King, speaking later on Tuesday from Melbourne, did not answer questions about whether Bonza had asked for a government bailout, but said: \u201cWe\u2019ll await to hear what the Bonza board is deciding. \u201cIt\u2019s always really tough for a new entrant \u2026 We are a small market, despite the fact we are amazing travellers and we do want to travel everywhere and all the time. But we are a small market and it is always very difficult for new entrants,\u201d King said.

Bonza\u2019s private equity owners, the US firm 777 Partners, had owned the airline\u2019s fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes. The parent company also part owns the Canadian low-cost carrier Flair and leases its aircraft assets between the airlines. Flair had some of its aircraft repossessed at short notice in 2023. Bonza had been operating two aircraft wet-leased from Flair in recent months, in addition to its fleet of four aircraft. One of the planes Bonza had been leasing from Flair appears to have returned to the Canadian carrier and was flying routes in North America on Monday. On 9 April, AIP Capital \u2013 an investment manager that includes aviation assets such as aircraft and which had majority owned 777 Partners\u2019 fleet of aircraft in a 51%-49% split \u2013 announced the formation of a new holding company, Phoenix Aviation Capital. When announcing its launch, Phoenix said it had \u201ca definitive agreement to acquire the rights, interests and obligations of a portfolio of 30 737-8 aircraft from 777 Partners\u201d. In an internal note seen by Guardian Australia, Jordan acknowledged to staff that the airline\u2019s fleet was repossessed by AIP, the effective lessor of the aircraft, on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis was a surprise to both ourselves and 777 Partners. We are currently assessing all options and will provide an update here just as soon as we have more information available to share,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consequence of this all first wave flights from all bases have been cancelled.\u201d Bonza, 777 Partners and AIP Capital did not immediately respond to questions about aircraft repossessions. Guardian Australia has previously reported that 777 Partners were being chased in court in the UK for almost US$30m (A$44.7m) in unpaid aircraft leasing fees and damages. Despite the legal issues, 777 Partners is now attempting to take over English football club Everton. The proposed takeover is awaiting approval from the English Premier League. On Tuesday, the Transport Workers Union (TWU) was seeking an urgent meeting with Bonza to discuss the implications for workers during \u201cthis difficult and uncertain time\u201d. In addition to offering to fly stranded passengers for free, Qantas and Virgin offered support to Bonza aviation staff. Qantas has set up a dedicated section on Jetstar\u2019s jobs website to recruit Bonza staff. \u201cThis is an extremely distressing time for workers and stranded passengers. Bonza must ensure staff are prioritised and informed as this process plays out,\u201d the TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said. \u201cBonza and any other airline attempting to enter the Australian aviation market has little chance of survival,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite speculation of issues behind the scenes at Bonza, this is an industry dominated by aggressive competition and unchecked corporate greed that will squeeze out any new entrant.\u201d Kaine echoed his union\u2019s calls for a broader commission into aviation to address competition, consumer and worker issues. \u201cAviation is an industry on its knees,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cService standards have plummeted while air fares have gone through the roof. Regional jobs and communities are now at further risk of being cut off as a more cost-effective airline struggles to stay in the air.\u201d Launched in January 2023 after a lengthy accreditation process during which its planes could not fly, Bonza has struggled with aircraft shortages and was forced to cancel several routes over the past year.

The airline operates out of a base at Sunshine Coast airport and was set up to primarily serve the leisure market through direct routes between regional airports. The airline operates out of larger airports, including Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine and the Gold Coast. However, it had been critical of the laws governing Sydney airport. Those laws meant Bonza struggled to gain access to takeoff and landing slots to launch services in and out of the lucrative Sydney market.  Do you know more?

[2023-11-02T00:01:24Z]": "International students say a proposed levy on their studies could cause major damage to Australia\u2019s reputation and cement the idea individuals are used as \u201ccash cows\u201d for profit. The levy proposal, which would impose an export tax on international students, was raised in the Universities Accord interim report as a means to address calls for increased funding towards research and infrastructure. With the final report due to be handed down next month, here\u2019s what you need to know about why the proposal has divided the sector. What is the levy? The education minister, Jason Clare, has described the proposed levy as a \u201csovereign wealth fund\u201d that could protect the sector from future economic shocks and fund priority areas. The idea, akin to a GST on education, has been backed by institutions including the University of Newcastle, the University of Technology Sydney and James Cook University. Speaking on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing on Tuesday, Clare said the levy was \u201cone of about 70 ideas\u201d in the interim report released in July. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic money tree here, and so we\u2019ve got to look at how we do it, and this is just one of the ideas in that report,\u201d he said. How would it work? Two levies already exist on international students \u2013 relatively small sums to fund specific government services that support international students and providers. What\u2019s different about this levy is the fee stream would be much higher, and it\u2019s less clear how international students would benefit. Instead, it would collect funds from institutions that receive large incomes from international student fees and redistribute it to those that don\u2019t. Why has it been called for? Australia\u2019s universities have become increasingly reliant on cross-subsidising revenue with international student fees, with government expenditure on research and development among the lowest in the OECD. The University of Sydney received 38% of its income, or around $1.3bn, from international students in 2021. In its submission to the accord, the University of Newcastle argued the redistribution of funds was justified as \u201cinternational student income is Australia\u2019s third-largest export, contributing nearly 30% of sector revenue in 2019, however, it is primarily focussed in capital cities\u201d. The top five universities for international revenue are all prestigious Group of Eight (Go8) institutions in major cities, while the bottom five are all regional. The Greens say the levy is an excuse for the federal government to avoid increasing funding across the board. The party\u2019s education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, said: \u201cForcing international students to do the heavy lifting on higher education funding must end. \u201cThe government must properly fund our universities, not deter or punish students from studying here.\u201d What are the dangers? Policy experts have warned the levy poses a \u201cmajor risk\u201d of reputational damage to the sector that would \u201cseriously undermine\u201d diplomatic achievements and dissuade international students from studying in Australia. A report published by the Melbourne Centre for the Study of Higher Education said the levy would \u201cexacerbate negative sentiments among international students that they are seen as \u2018cash cows\u2019\u201d. The Property Council of Australia\u2019s student accommodation council, the Australian Business Deans Council, Queensland University of Technology and the Go8 universities have similarly expressed their concern it would damage Australia\u2019s reputation as an international student destination. Australia also already collects a large amount of revenue from the international student sector, including more than $2.6bn per year on post-study work visas alone. At the same time, international students and post-study work visa holders are ineligible for most public services including healthcare, welfare and concession cards. Gwilym Croucher, a higher academic researcher at the University of Melbourne and co-author of the report, said Australia had to be careful about what signals it sent international students. \u201cThe decision to study overseas is not taken lightly \u2013 if we want to welcome them, we must be welcoming,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a big change in the way we do things and the devil is in the detail \u2013 in the short term we may end up finding we have to reduce things, including the size of the workforce. \u201cThere might not be anything else [internationally] that looks like it.\u201d What do students think? International students have voiced strong opposition to the levy. In an open letter, the Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association (Supra), which represents international students, said the levy would \u201cerode [student] wellbeing\u201d and place an additional strain on individuals facing economic pressures. Its president, international student Weihong Liang, said the levy was another burden on a cohort already paying fees higher than domestic students and taxes to study. \u201cIt won\u2019t be linked to our educational experience, so it\u2019s unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks really bad. We\u2019ve come here to study, not as customers, it\u2019s not good for cohesion or inclusivity, and it\u2019s bad culturally. \u201cNo one [on the accord panel] asked any questions of us. It\u2019s hard to find anything impressive in the interim report about how to improve the international experience.\u201d When can we expect the accord? The Universities Accord ministerial reference group is holding its final meeting on Thursday before the report is handed down in December. The federal government will publicly respond early next year. What comes from the report is hailed to bring the greatest reform to the university sector in more than a decade. Clare told Guardian Australia it included a range of different ideas \u2013 \u201csome big, some small, some uncontroversial, some a bit spiky\u201d. \u201cI have been clear that government can\u2019t fund everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do everything. But I\u2019m asking the accord panel to tell us what are the top priorities that we should try to implement now and over the next 10 years and how do we fund them.\u201d", "Queensland health boss resigns amid criticism of proposed whistleblower law change [2023-06-28T03:37:37Z]": "The Queensland Health boss will step down from his role at the end of this month amid ongoing criticism of proposed changes to whistleblower laws made by the department. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, confirmed on Wednesday that Shaun Drummond, the director general of Queensland Health, had written her a letter confirming his resignation after being in the role for less than a year. The premier said he had done \u201can excellent job as the head of the department\u201d and clarified that it was his decision to resign. \u201cI thank him for his service to Queenslanders. It is a very, very difficult job. And he has served very well in that position,\u201d she told reporters. Palaszczuk also said she supported whistleblowers being able to come forward with reports. Earlier this week, the Sunday Mail reported on a submission by Queensland Health to the inquiry into public interest disclosure laws that suggested whistleblowers who provide journalists with \u201cinappropriate\u201d information should be penalised. After days of negative headlines, Drummond attempted to distance himself from his department\u2019s suggestions in a letter to the Courier-Mail. He said the submission about the laws had not come from him personally and he did not aim to restrict press freedom.

As attorney general, Fentiman said last year she was committed to extending the laws to the state\u2019s corruption body. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday in her new role as health minister, Fentiman backed Drummond and said he had her support. \u201cI have confidence with the director general and, as I said, so far the department have been responsive to my priorities as a new minister in terms of tackling ambulance ramping and pressures on our hospital system,\u201d she said. Fentiman clarified she had been clear in the media she did not support penalties for the disclosure of information to journalists.

The \u201cstatement of intent\u201d, announced on Wednesday by education minister, Jason Clare, would increase funding for Western Australian public schools by $1.6bn over the next five years, with $770m coming from the commonwealth. \u201cFully funded\u201d refers to the school resource standard (SRS), which estimates how much public funding a school needs to meet students\u2019 needs. Under the statement of intent, the federal government would increase its public school funding from 20% of the SRS to 22.5%, with the state government to lift its own funding by an equivalent amount to reach 100%.

But the Australian Education Union (AEU) president, Correna Haythorpe, said the deal was \u201cnot good enough\u201d.

This has been going on for far too long \u2013 the hero moment needs to be now.\u201d When questioned over the 4% tax on Wednesday, Western Australia\u2019s minister for education, Tony Buti, said it had \u201calways been considered\u201d as part of the funding agreement, adding \u201cevery other state does it\u201d. The 4% depreciation tax equated to around $230m of WA\u2019s funding share in 2023. \u201cThat 4% goes to ensuring that we have a quality education,\u201d Buti said. Haythorpe said his comments were \u201ccomplete rubbish\u201d, adding that former shadow minister for education Tanya Plibersek had described the tax as \u201caccounting tricks\u201d before the federal election.

He said fully funding all public schools would require both the commonwealth and the states \u201cchipping in\u201d, adding the WA agreement was \u201cjust the first step\u201d. Clare declined to comment on whether Labor would remove the 4% tax loophole as promised prior to the election, or whether he would consider further lifting the commonwealth share of funding. Education ministers in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, ACT and South Australia as well as Liberal-led Tasmania have rejected WA\u2019s deal, urging the federal government to increase its SRS funding share to 25% \u2013 a call backed by the AEU and the Greens. Parliamentary Budget Office figures estimate a 5% increase by 2028 would cost just over $1.8bn.   Related: Australian children with disabilities \u2018struggling now more than ever\u2019, autism expert says    The Greens spokesperson for education, Senator Penny Allman-Payne, said the WA deal was \u201can agreement to keep public schools underfunded into the future.\u201d Even if this deal-to-make-a-deal produces actual funding reforms, the WA school system will only receive 96% of its bare minimum funding. \u201cIf this is the model that the federal education minister is looking to roll out to the rest of the country, then Labor is leaving 2.5 million public school kids short changed. Again.\u201d The convener of advocacy group Save our Schools, Trevor Cobbold, said while the deal was a significant step forward, it still let the state government \u201coff the hook\u201d. He said if the commonwealth was to increase its share of funding to 25%, it should be conditional on states getting rid of the 4% rule.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a benchmark for agreements with the other states,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true they\u2019re going to get to 100% [of funding] by 2025 or even 2029. \u201cThis is another deceit perpetrated by the government \u2026 a deliberate lie,\u201d he said. Cobbold noted the WA government had cut its funding share for public schools from 84.4% of the SRS when the last funding agreement was penned in 2018, to 75% in 2024. \u201cWA has agreed to start clawing back cuts to its share over the past five years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the commonwealth funding share at 22.5%, WA public schools will be funded at only 95.6% of their SRS in 2029. \u201cThe cumulative under-funding over five years will be about $1.6bn. This is not good enough, especially while WA private schools will remain over-funded to at least 2029.\u201d", "\u2018Very little has shifted\u2019: watch house case a major concern for First Nations group advising Queensland police [2023-09-18T15:00:34Z]": "A key adviser to the Queensland police on First Nations issues says more urgency is required to fix racism in the ranks, amid concerns the service has failed to address widespread cultural problems exposed by a commission of inquiry. Christine Thomas, the co-chair of the QPS First Nations advisory group, said the group \u201cholds great concern that little has changed\u201d since last year\u2019s inquiry found a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d had allowed a culture of sexism, racism, fear and silence to take hold unchecked.

Last week, Guardian Australia reported that officers recorded making \u201csickening\u201d racist comments in the Brisbane police watch house had kept their jobs and been dealt with under a controversial \u201clocal management resolution\u201d process that the inquiry exposed as failing to hold problematic officers to account. Thomas said communities needed to have faith \u201cthat those who do the wrong thing are held accountable, regardless of their rank\u201d. \u201cThe watch house recordings so clearly demonstrated with explicit detail the nature of the culture of racism,\u201d she said. \u201cThe outcome of these investigations further highlights that very little has shifted since the commission of inquiry despite the massive injection of resources \u2026 to implement these recommendations. \u201cThe outcome of this investigation is exactly why the commission of inquiry recommendation to set up an independent police integrity unit was made.

Thomas said the advisory group had presented the QPS with a proposal for a First Nations command \u201cwith a resourcing structure that enables capacity \u2013 feet on the ground \u2013 in each of the districts to work with local communities to develop the QPS cultural capability\u201d. \u201cAnything less than a substantial effort to co-design and co-implement local policing strategies will be more of the same old business-as-usual approach and we know this is not working,\u201d she said. Implementing the proposal would require the creation of several First Nations-identified positions. Thomas said there were so few senior First Nations police officers in the organisation that of 12,000 police, the QPS could not find seven Indigenous people eligible for promotion to inspector. \u201cThat in itself is a crisis they need to be moving to fix,\u201d Thomas said. The QPS responded to questions from Guardian Australia last week, including to suggestions by Longbottom that senior officers had been \u201chostile\u201d towards dealing with real issues.   Related: The startling evidence of racism Queensland police couldn\u2019t shrug off | Ten years of Guardian Australia    The response sought to argue that the group had been valued by pointing to the fact that Thomas represented the group at the inaugural QPS First Nations award night in Cairns. \u201cIt is this type of inclusion the commissioner believes is critical to ensure positive and meaningful change for the organisation.\u201d When asked about the response, Thomas said it exposed a major part of the problem: that police view engagement with Indigenous people as \u201cperformative\u201d rather than seeking to collaborate or co-design reform, or address serious issues. \u201cAttendance at an awards night is not an affirmative action that\u2019s going to result in systemic reform,\u201d she said. \u201cThe QPS needs to act with integrity and transparency and be highly visible in moving beyond performative gestures to taking real and substantial action to address these issues. \u201cUntil the community see that this is in fact happening, the QPS will continue to struggle with recruitment and retention. There are many highly educated and valuable First Nations people who are willing to serve their communities, but they will not work for an organisation that is culturally unsafe.\u201d The QPS said in a statement that the commissioner \u201cremains committed to working together with all members of the [advisory group] to continue to build trust and enhance policing practices with First Nations peoples and communities in Queensland\u201d.Police said the First Nations awards night \u201cwas only one example\u201d of initiatives underway \u201cto tackle complex issues and drive meaningful change\u201d. \u201cThe commissioner has always been candid that these relationships will take time to build meaningful trust and respect, however, the QPS is committed to the journey and is very proud of its ongoing work with the [advisory group].\u201d", "The Greens have proposed a truth and justice commission.

It would be required to report its findings and recommendations within four years. \n \n  Related: Anthony Albanese open to Makarrata commission for truth and treaty for Indigenous Australians  \n \nIt would also have coercive power to compel a witness to attend a hearing, to give evidence and to produce documents, and could issue search warrants. \nWhat has the government said about it? \nThe bill was referred to the joint committee with Labor support in the Senate. \nSince the failed referendum, the government\u2019s line has been that it is taking time to consult on the way forward in Indigenous policy. \nIn the Uluru statement from the heart, which on election night Anthony Albanese committed to implementing \u201cin full\u201d, a Makarrata commission was proposed to oversee a process of treaty making and truth telling. \nMakarrata is a Yolngu word from northeast Arnhem Land, meaning \u201ccoming together after a struggle\u201d. \nBut that was contingent on a successful public vote to set up the voice to parliament. \nLast month, Albanese said he\u2019d go to the Garma festival in Arnhem Land again this August to talk to Yolngu leaders. \n\u201cI\u2019ll \u2026 sit down with people and talk about a way forward. One of the things that we wanted to do, the whole point of the voice, was listening to people in communities, rather than people in Canberra making decisions going forward, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Albanese said in June. \nThe Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, said the government was committed to the principles of truth-telling and Makarrata, but that there were a \u201cvariety of views on how to move forward\u201d. \n\u201cI\u2019ll look at the detail of Senator Cox\u2019s proposal,\u201d Burney told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the next steps bring people together. After the referendum, we are taking the time to listen and get things right.\u201d \nStates and territories have processes under way, Burney said. \nWhat are those processes? \nThe nation\u2019s first and foremost truth-telling process is the Yoorrook justice commission in Victoria. It began in 2022 with a mandate to investigate and record the injustices experienced by First Nations people in Victoria since colonisation. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nYoorrook, modelled on South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid commission, has the same powers as a royal commission to subpoena documents and summon witnesses. Yoorrook is expected to deliver its final report in 2025. It has heard from everyone from the premier, Jacinta Allan, to the descendants of massacre perpetrators. \nQueensland\u2019s truth-telling and healing inquiry began on Monday 1 July. Led by Waanyi-Kalkadoon barrister Joshua Creamer, its aim is \u201ca healed and reconciled Queensland based upon a shared understanding of a full and complete history.\u201d \nBut the Queensland process may be short-lived. The conservative opposition, now ahead in the polls, said it will abolish the inquiry if it\u2019s elected in October. The Liberal National leader, David Crisafulli, said the inquiry would just \u201cfuel further division\u201d in the aftermath of the failed voice referendum. \n \n  Related: Inside Australia\u2019s first truth-telling commission \u2013 podcast  \n \nOther states and territories have been ambivalent about truth and treaty processes. \nThe Northern Territory treaty commission\u2019s final report in 2022 recommended the establishment of a three-year independent truth commission. There was little movement until April, when the NT attorney general, Chansey Paech, said it was time to be \u201cfearless\u201d about taking the next steps. Paech said he hopes to finalise a treaty or treaties within the next term of government if he is reelected at the August vote. \nIn Tasmania, the 2021 Pathway to Truth-telling and Treaty report looked at forms of truth telling in the state. An advisory group was appointed in December 2022 but there is \u201cno set timeframe or predetermined outcome for this work\u201d, according to the Tasmanian government. \nNSW is going ahead with treaty consultations. It has just put out a call for treaty commissioners who would have two years to consult across Aboriginal communities before delivering a report on their findings. \nNSW set aside $5m in the September 2023 budget to fund this stage of the process, but the Aboriginal affairs minister, David Harris, said it was in its infancy. \n\u201cThis is not a discussion about what would be in a treaty, it would be about a process for having that conversation,\u201d Harris said in April. \n \n  Related: The man leading the biggest murder investigation in Queensland\u2019s history  \n \nThe NSW premier, Chris Minns, has also been careful to say that \u2018any next steps towards reconciliation\u2019 would be put to the people of NSW at the next election in early 2027. \nWhat exactly is truth telling? \nTruth telling is activities or processes that seek to give a fuller account of Australia\u2019s colonial history and its ongoing legacy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. \nThe broader concept of truth telling emerged in the late 20th century \u2013 particularly in places where countries were transitioning from civil war and dictatorships to democracy \u2013 from the idea that \u201ctransitional justice\u201d could be reached via commissions and other public processes that allowed oppressed peoples to tell their experiences. \nThere have been prominent public processes in South Africa, Uganda, Rwanda and Northern Ireland, as well as Timor-Leste in 2001, and Canada\u2019s monumental truth and reconciliation commission from 2008 to 2015. \nNot all of these processes have led to substantive change. And not everyone is in favour of the commission model, with some advocating localised, \u201cbottom up\u201d approaches designed by Indigenous people, like the annual Myall Creek massacre memorial. \n\u201cRevisiting trauma is not the road to justice for Aboriginal people,\u201d the UNSW law professor and architect of the Uluru statement, Megan Davis, wrote in the Monthly in 2021. \u201cAustralian history is replete with examples of the commonwealth detaching justice outcomes from \u2018truth\u2019.\u201d \nHow would it work? \nBeing \u201crealistic\u201d about what truth telling can achieve is important, according to a 2024 study by academics at the University of NSW. \nThe purpose of truth-telling needed to be clear from the outset, they said. It could be done for healing, to seek justice, or to educate Australians about the fuller history of colonisation. \nIn their report for Reconciliation Australia about the \u201cbarriers and enablers\u201d of truth telling, they found a significant gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians in what they understood truth telling to be, and their role in it. \nThe report said truth telling needed to be led by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities, recognise the continuing impacts of the past on their lives today, be ongoing and aim to achieve lasting change. \nPeople needed to feel safe to speak \u2013 and to listen, they said. \n\u201cTruth-telling may involve difficult emotions and the potential for conflict, and strategies need to be put in place to manage these,\u201d a co-author, Gomeroi Prof Heidi Norman, from the Indigenous Land and Justice Research Group in the UNSW School of Humanities &amp; Languages, said. \nThe report found that while there was wide agreement among Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians that truth telling was an essential step forward, they held different understandings and assumptions that \u201cwill need to be carefully navigated\u201d. \n\u201cTruth telling is not a panacea that will fix every problem facing Indigenous communities,\u201d the co-lead researcher Dr Anne Maree Payne said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s one step that is part of a bigger journey towards recognition and reconciliation, not a destination in itself.\u201d", "Queensland Indigenous truth-telling inquiry will be able to force police to give evidence [2023-05-10T09:05:03Z]": "Queensland\u2019s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry will have the power to force the state\u2019s police commissioner to give evidence under legislative changes passed in parliament.

A repeat now would cost $7.4bn, Australian insurers say [2023-09-12T15:00:34Z]": "A repeat of Australia\u2019s worst disasters such as Cyclone Tracy and Sydney\u2019s giant hailstorm in 1999 would hit the economy much harder now, given increased population and the rising costs of rebuilding, the Insurance Council of Australia has said. The assessment, contained in this year\u2019s insurance catastrophe resilience report, found that Tracy \u2013 which killed 71 people and caused $200m in insured losses when it struck Darwin in 1974 \u2013 would cause $7.4bn in losses if repeated today. If adjusted only for inflation, the cost would have been $1.78bn. Sydney\u2019s hailstorm, which cost $1.7bn in insured losses in April 1999, would land a damage bill of $8.85bn if an equivalent event struck now. Had inflation changes only been taken into account, the bill would have been $3.28bn.   Related: Fears many Australians will abandon home insurance as premiums jump 50% in high-risk areas    Both tallies exceed the $6bn paid out by insurers for the 2022 floods in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales, currently Australia\u2019s costliest disaster. The revised data, modelled by Risk Frontiers, adjusted costs for inflation, changes in property numbers and values and tougher building codes. ICA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Hall, said soaring costs associated with extreme events \u2013 even before global heating was factored in \u2013 should be considered in debates about population growth, especially in the eastern states.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to think about housing that population in safe, durable and insurable homes,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re just setting ourselves up for large costs moving forward, particularly in a changed climate, and it impacts everybody in the insurance market.\u201d Insurers paid out $1.6bn in claims for the year to June, or just 22% of the record tally for the previous 12 months of $7.28bn. Hall, though, said insurers were still trying to recapitalise balance sheets after taking a battering over three La Ni\u00f1a years and consumers shouldn\u2019t anticipate lower premiums.   Related: Insurance firms must lower premiums as government funds disaster prevention, minister says    Reinsurance costs have this year risen to 20-year highs, pushing up Australian insurers\u2019 costs by 20-30%. \u201cAustralia has been traditionally thought about as a good diversified risk for reinsurance globally,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last decade, what we\u2019ve seen is reinsurers have reassessed the risk factors in the Australian market and the prices have changed accordingly. \u201cThe cost of rebuilding has gone up enormously,\u201d Hall said, adding insurers were also having to hire and retain more staff to cater for large surges in claims. Australia already had a notably variable climate \u2013 particularly for rainfall \u2013 even before climate shifts take effect in a warming world. Rising premiums after disasters are also increasingly putting insurance out of the reach of many Australians. The Albanese government announced in its first budget last October a five-year, $1bn disaster-ready fund for mitigation infrastructure that was matched by the states and territories. Those funds were inadequate to meet the \u201cenormous\u201d requirements to make at-risk communities more resilient, Hall said. Spending on property buybacks and improving infrastructure after the Queensland and NSW northern rivers floods alone would cost $1.5bn, he said.   Related: After the floods: Eugowra awaits the insurance payouts that may not come    \u201cThere will be another dozen regions around Australia that would require at least that level of investment when it comes to flood protection and mitigation,\u201d Hall said. \u201cThat\u2019s excluding western Sydney, which is our largest, unmitigated flood risk in Australia.\u201d The median home insurance cost last year was $1,894. Cyclone-exposed Northern Territory was the most expensive, while taxes inflated those in NSW. South Australia\u2019s premiums were the lowest. Some perils, such as flooding, were more predictable in their location if not in their intensity and timing. Risks could be reduced by enforcing planning limits and, in some cases, buying out properties in hazardous zones. For others, such as hailstorms, home builders should consider using thicker steel roofing than is often chosen now as one way to reduce rebuilding costs. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a certain thickness then the hail usually compromises [it] and the whole roof has to be replaced,\u201d Hall said. \u201cEventually someone\u2019s going to have to pay for the upgrade when the worst happens.\u201d     ", "\u2018It\u2019s very unfair\u2019: Australia\u2019s visa crackdown is disrupting international students and hitting university finances [2024-05-05T02:00:03Z]": "It took Rajesh more than 12 months to receive his visa to study in Australia.

The federal government has announced a series of reforms, including tougher visa conditions, stronger English-language tests and rules for education agents who bring overseas students to Australia. The latest home affairs data shows the proportion of offshore student visa applications being refused has reached a record high, with as many as one in five students having their visas rejected in the year to March. Visas granted to Indian students fell by 48% between December 2022 and December 2023, with Nepalese visas granted falling 53% and Pakistani visas falling 55% over the same period.  The department cites an increase in incomplete applications and fraudulent documentation, contributing to both higher visa refusal rates and longer processing times. The tougher visa conditions have prompted institutions to change their policies, with some even imposing blanket bans on Indian students.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, says the federal government recognises \u201cchange is hard\u201d but migration is \u201ctoo high\u201d and must be brought back to \u201csustainable levels\u201d. \u201cWe are working with the sector to help providers adapt, but we must restore integrity to the system to protect the sector\u2019s international reputation,\u201d she says. But some say the approach is having a financial impact on institutions and disrupting the plans of genuine students who may be turned off studying in Australia altogether. What\u2019s going on? The founder and president of the Pakistani Students Association of Australia, Zeeshan Malik, says many offshore students are experiencing visa refusals, while others are scared to travel back home lest their visas be cancelled on return to Australia. While there have not been any reported cases of students having their visas cancelled on return, Malik says students feel they are being discriminated against based upon their country of origin. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair,\u201d he says. \u201cLots of students are struggling with mental health and other issues because of these confusing policies.\u201d A University of Sydney spokesperson says a \u201csignificant number\u201d of students have been forced to defer or withdraw their applications due to visa processing delays, while others have been suspended to fulfil additional requirements. \u201cThis has been very disruptive to highly capable young people from around the world who had paid their visa application fee and chosen to come to Australia for their studies,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cWe have moved our last date to apply for semester 2 to try to limit any such impact for future students.\u201d    The University of Melbourne has also \u201cfaced challenges\u201d this semester, with a number of students yet to receive their visas for the 2024 intake. A spokesperson says it has provided an extension to allow enrolled international students to start later. Central Queensland University has gone even further, writing to education agents confirming it will no longer offer English language programs to students from India or Nepal, or enrolments to applicants over 25 or married, except for research placements. \u201cWith many universities witnessing an increase in student visa refusals, it has been necessary for CQUniversity to proactively reconsider admissions requirements on a regular basis,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cWe have a moral obligation to ensure that prospective students have the best opportunity to successfully obtain a student visa. \u201cSuch an outcome is not good for the student, the university, or the reputation of Australia as a global study destination.\u201d Why universities are imposing blanket bans Phil Honeywood, the chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA), says stigmatising entire nations is a \u201cblunt instrument\u201d that ignores the benefits of diversity. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be a welcoming, safe nation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame sometimes blunt policy instruments go against other government policies.\u201d Honeywood says universities are imposing restrictive measures on international students in the hope it will improve their risk ratings, which are used by the federal government to reduce student numbers. The system assesses universities based upon how likely they are to recruit non-genuine students who arrive in Australia primarily to work, not study. Visas are given a risk rating between 1 and 3, and only low-risk universities on level 1 have visa applications processed quickly. Earlier this month, the list was updated, with nine universities downgraded to a level 2 and two downgraded to a level 3. According to Honeywood, less than 10% of international student visas are waiting to be approved at low-risk universities while universities at level 2 and 3 are facing extensive delays. During a webinar hosted by the IEAA at the beginning of the university year, Charles Sturt University\u2019s pro-chancellor, international, Mike Ferguson, said 40% of international students enrolled in his university \u2013 which is a level 2 \u2013 were still waiting on visa decisions in the first week of the semester. \u201cSpeaking to my colleagues at other universities, I know many others are in similar situations,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at refusal rates for offshore students in most markets in the region of 50%.\u201d    Level 3 institution Federation University has faced significant budget pressure since the migration crackdown. It recently announced plans to cut 200 ongoing positions \u2013 the equivalent of just over one in 10 staff members. A spokesperson for the university said the announcement came in response to a 49% decline in international student numbers between 2019 and 2023, which had been exacerbated by \u201cunexpected but necessary changes to international student visa arrangements\u201d. Similarly, the University of Tasmania \u2013 also at level 3 \u2013 announced last month it would sell two of its Hobart hotels intended to house international students in anticipation of declining numbers. Private institutions have also been hit hard. According to English Australia, the national peak body for more than 100 English language colleges for international students, visa grants plummeted by 68% in December 2023 compared with the previous year. What the future holds The share of international students is likely to decrease further with an anticipated hike in student visa fees in the May budget, making Australia \u201cwell and truly\u201d the most expensive country to apply for a non-refundable visa, according to Honeywood. Honeywood says international students are facing a \u201cblame game\u201d as the only migration market to Australia that can feasibly be reduced. The former immigration department deputy secretary Abul Rizvi agrees. He says while higher visa fees are likely, it will be \u201cpoor long-term policy\u201d. \u201cIt will mostly deter high-performing students who have options of going elsewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cPolicy must be designed to encourage and reward providers to compete for the best students not just those who can apparently afford to pay.\u201d Rizvi says the cautious approach being taken by providers, coupled with the ramping up of refusal rates for offshore student applications, led to a big fall in student visa applications in February and a fall in net student arrivals in March. \u201cThat trend will likely continue over the next few months,\u201d he says. \u201cBut while the flow of students is slowing, the stock is still rising and is now well over a record 700,000,\u201d he says, referring to the number of international students in Australia. \u201cThe industry is built on continuous growth. Under the risk rating system, lower tier providers are particularly vulnerable. They are the ones complaining the most.\u201d To Rajesh, the decline in quality lies squarely with universities and the government. \u201cStudents are not responsible for that,\u201d he says. \u201cBlaming everything on students and their respective countries is not solving the problem.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 May 2024 because Mike Ferguson is Charles Sturt University\u2019s pro-chancellor, international, not vice-chancellor of the university as an earlier version said.", "Rare blue supermoon to light up Monday night sky, leaving stargazers over the moon [2024-08-19T05:15:59Z]": "The world will see a rare blue supermoon this week, with stargazers getting a glimpse on Monday night into Tuesday morning. \nThe moon will appear about a seventh bigger and brighter on Monday evening as a blue moon and super moon coincide. \nWhat is a supermoon? \nThe moon travels around Earth in an orbit that is not quite circular, so there is a single point in its orbit that is closest to Earth as well as a point that is furthest away. \nThe moon normally sits about 384,000km from Earth but will be 23,000km closer on Monday night \u2013 almost double Earth\u2019s diameter. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nWhen the moon passes within that closest point while it is full or new, it appears biggest and brightest and a supermoon occurs. \nWhat is a blue moon? \nA blue moon happens every two to three years when there are two full moons within a single calendar month.

A local resident, Jason Murphy had reported items found in tanbark near a new playground at Donald McLean Reserve in Spotswood to the local council earlier this week. The Hobsons Bay city council, in Melbourne\u2019s west, confirmed the two pieces of material were sent for testing, with results on Wednesday confirming they contained asbestos. The playground has been closed since Tuesday. The council said it was \u201cconducting a thorough inspection of all open space and conservation areas where we have used recycled mulch from this specific supplier\u201d. Murphy, a Yarraville father-of-two, was visiting the park on Monday with his children when he made the discovery.  \u201cI was sitting under a tree near some mulch when I noticed a piece of wood still in it,\u201d he said.  \u201cI just thought, \u2018well that\u2019s weird, I wonder what else is here?\u2019 And then I found crunched-up building material, insulated wire and this white composite material.\u201d    In a statement, the council said it was working with a material hygienist and the state\u2019s Environment Protection Agency to ensure hazardous material was removed. \u201cThe safety of our community is our priority and Council is working with the EPA and the hygienist to inspect other sites using this mulch,\u201d the council said in a statement. \u201cAll playgrounds within Hobsons Bay are regularly inspected by a safety auditor, which also includes new reserves prior to them being opened.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The council said the asbestos material was discovered in a recycled mulch product around mature tree-planting. A \u201cvirgin soft mulch\u201d is also used around the playground. It came after Victoria\u2019s EPA conducted precautionary inspections of commercial mulch producers after asbestos was found in the soil of a Sydney park, which led to more discoveries in New South Wales and Queensland. The agency inspected 59 producers in Victoria, and said on Wednesday no traces of asbestos was found in their garden mulch products.   Related: NSW to double penalties for worst environmental crimes in wake of asbestos crisis    While most producers had good systems and processes to ensure clean mulch, six were required to strengthen their controls to prevent contamination from occurring. Free garden mulch from popular online marketplaces has also come to the attention of the environment watchdog after a resident in Heathmont, in Melbourne\u2019s east, received mulch containing building rubble and asbestos. The EPA said this highlighted why garden mulch should only be obtained from reliable sources where quality checks are enforced. \u201cI urge the community to watch out for anyone offering garden mulch who can\u2019t demonstrate they follow appropriate high standards and quality checks to avoid contamination,\u201d the agency\u2019s director of regulatory services, Duncan Pendrigh, said on Wednesday. Asbestos testing was triggered after fragments of bonded asbestos were detected in Sydney\u2019s Rozelle Parklands. At least 75 sites, including parks and schools, have since been confirmed to be contaminated with traces of the materials. Queensland authorities have identified at least 90 sites for investigation after contaminated mulch was taken from two stockpiles. The EPA has taken legal action against four Victorian individuals or businesses over the mishandling of asbestos in the current financial year. Businesses found guilty of mishandling the material face penalties of up to $2m.", "Australian effort to contain fire ants hampered by funding shortfall, documents show [2023-08-06T20:00:20Z]": "Lack of proper funding is hindering efforts to contain the spread of invasive fire ants by Australian authorities, according to documents obtained by the Invasive Species Council. The documents show a stark contrast between the original $133m plan to fully eradicate the ants and an $89m \u201crevised work plan\u201d to continue for the next 12 months. This revised plan would only treat half the area needed, even as the ants continue their southward march towards New South Wales. Under the original plan, authorities would have carried out an eradication program of surveillance and treatment, including establishing a 10km horseshoe around the entire fire ant infestation, including the Moreton Bay, Somerset Regional, Lockyer Valley, Scenic Rim and Gold Coast council areas.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  However under the revised plan, work will take place only across a 5km strip in the Scenic Rim and Gold Coast council areas south of Brisbane, with no systematic eradication program taking place in other council areas. Additionally, the surveillance target will be reduced from 17% to 8% of the area with only a limited public awareness and compliance campaign to be carried out. Treatment rounds on the Gold Coast will also be reduced from three to two.

Reece Pianta of the Invasive Species Council said the window to properly address the problem was \u201crapidly closing\u201d and if the ants were to reach New South Wales it would become much harder to contain the problem and increase the risk of a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d where they reached the Murray-Darling Basin area. \u201cThis is the result of bureaucratic penny-pinching,\u201d Pianta said. \u201cWe know governments are committed but what we suspect is bureaucratic hold-ups are delaying the money from reaching the ground where it\u2019s required. \u201cWe think that historically the fire ant program has sought the amount of money they thought they could get and not the amount of money they needed.

The ministers aren\u2019t expected to sign off on a new national strategy to tackle fire ants until next year, after the states prepare each of their individual budgets. So far only Queensland and NSW have committed their share of funding for the program. Queensland has pledged $61m and NSW has set aside $95m, for 26.3% of the total needed to properly fund the work.

They were used legitimately. There is no element of corruption.\u201d Australia funded PNG\u2019s humanitarian program through a contract signed in 2021 by the then Morrison government, which was kept secret at the time and the details of which the Albanese government still refuses to reveal. The agreement was to provide accommodation, health and other support services for refugees exiled to PNG by Australia as part of the offshore detention regime formerly run on Manus Island, before that centre was ordered shut by the PNG supreme court. Most of the 64 remaining refugees and asylum seekers \u2013 the final cohort from the Manus detention centre \u2013 have been held in PNG for a decade and are in poor physical and mental health. Money for the support program came from Australia\u2019s $303m irregular maritime arrival \u201coffshore management\u201d budget and was sent to PNG\u2019s immigration and citizenship authority, which paid PNG private contractors to provide accommodation, groceries, medical care and transport to refugees and asylum seekers. But with slower-than-expected resettlement \u2013 in part due to Covid travel restrictions \u2013 the Australian money has essentially run out and the services required to support the refugees and asylum seekers have been cut or drastically reduced. Some refugees have been threatened with eviction from their accommodation. Several PNG businesses, including motels where refugees are housed, transport companies and security firms, are owed millions of dollars. One Port Moresby hospital is owed nearly $40m. In a letter sent to Rosso, the whistleblower alleged widespread corruption within the program \u2013 particularly surrounding the hiring of cars. He claimed private vehicles were \u201ccross-hired\u201d so as to disguise the beneficiaries of contracts, and relatives of senior officials were allowing their private vehicles to be hired through a front company, then claiming a personal benefit.

Originally agreed in 2012, the plan aimed to recover 2,750 gigalitres a year with an additional 450 GL/y from efficiency measures. But it won\u2019t \u201cbe implemented on time or on budget\u201d, with delays inflating costs even as the climate crisis adds to challenges, the commission\u2019s interim review of the plan\u2019s implementation has found. The review was also critical of previous Coalition governments. The decision to switch from open tenders to \u201climited\u201d ones was \u201ca slower way to recover large volumes of water\u201d, with \u201cweak transparency\u201d for amounts paid between 2016 and 2019.    \u201cThis report confirms what we already knew, that after a decade of sabotage under the Liberals and Nationals, the Murray-Darling basin plan is off track,\u201d said the water minister, Tanya Plibersek. \u201cMore than 80% of the water recovered under the plan so far has been under federal Labor governments.\u201d Plibersek\u2019s office separately released the results of a buyback scheme to recover 44.3 GL across six catchments in New South Wales and Queensland. The tender attracted about 250 responses to sell about twice as much water as offered.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cThis is a fantastic signal to governments and communities that voluntary water purchase is a necessary and feasible tool to help meet the targets of the Murray-Darling basin plan,\u201d Plibersek said. In September the Albanese government introduced legislation to postpone the full implementation of the plan from June 2024 to the end of 2026. The move had the support of the NSW, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory but not Victoria.   Related: Labor\u2019s Murray-Darling Basin water buyback plan would trigger wave of job losses, farmers warn    The urgency of diverting water use to ensure the environmental health of the basin\u2019s rivers, lakes and wetlands will probably intensify as drought conditions spread across the food bowl region. Even if the \u201cRestoring Our Rivers\u201d bill is legislated the new pact won\u2019t be enough to implement the plan in full, the Productivity Commission said. \u201cWeak accountability and other underlying risks to basin plan implementation remain,\u201d it said. \u201cExisting funding is also not sufficient.\u201d As of May, the government had $2.168bn of its committed $9.119bn funding still to spend, the commission said. Among recovery programs, \u201cpurchasing water is by far the quickest and most cost-effective way for governments to obtain water entitlements for environmental use\u201d, it found. \u201cBy contrast, recovering water through water-use efficiency infrastructure projects, both on-farm and off-farm, are more than twice as expensive on average, and can delay \u2013 rather than prevent \u2013 structural adjustment,\u201d it said. The current off-farm projects being contracted cost an average $14,800 a megalitre. Projects that were aimed to deliver 605 GL/year in water savings were likely to fall 190\u2013315 GL/year short if reconciliation against targets takes place before June 2024. Only about half of the 36 measures are expected to be operating.    Similarly, the program to recover an additional 450 GL/year of water via efficiency measures had recovered just 26 GL/year. Noting widespread concern in farming regions that buybacks reduce economic activity, the commission said governments had to increase support for communities. It also proposed a new government-owned corporate entity to operate at arm\u2019s length from governments as one option to ensure effective implementation of the plan. The failure of governments to meet water recovery targets meant delivery costs \u201cwill be considerably higher than first estimated\u201d, with rising water and construction costs over the past 15 years, the commission said.    Climate climate would add \u201can ongoing challenge\u201d to water management with the basin expected to get hotter and drier, with more frequent and severe droughts and floods, and greater variability. \u201cThere should be more clarity about how the climate change objectives are measured and assessed,\u201d the report said. Basin governments should also publicly report on how water resource plans deliver on First Nations objectives and outcomes, and strengthen the capacity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to engage in plan activities, the review said.", "Australia taxes its massive gas exports so weakly that we pay more on Hecs than companies do on PRRT | Greg Jericho [2024-02-28T14:00:14Z]": "In Hollywood everyone knows never to ask for a percentage of the film profits.

In the 2000s we exported around 14m tonnes of LNG a year. Now, due to the opening of the Gladstone LNG terminal, we send 83mt overseas \u2013 the second most of any nation. More production equals more revenue thus surely more profit (even if the margins remain the same) and thus more tax \u2013 after all, why would companies massively increase production if not to make more money? Given we have a mining tax for the gas industry called the petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT), the government surely is swimming in a money bin of gas tax revenue. Alas no:       If the graph does not display click here When Australia exported 15.4mt of LNG in 2008-09, the government raised $2.2bn in PRRT.

The gas industry pays less tax per barrel of gas produced now than any time going back 35 years. Who would have thought producing so much gas would destroy their profits.

Some on social media linked reducing classroom hours to the state\u2019s incendiary debate around youth crime, warning it would only give children \u201cmore time to get into mischief\u201d. Yet numerous schools \u2013 big and small, city and country, public and private \u2013 have already opted to amend their hours in order to better meet the needs of teachers, parents and students. Guardian Australia set about finding out what they had learned. \u2018So many benefits\u2019 Wendy Henning is a cattle and crop farmer whose four daughters were educated at Teelba \u2013 \u201ca unique little Queensland state school\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just a school in a paddock, it has a gun club community centre beside it, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Henning says. \u201cThere\u2019s no town, as such.\u201d Last year, the primary school had 17 students. Henning describes Teelba as \u201cin the middle of everywhere but not quite anywhere\u201d. Towns such as Roma, St George, Goondiwindi and Dalby are a minimum 90-minute drive each way, meaning children were being pulled out of school when their family had a doctor\u2019s appointment in town, or had to have the car serviced, or pick up tools. So 18 years ago, one of the six families who sent their children to Teelba suggested a nine-day fortnight to reduce absenteeism. The students would be in class for 45 minutes longer each day in exchange for taking one day off every two weeks. After sending four children through the nine-day model, Henning \u2013 who is now on the federal committee of the Isolated Children\u2019s Parents\u2019 Association \u2013 says there were \u201cso many benefits\u201d.    While the department is at pains to portray its reforms as modest, requests from a couple of schools for four-day weeks prompted fierce debate    Henning says before the community backed the proposal they needed the support of every family at the school \u2013 and that required a trial, evidence and annual review. \u201cIt had to be evidence-based,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd, very fortunately, that was what the evidence found: the children were still achieving and, in some cases, were achieving at higher levels.\u201d Attendance improved as families scheduled trips to town on those school-free weekdays. For Henning, it meant one less 60km round-trip to school a fortnight \u2013 which adds up, she says, over the 13 years she spent driving her girls to Teelba. There were benefits at home too. During periods of mustering or harvest, the spare day meant extra hands in the cattle yards or out in the fields. \u201cIt was an opportunity for the kids to be a part of the family business and the family dynamic,\u201d Henning says. \u201cIt is also really lovely for the older ones to have that extra day to be with their younger siblings.\u201d Prof Pasi Sahlberg says schools like Teelba are a \u201cbrilliant example\u201d of harnessing the \u201cwisdom of the community\u201d. \u201cSchools and their communities often know much better what works for them and how to run the school than the governments, often far away,\u201d says Sahlberg, a professor in educational leadership at the University of Melbourne.    While the evidence on whether flexible hours alone improve results in schools is mixed, Sahlberg says it is \u201cquite clear\u201d there is no correlation between the amount of time students spend in classrooms and what they get out of them. \u201cIn fact, it goes the other way around,\u201d he says. Australian students, he says, will on average spend more time in classrooms over the course of the schooling than students in any other OECD nation. They do not, however, top educational outcomes.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cSo the conversation has to move away from how many hours and minutes of instruction do children get,\u201d Sahlberg says. Instead, he says, schools should be asking themselves: what is the best way to arrange hours so that schools are \u201ca good place for everybody to be and where everybody is happy\u201d. \u201cThat will definitely influence the quality of education there.\u201d \u2018Making students more responsible\u2019 In the case of the 1,649-student Gap SHS, according to Williams, initial concerns among some in the school community have subsided. Her son, year 10 student Darcy, used his class-free time to get heavily involved in putting on a school musical. Called The Fungus, the show was based on a dystopian novel written by a student, reworked with a few more jokes and a musical score all produced by their classmates. Her daughter, Scarlett, walks to the home of a friend, where there is parent supervision, with a group of fellow year 8s. \u201cThey claim to be studying together,\u201d Williams says. But even if they are not, she adds, Scarlett\u2019s grades have not suffered and Williams is glad her daughter has time to cement friendships. Ninety minutes down the Pacific Motorway at Palm Beach Currumbin state high school, the story sounds remarkably similar. The Gold Coast school\u2019s P&amp;C president, Kaylee Campradt, says there were a \u201cfew mutterings\u201d about plans for its 2,594 students to have Monday afternoons free back in 2021. And, yes, there were \u201ca few teething problems\u201d when it was trialled the following year \u2013 not least of which was shoppers\u2019 surprise when hordes of schoolchildren descended on the local shopping centre early on a Monday afternoon. But Campradt says the school offered options to supervise younger students, such as her son, who was in year 7. \u201cHe could trot over to the primary school that he had just graduated from and join in programs to help the prep kids learn to read, which I think is just adorable,\u201d she says.  In the end, he mainly tries to knock off his week\u2019s worth of homework to free more time during the week to play basketball. His older sister, who is now in year 11, drives to school and is afforded more freedom. \u201cTo be honest, in the summertime, if that means she\u2019s going to the beach and having a swim before coming home, that\u2019s not a bad thing either,\u201d Campradt says.    Nearly two years in, the community has adapted, Campradt says \u2013 elderly people in the area know not to lunch at the shopping centre at 1.30pm on a Monday. For most parents, Monday afternoon is a non-issue. \u201cThose are just the hours we do school now,\u201d Campradt says. The changes in those two high schools embraced by the Williams and Campradt families are relatively modest, but what about a four-day week for senior students? Williams says, if done right, her family would be up for it. Like many, they saw, during the pandemic, that home-schooling could be done. \u201cI like the idea of making students and kids more responsible,\u201d she says. But, then, Williams runs her own business, her children are \u201cparticipation kids\u201d and she works closely with teachers \u2013 and sees how hard they are working. Considering the parents with more rigid work structures, more \u201cfree-range kids\u201d and less of an insight into how the teaching profession has changed, the Gap SHS mother is unsure whether a four-day week would \u2013 at least for now \u2013 have the backing of the school community. A spokesperson for the Queensland Teachers Union said staff valued the flexible arrangements in place at some schools to put towards professional development and working on school improvement plans. \u201cIt is focused and deliberate and that it is extremely useful in helping both staff and students,\u201d they said. Explaining the policy changes around school hours on ABC radio last month, Queensland\u2019s education minister, Grace Grace, stressed repeatedly that reform was not \u201ca green light\u201d for a four-day week. Instead, she said, it was about establishing \u201cchecks and balances\u201d for those schools that wanted to \u201cexplore\u201d alternative ways of structuring their weeks. The policy, for example, charges principals with ensuring \u201cappropriate supervision is provided for students\u201d when schools start later than 9am or finish earlier than 3pm. And it only allows for changes \u201cwhere the school community determines it provides benefits for students and families\u201d. For Sahlberg that is \u201cthe critical part of this story\u201d. If the parents and students do not support flexible hours \u201cit can be really harmful\u201d, the University of Melbourne professor says. \u201cFamilies and students, they need to sign up for this.\u201d", "Queensland state budget increases taxes on miners, big business to fund new hospitals and mental health services [2022-06-21T05:14:33Z]": "Queensland has announced plans to increase royalties on coal companies amid record profits, as surging prices for fossil fuels help fund investment in the state\u2019s healthcare sector.  The Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the state would record an unexpected $1.9bn surplus in 2021-22 off the back of surging prices for fossil fuels, although a small deficit is forecast next financial year. The centrepiece of the budget is a $23.6bn investment in healthcare \u2013 an increase of $1.2bn, roughly 6% \u2013 that would include measures to hire 9,450 healthcare workers, build three new hospitals and add 2,200 new hospital beds.   Related: Queensland pledges 1,200 new social homes on eve of state budget    The state has also set aside $1.6bn for mental health services over five years, to be funded by a payroll tax levy applied to the largest 1% of businesses. \u201c[The budget] contains responsible revenue measures that focus on companies that can afford today to pay, at a time when they can afford to pay,\u201d Dick said. The government\u2019s pre-existing 10-year freeze on coalmining royalty rates ended this year. Despite prices reaching record rates in recent months, coal companies and the resources lobby had been agitating against any changes. Under the existing scheme, the top tier royalties rate (15%) kicked in at $150 per tonne. Queensland coking coal has been selling for about $500 a tonne. Dick said the old royalty rates structure for coal was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Miners will now pay 20% for prices above $175 a tonne, 30% for prices above $225 a tonne, and 40% for prices above $300 a tonne. The measures are expected to net an additional $1.2bn in revenue before prices temper. The high prices have already had a substantial impact on the state\u2019s bottom line \u2013 coal royalties income for the current financial year will be more than $9bn \u2013 almost triple the projection in last year\u2019s state budget. Compared to last year\u2019s projections, royalties income from coal and gas producers are up about $12bn.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning       Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Dick said multinational coal companies had enjoyed \u201can extraordinary period of stability\u201d but that rates needed to take into account unprecedented windfall prices. He said coal producers could \u201crest easy\u201d knowing that royalties would remain the same when prices temper, and that changes would only net the government a modest amount during a boom time. The Queensland Resources Council has said previously that increasing royalties \u201covernight and without warning will have a negative impact on foreign investment and confidence in our industry\u201d. Investments in healthcare Part of the government\u2019s $23.6b spend on healthcare will go towards a pledge to hire additional 9,450 health workers over the four-year term of the government. New hospitals will be built in Bundaberg, Toowoomba and Coomera. There will also be expansions at hospitals in Cairns, Townsville, Robina, Mackay, Redcliffe, Ipswich and Hervey Bay, as well as facilities in the greater Brisbane area: Princess Alexandra hospital, the QEII hospital, the Prince Charles hospital and Logan hospital. The government has also trumpeted \u201can Australian-first\u201d comprehensive Queensland Cancer Centre will be built at the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s hospital. Dick said the post-pandemic budget would build on the state\u2019s economic standing. \u201cIt is a budget that puts healthcare first,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking advantage of global shifts, like decarbonisation and digitalisation, to realise opportunities in our traditional and emerging industries and help to create more jobs.\u201d Among the cost of living measures announced in the budget was $6.8bn in concessions to Queenslanders \u2013 a 10% increase from last year, including a $175 cost-of-living rebate to manage electricity costs.   Related: \u2018Very different place\u2019: new campaign over mining taxes \u2018unlikely\u2019 to succeed in Queensland    The treasurer said his budget was committed to \u201cprotecting Queenslanders\u2019 lifestyle\u201d and environment in the wake of the biggest boom in internal migration to the sunshine state since 1994. The budget invests in accelerating the construction of new housing estates in the state\u2019s south-east. A $200m commitment over three years will fund infrastructure and interest-free loans to help developers \u201cunlock\u201d new housing in planned high growth areas such as Caboolture West and the Ripley Valley, near Ipswich. It also commits almost $40m to \u201chelp protect Queensland\u2019s native animals at risk\u201d across the region, including $24.6m to support the South East Queensland Koala Conservation strategy. The government said the budget provides for 675 more teachers and nearly 200 additional teacher aides in 2022\u201323, with about 100 of them being those who changed careers after graduating from the Turn to Teaching Internship program. The treasurer said the government would continue to negotiate with unions regarding wage increases for public sector workers like nurses, teachers, transport workers and police. Unions have been pushing for a wage increase for public sector workers that would meet the rising cost of living. The Queensland Council of Unions made a last-minute call to cancel a protest outside parliament house \u201cto consider a formal wages offer from the state government made overnight to unions\u201d. They said unions would consider the offer and discuss it with their members and their decision-making bodies.", "Plane makes \u2018wheels-up\u2019 emergency landing at Newcastle airport after circling for hours [2024-05-13T09:08:46Z]": "A small plane has performed a successful emergency landing without its landing gear lowered at Newcastle airport in New South Wales. \nThe authorities who guided the aircraft down burst into applause as it safely landed on its belly on Monday afternoon. \nThe plane had been circling above Newcastle for almost four hours with three people onboard, including the pilot, after discovering the mechanical issue almost immediately after departing for a flight to Port Macquarie. \nAuthorities had been bracing for a fiery emergency, with more than a dozen crews including fire trucks, police, the State Emergency Service and ambulances at Newcastle airport.

An investigation by Guardian Australia detailed the still widespread practice of Catholic hospitals across Australia using the cover of religion to opt out of providing reproductive care, with devastating consequences.   Related: \u2018I was shocked\u2019: Catholic-run public hospitals refuse to provide birth control and abortion    When it delivered its final report in May, the Senate inquiry into reproductive healthcare access recommended increased accessibility of abortion services at public hospitals. But the inquiry fell short of making it a requirement in order to receive public funding. In 2019, the then shadow minister for women, Tanya Plibersek, indicated Labor would tie funding to public hospitals with willingness to provide abortion services, a policy since dumped by federal Labor. When Guardian Australia asked the prime minister\u2019s office whether Labor would revert to its 2019 policy, it was referred to the assistant minister for health and aged care, Ged Kearney, who did not respond to questions about whether she supported calls to make federal funding conditional on providing full reproductive care. \u201cAll Australians deserve equitable access to the healthcare that they need,\u201d she said. Without reform to funding policies, Dr Ronli Sifris, the deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University, said the disturbing inequities detailed by Guardian Australia would continue. \u201cThe fact that public hospitals in Australia are legally able to conscientiously object means the vast majority of abortions are provided through the private sector,\u201d Sifris said. \u201cThis is unacceptable. And it would not be accepted if it were any other area of health care.\u201d Liz Wilkes is based in Toowoomba, Queensland, where she is managing director of My Midwives, the largest private midwifery practice in Australia.

After getting the results of a scan, if there is a problem, these women can\u2019t stay there and be treated and cared for. They then are transferred to another hospital to undergo further treatment and have the termination. \u201cI think in situations where women are already traumatised and stressed that making them travel like that is absolutely not OK, to find it\u2019s not possible due to these crazy religiously driven restrictions on services.

Queensland police have repeatedly cautioned against vigilantism, with commissioner Katarina Carroll last week warning it could result in a death. Alwyn Doolan, a Gooreng Gooreng and Wakka Wakka man from the Aboriginal community of Woorabinda, west of Rockhampton, said he had heard of several other incidents involving the Indigenous community over the past few weeks. \u201cThere was a woman racially abused in Gracemere, that was going to pick up her daughter from school and had been called out racial names,\u201d Doolan said. \u201cThe tensions are high in the community around what the vigilantes are doing but also the fear-mongering [towards] predominantly Indigenous peoples.\u201d First Nations people were often \u201cpainted with the same brush\u201d and are weary after being \u201cstereotyped\u201d, he said.

The transport minister, Catherine King, said the allocation of $78.8m was part of Labor\u2019s $500m election commitment to the early stages of high speed rail, with the initial Sydney-Newcastle leg representing a \u201ccrucial waypoint\u201d on the project. The newly formed High Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) will deliver the business case to the government by the end of the year, and will determine a proposed alignment, station locations and the type of train sets to be used.   Related: Albanese\u2019s high speed rail agency on a slow track, saying it\u2019s busy with \u2018strategic plan\u2019    Crucially, the HSRA will also develop a cost estimate and construction timeframe for the Sydney-Newcastle line. \u201cHigh-speed rail is a transformative project that will change travel between cities and provide a catalyst for economic development in regional areas,\u201d King said. \u201cThis is more than just a transport project. It will create jobs, improve productivity and support Australia\u2019s progress on environmental outcomes,\u201d she said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Albanese government has been heavily criticised for the slow pace of its high speed rail project. It took almost seven months after the HSRA\u2019s formation last June to appoint an inaugural CEO \u2013 former Sydney Metro project delivery head Tim Parker. The Greens\u2019 transport spokesperson Elizabeth Watson-Brown, said that delay was \u201cpretty insulting to Australians\u201d. Watson-Brown was also critical of King for saying she was open to looking at private sector financing, such as pension funds. She accused the government of \u201cgrossly\u201d underfunding the project and working to a delivery timeframe of the 2060s for the entire east coast line, claiming it could be built much faster. In December, the opposition transport spokesperson, Bridget McKenzie, said the government had achieved \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d towards its fast rail ambition. The first section of the high speed track, which aims to deliver a 45-minute trip between Sydney and Newcastle, would be a significant improvement on the existing line \u2013 service times have gotten slower over the past century to a current express trip time of about 2.5 hours. The government has also committed to opening an HSRA office in Newcastle. However, King, speaking to the ABC earlier this month, suggested the government would not make the existing trip between Sydney and Newcastle faster before the first stretch of the high speed line was completed, 10 years from now at the earliest. The HSRA only formally came into existence last June after legislation was passed paving the way for the abolishment of the National Faster Rail Agency (NFRA), a body established by the Morrison government in 2019, which did not deliver on earlier high-speed rail projects.   Related: NSW slams brakes on high-speed rail plans after spending $100m on studies    The board first announced it was working to identify its inaugural CEO on 13 June \u2013 the day the HSRA came into existence. It took a month and a half, until 26 July, for the job advertisement to be listed online. Interviews for the CEO role had been conducted by October, the HSRA\u2019s interim chief, Andrew Hyles, told a budget estimates hearing that month. The glacial pace of the government\u2019s fast rail project was laid bare during that hearing, when Hyles told senators detailed planning would not begin until 2024 because the organisation was busy completing its \u201corganisational strategy\u201d. In response to questions about the project\u2019s progress, Hyles referred senators to a \u201ccorporate plan\u201d on its website, drawing comparisons to Utopia, an Australian TV series satirising the absurdity of government bureaucracy.  Sydney-Newcastle has long been identified in high speed rail proposals as an ideal initial corridor, but experts have flagged the costly and logistically complicated tunnelling requirements. In 2019, the New South Wales government committed to build its own fast rail line between the two cities, but quietly dropped the idea after spending four years and roughly $100m on feasibility studies. Australia\u2019s significant nationwide infrastructure pipeline has seen the costs of construction inflate and has led recently to some rail projects, including the Melbourne-Geelong fast rail, being axed.", " \u2018It\u2019s unacceptable\u2019: as pro-Palestine encampments grow at Australian campuses so do claims of antisemitism [2024-05-09T15:00:17Z]": "Nazi salutes were allegedly performed during an Australian National University student association meeting this week, the latest in a string of accusations of antisemitism as pro-Palestine encampments enter their third week in Australia. \nThe Australasian Union of Jewish Students (AUJS) says the alleged gestures occurred at the ANU Students\u2019 Association\u2019s (ANUSA) annual general meeting on Wednesday evening when a motion was raised by Jewish students to address antisemitism. \nThe university has launched an internal investigation.

The bill relief, which begins in July, is a joint plan between the federal, state and territory governments. Amounts vary between jurisdictions, based on their exposure to the national energy market and pre-existing energy rebate or tariff schemes. Small businesses will also get $325 in energy bill relief from the federal government. All states and territories, except for Victoria and the ACT, will make the same contribution. The changes mean there will be different degrees of savings for each state and territory. New South Wales residents would be heading for a 40% increase in energy bills, the treasury forecasts, but the assistance turns that into a 7% reduction for eligible households. Queenslanders are on track for a 43% increase, but eligible households could see a 10% decrease in their bills.   Related: Federal budget 2023: winners and losers summary    The rebates will be automatically deducted from energy bills over the next financial year, meaning eligible residents do not need to apply for the savings. Pensioners, veterans, seniors and other concession card holders and recipients of a carer\u2019s allowance or a family tax benefit, as well as anyone who currently qualifies for state or territory electricity concessions, are eligible for a household rebate.

But is a federal funding commitment enough to get it done? [2023-11-17T23:00:04Z]": "Throughout her decades in politics, Jacinta Allan hasn\u2019t been afraid to pick a fight with the federal government \u2013 no matter which party was in power. But on Thursday, when the Albanese government announced it would cut $4.8bn worth of infrastructure funding in Victoria after a months-long review, the premier was uncharacteristically subdued. Allan made clear it was her expectation the money from the 12 axed projects would remain in the state, which she said had failed to receive its \u201cfair share\u201d of infrastructure funding for \u201cfar too long\u201d. Her comments were in stark contrast to those made by Labor governments in Queensland and New South Wales \u2013 the former rejected the infrastructure review outright while the latter expressed \u201cdisappointment with a capital D\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  It was no coincidence she spoke about the cuts at the site of the soon-to-be-completed Anzac Station, which forms part of the $12bn Metro Tunnel \u2013 a project that did not receive a single dollar from the federal government.    In question time later that day, Allan played down the cuts and rebuffed a laughable attempt by the opposition leader, John Pesutto, to characterise the government\u2019s infrastructure agenda as in \u201cdisarray\u201d. \u201cWe know that the failed former federal Liberal-National government put a whole bunch of projects on the federal infrastructure agenda not because they could be delivered, but because they were after them to deliver votes for them in the lead-up to the election,\u201d Allan said. The same, however, could be said about another project that survived the cull: the long-awaited Melbourne airport train line. At the 2018 state election, the then-premier Daniel Andrews vowed to be the government \u201cthat finally gets it done\u201d \u2013 six decades after a rail link from Melbourne to Tullamarine was first proposed.    While the failure of successive governments to deliver the project has become a running joke in Victoria, there was reason to believe it would become a reality. The federal and state government\u2019s both committed $5bn to the project, a business case was released and early works began in October 2022 \u2013 right before a state election.  Behind the scenes, however, the project was a mess. Negotiations between the owners of Melbourne airport and the state government had stalled, with the former firmly opposed to plans for an above-ground station. According to government sources, the airport had a list of 10,000 technical requirements for the project, which included wall surfaces that \u201cengage the five human senses to reduce anxiety\u201d, roof lining in a \u201cwarm\u201d material to \u201cemphasise the horizontality of the roof planes\u201d and \u201cthermal comfort metrics in outdoor zones\u201d \u2013 ie fountains and water play areas for children. They said airport also demanded $1bn in compensation during the construction of the station \u2013 more than four times the costs outlined in its business case \u2013 which Melbourne airport has disputed.   Related: Melbourne airport rail, fast trains and road funding cuts: what the infrastructure review means for your state    While some Labor MPs say they were blindsided when the project was halted in May \u2013 as the Victorian government waited for the findings of the review \u2013 many were relieved. With the commonwealth recommitting to the project, the Allan government is hopeful it will play a more active role in the negations, or use its planning powers to break the impasse. \u201cThe project is 100% stuck,\u201d a Victorian government source said. \u201c[The federal infrastructure minister] Catherine King needs to unstick it because we have been trying for three years and haven\u2019t been able to.\u201d For her part, King has committed to installing an independent negotiator to resolve the stalemate. In a statement, the airport claimed the reason the state wanted an elevated station was because it could be built faster. The government, however, suggests an underground station could cost up to $60bn \u2013 and even more if soil contamination from firefighting foams containing PFAS is found. Meanwhile the federal infrastructure review spared the Victorian government\u2019s flagship project \u2013 the Suburban Rail Loop \u2013 as the $2bn in commonwealth funding was an election commitment. But it did raise concerns about its business case. In any event, the cost to build both projects at the same time will be a huge undertaking for the state government, even with federal help. The delays will also come at a cost: Allan on Thursday conceded the price of the airport rail will end up more than the planned $8-13bn, and its 2029 opening date will be pushed back. It leaves Victorians wondering whether the joke is on them.", "Budget broccoli and low-price pears: Australia\u2019s best-value fruit and veg for July [2023-07-05T15:00:38Z]": "Citrus and apples may dominate our fruit bowls in winter, but in July, don\u2019t forget to take advantage of pear prices. \u201cPer kilo, pears are often cheaper than apples this July,\u201d says Ash Fooladi, owner of Mayfair Fresh in Petersham, Sydney. \u201cBrown pears and packham pears are about $3 a kilo, whereas apples are about $5 to $6 a kilo.\u201d In supermarkets, packham pears can be found on special for about $2.80 a kilo and brown pears (also known as beurre bosc) are about $3.50 a kilo. The latter variety is best suited for Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect poached pears, while warm honeyed pears will level up your morning porridge \u2013 that is, if you\u2019re willing to deviate from the traditional recipe.    At about $6 a kilo in supermarkets, kanzis are the most expensive apples on the market, while pink ladies remain the cheapest at about $3.50. According to Fooladi, July is going to be the best time for persimmons, thanks to more plentiful supply. Currently, they can be found on special in supermarkets for about $2.90 each, so give persimmons a chance. The firmer fuyu variety pairs particularly well with prosciutto or serrano ham. Is this the month you make \u2018meat fruit\u2019? Navel oranges remain affordable at about $2.50 a kilo on special in supermarkets \u2013 and you should continue to make the most of mandarins as prices remain steady at $3.50 a kilo. If you\u2019re keen to do more than eat the segments straight away, turn them into Anna Jones\u2019s quick mandarin compote (just make sure to remove any pips). For those with lots of mandarins, time and ambition, try Heston Blumenthal\u2019s \u201cmeat fruit\u201d.    Quinces too are in season and plentiful, says Carmel Dawson, owner of Geelong Fresh Foods in Victoria. \u201cThey are big [in season] at the moment \u2026 They\u2019re about $5 a kilo and very good quality,\u201d she says. In supermarkets, you can find quinces for $6 to $7 a kilo. Roast them, poach them, turn them into jelly for future cheese sandwiches, or make membrillo (Sicilian quince paste), which will keep for months. For those on avocado price watch, the alligator pears are cheap and are getting cheaper. You can find them for about $1.50 each in grocers and supermarkets. At Willoughby Fresh in Sydney, owner Charles Scala says the choice of winter fruit is \u201ca bit boring\u201d, but shoppers can add variety \u2013 for a price. Strawberries remain expensive \u2013 Scala sells two punnets for $10 \u2013 as cold weather in May has affected the Queensland crop. Australian grapes, currently about $4 a kilo, are on their way out and will almost double in price when US imports arrive.  \u2018Eat more soup\u2019 Pumpkin once again leads the pack in affordable winter vegetables. They are about $2.50 a kilo in supermarkets, followed closely by potatoes at $3.50 to $4.50 a kilo.  Celery is good value in supermarkets at about $2.99 a bunch and carrots are a few dollars for a bag. Fooladi says this is the month to \u201ceat more soup\u201d, so caldo verde, ribollita and adas bil hamoud it is. And if you have beetroot \u2013 about $6 a kilo in supermarkets \u2013 of course, you make borscht.     If you\u2019ll prefer to exit the soup chat, try Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s vibrant butternut squash polenta, or his jacket potatoes, with a twist (spoiler alert: there\u2019s tonnato). Rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 veg and budget broccoli To maximise winter\u2019s root vegetable season, grab one kilogram of your favourite underground friends \u2013 swedes, parsnips, carrots, radish \u2013 and layer them in Alice Zaslavsky\u2019s cheesy root vegetable bake. Dawson says aside from root vegetables, cauliflower and broccoli are headliners in July.    \u201cA whole cauliflower is $3.99 and broccoli is $4.99\u201d a kilo, she says of her stock in Geelong. In supermarkets, you can find a cauliflower for $3.50 or less \u2013 find a big one and turn it into this Suya-spiced, peanutty roast cauliflower. To make use of budget-friendly broccoli (about $3 a kilo in supermarkets), make sticky broccoli fried rice or Alice Zaslavsky\u2019s green-as-you-can-get box grater broccoli pasta. To add some freshness to your winter meals, leafy greens remain cheap and in good supply, and Fooladi says red and green capsicums are cheaper than usual at about $4.90 a kilo. But avoid cabbage, says Dawson. \u201cCabbage is a bit expensive because it is a summer line,\u201d she says. \u201cWe sell it for $4 for a half or $8 for a whole. We only have it available year round because growers still grow it.\u201d And the worst vegetable pick for July is asparagus. You\u2019ll find them in supermarkets for about $3.50 a bunch, but they are mostly imported, according to Dawson, and of a lesser quality than usual. But brussels sprouts are looking good and remain stable at about $9 to $10 a kilo.

This is a core strategic investment for Australia.\u201d The sector is asking the government to commit to a clear timetable for meeting a pledge to restore official development assistance to 0.5% of gross national income. To deal with more immediate crises, such as natural disasters and famine in the region and beyond, the sector also wants the government to double the $150m annual humanitarian emergency fund. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that the need is escalating through the impacts of Covid, the impact of conflict, particularly the war in Ukraine, and obviously, the climate crisis, which has no borders,\u201d Goringe said. Faysel Ahmed Selat, the president of the Somali Community Association of Queensland, travelled to Canberra to support the Help Fight Famine campaign, which seeks a $110m famine prevention package focused on the Horn of Africa, Yemen, Afghanistan and Syria. \u201cWhat I can tell you is the Somali community in Australia \u2026 are going without and sending money to family members who would otherwise have nothing,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe are suffering because of the loss of family members, grandparents, children, mothers, fathers, or we may be worried about their wellbeing.\u201d Pat Conroy, the minister for international development, defence industry and the Pacific, has sought to assure the sector that the government is not focused only on hard power. Conroy said the government was \u201cserious about putting development at the centre of how we do international engagement\u201d. \u201cWhen I talk to the leaders of the Department of Defence, they\u2019re evangelical that hard power \u2013 acquiring nuclear submarines \u2013 has to be complemented with equal efforts on soft power, investing in diplomacy, investing in development,\u201d he said. Conroy said members of the cabinet\u2019s national security committee accepted that Australia faced \u201cthe greatest strategic uncertainty since 1945\u201d and this compelled the government to invest in all elements of statecraft. He said that attitude was a big reason he and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, had secured \u201cso much support\u201d internally to increase development funding by $1.4bn over four years in the Albanese government\u2019s first budget. Conroy said the government would \u201calways look at opportunities to make sure that money is spent well and, where there are opportunities, to increase it\u201d, but he added a word of caution about the budget. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very tight fiscal environment at the moment, and we need to balance all those demands.\u201d The increase to development funding announced last October came on top of a low base because of multibillion-dollar cuts made during the Coalition\u2019s time in office. In 2021 Australia was ranked 21st out of 29 OECD donors for development assistance, delivering 0.22% of gross national income.", "Are Australia\u2019s public transport discounts for seniors too generous? Are they fair? [2024-06-29T20:00:04Z]": "It\u2019s the uncomfortable question few politicians would dare to ask. Are generous travel discounts afforded to Australia\u2019s older citizens, especially self-funded retirees who are not means tested, sustainable? Moreover, are they fair? Seniors have long enjoyed heavily subsidised public transport fares across Australia. But as the population ages, public finance strains and a cost-of-living crisis weighs disproportionately on younger generations, some are suggesting a rethink. Australian agencies, including the Productivity Commission and state pricing tribunals, have consistently raised the issue of having high-income customers access generous transport discounts, while those who need help miss out. Avoiding \u2018battle of the generations\u2019 The chief executive of Sydney-based Youth Action, Kate Munro, says commuters aged under 25 would greatly benefit from a reduction in travel costs, given they are also among the most exposed to relentless increases in living costs. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting seniors should hand their concession cards over, but we should be able to do something for younger people as well so that it doesn\u2019t feel like a battle of the generations,\u201d says Munro. While children and tertiary students receive travel concessions, in some states the daily cap on their fares is well over three times that offered to seniors.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Arrangements for seniors differ in each state and territory, with some jurisdictions using a model of free travel during off-peak hours and concession fares at other times, as is the case in Western Australia. South Australia has some of the most generous arrangements, with free travel for seniors on Adelaide metro buses, trains and trams. In New South Wales, seniors have enjoyed the same, low daily $2.50 cap for about two decades. Queensland will start its 50 cent public transport fare trial in early August, which is for everyone, including seniors. In Victoria, seniors receive a 50% fare discount on most trains, trams and buses and other benefits including travel vouchers and free weekend travel for short distances. Most seniors\u2019 discounts kick in at age 60, depending on their working arrangements. But as the cost of living rises, an increasing number of full-time university students are losing their concession passes as they shift to a part-time load to work more.   Related: Australia\u2019s first high-speed rail link could ease house prices and widen the dating pool, UK expert says    \u201cWhat would that look like for young people on low incomes to access affordable transport, because the cost of young people not being able to live to their full potential is pretty high,\u201d Munro says. Bridie O\u2019Kelly, a 20-year-old university student in Sydney who works part-time for her local federal member, says high travel costs are deterring young people from commuting to extracurricular activities, robbing cash-strapped students of important opportunities open to others. \u201cStudents use public transport arguably far more than retired individuals, so I think there just needs to be a bit more of a conversation around this,\u201d says O\u2019Kelly, who recently lost her travel concessions after moving from full to part-time study. Seniors card \u2018more generous\u2019 Fares paid by passengers cover between 20% and 50% of the actual cost of running the service, depending on mode type and city, according to Prof John Nelson from University of Sydney\u2019s institute of transport and logistics studies. He says concession fares tend to be 50% of full fares, but places such as NSW have greater subsidies for seniors. Taxpayers foot the rest of the bill. The Productivity Commission says public transport users are generally unaware that their trip can sometimes cost 10 or more times the fare they pay, with subsidised fares equating to \u201cbillions of dollars of annual public transport subsidies\u201d. In 2022-23, NSW taxpayers spent $235m on public transport concessions across seniors, students and all other discount categories. This figure is expected to grow to $269m in 2023-24, and $289 in 2024-25, according to state budget figures. In NSW, the daily cap for the seniors\u2019 Gold Opal has stayed at $2.50 for about two decades. By comparison, child/youth and concession holders receive an $8.90 cap on most weekdays, while the price ramps up to $17.80 for the adult fare cap.   Related: \u2018We were flying\u2019: Sydney metro line under harbour due to open in August with speeds of 100km/h    \u201cYou can make the case that the senior\u2019s transport card should be based on more than just being over 60,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cThere is an important discussion to be had, as the seniors card is actually quite a bit more generous than fares for students or people on Centrelink.\u201d Nelson acknowledges it wouldn\u2019t be popular, but means testing concessions for older people makes sense to him. \u201cWe already discriminate over concession eligibility in the context of students, why aren\u2019t we doing that with other segments?\u201d    The state\u2019s Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended in 2016 that the Gold Opal cap be increased to $3.60, noting that relatively small increases of heavily discounted tickets could be used to fund additional discounts for others, such as low income earners with healthcare cards. It also recommended a review of the eligibility arrangements for the discounted fares, so that benefits were better targeted towards people who need them most. The NSW Labor treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, says he doesn\u2019t support a change to seniors\u2019 concessions, and that increases wouldn\u2019t save \u201cmassive amounts of money\u201d anyway.   Related: Australia\u2019s inflation rises to 4%, stoking concern interest rates could increase again    \u201cI don\u2019t think that we need to pit one group against another when it comes to our choice to subsidise public transport much the same way that I think it\u2019s a good thing that we universally provide subsidies to school kids who use public transport too so they can move around,\u201d Mookhey says. The NSW government announced on Wednesday that fares would rise by an average of 3.6% as part of an annual review, although various daily and weekly caps, including the senior rate, will stay the same. Clive Palmer should pay: expert Overseas, economies with generous transport discounts for older citizens, including Hong Kong, are grappling with questions of fairness in a high cost-of-living world too. There\u2019s also a question about whether public finances can sustain concessions over the long term, as the economy slows and populations age. But there are strong arguments for the senior concessions too. Seniors groups have consistently argued there are societal benefits to retaining heavily discounted fares because it encourages the cohort to participate in unpaid volunteering and caring activities, as well as ensuring older people remain socially connected. Further, the Australian Independent Retirees Association said in a government submission earlier this year seniors\u2019 use of public transport reduces pressure on road networks. The deputy director of Griffith University\u2019s Cities Research Institute, Prof Matthew Burke, adds generous public transport discounts for seniors are important given the high rates of forfeiture and restrictions on driving licences. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much recompense, but it\u2019s part of the set of policies in place to look after seniors in their later life,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile most seniors have less disposable income, there are many cashed up [baby] boomers whose superannuation funds have done well and they could afford to make a larger contribution to public transport costs, but it\u2019s a small cohort. \u201cOnly a handful are really living it up. Should Clive Palmer pay full fare for the bus? Probably. But most of the people on seniors cards have paid their way over a very long time.\u201d", "Morning Mail: aged care \u2018gaming\u2019 funding, coalmine approved, fears of \u2018another Juukan Gorge\u2019 [2023-05-11T20:49:00Z]": "Morning, everyone.

Jonathan Sriranganathan, then a Greens councillor, was arrested last October as he stood on a public footpath outside the Land Forces Weapons Expo at the Convention Centre in South Brisbane. Sriranganathan said he was taking part in a peaceful protest and had not blocked roads or access to the building. But Queensland police service officers charged him with trespass and obstructing police. Police dropped the charges this month. Sriranganathan, who announced his resignation as a councillor in March, said it was the second time he had been arrested, only for police to abandon the case. \u201cPolice have demonstrated a consistent pattern of unlawfully arresting me and targeting me, which reflects a broader trend of police abusing their powers to suppress peaceful protest and criminalise activists,\u201d Sriranganathan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been repeatedly dragged through the watch house and treated like shit, but I\u2019m willing to forgive all of that if the police minister will simply give me a public apology.\u201d A QPS spokesperson said: \u201cCharges against a 35-year-old Woolloongabba man, including one count each of trespass and obstruct police, have been withdrawn as a result of a key witness being unable to give evidence on medical grounds. \u201cThis matter remains under investigation by the Ethical Standards Command and as such no further comment will be provided at this time.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  This comes after Queensland police dropped a charge against Sriranganathan in 2020 after he was arrested for allegedly failing to heed a police direction during a refugee rights protest. Separately, recordings leaked to Guardian Australia from the Brisbane city watch house captured an officer discussing the protest and describing Sriranganathan as \u201ca piece of crap and a halfwit\u201d. \u201cI think the police\u2019s heavy-handed treatment of me compared to other white politicians who attend protests is partly a result of racism,\u201d Sriranganathan said. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that I would have lasted longer in my role as councillor if not for the consistent police harassment and abuses of power.\u201d Police also withdrew a fine issued to Sriranganathan in 2021 after alleging he had run a yellow light on a bicycle while riding home from an Invasion Day rally. The officer who fined him had been criticising the then councillor on social media for about 18 months but said in his report that he had not identified Sriranganathan until after he pulled him over. The councillor has long rallied against local government laws that he claims are suppressing people\u2019s right to protest. Sriranganathan was found guilty last August over a 15-minute, four-person protest over the cashless welfare debit card at Queen Street mall in Brisbane\u2019s city centre.    Related: Queensland police warned internally multiple times that discipline system was being run in \u2018concerning\u2019 way    The Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, said the QPS had a problem with \u201csystemic misconduct\u201d.\u201cFor police to so blatantly target an elected representative, including arresting him on multiple occasions without any evidence or basis, should be of grave concern to every single person who cares about democracy in this state,\u201d he said.Berkman is calling for the government to establish an independent, civilian-led police integrity unit, which was a recommendation of the commission of inquiry into police responses to domestic violence. \u201cGetting rid of the conflict of interest when police investigate themselves is the very least we could do to stop the rot,\u201d he said. Queensland\u2019s police minister, Mark Ryan, said he strongly urged anyone with \u201ccomplaints about their treatment by members of the Queensland police service to take their concerns to the relevant authority\u201d. In this case that would be the police\u2019s internal unit, the ethical standards command. \u201cLike all Queenslanders, I expect the highest standards of professional and ethical behaviour from all members of the Queensland police service,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe government and the Queensland police service strongly support the right of people to protest. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note though, that while these protest actions are supported, there is also a responsibility for those who take part in such protests to do so lawfully, respectfully and peacefully.\u201d  This story was changed on 26 April 2023 to include new information provided by Queensland police.

Faruqi launched legal action against Hanson in the federal court in May, after the One Nation leader told the Greens senator to \u201cpack [her] bags and piss off back to Pakistan\u201d in a tweet, in response to Faruqi\u2019s thoughts on the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Hanson has said she will fight the racial vilification claim, arguing freedom of political speech. In her court statement, Faruqi claimed she had been \u201cbeen subject to a torrent of abusive phone calls, social media posts and hate mail (including death threats, misogynistic and racially and sexually violent content).\u201d In her message to supporters, Faruqi said taking the matter to court was about \u201cholding [Hanson] accountable for her actions\u201d. \u201cMy resolve to hold Senator Pauline Hanson to account only got stronger when so many people who have felt the sear of racism got in touch to lend their support after her tweet,\u201d Faruqi told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had more than enough of being racially vilified and then gaslighted when we speak up against it. \u201cFor everyone who\u2019s been told to go back to where they came from, who has been subjected to discrimination due to their skin colour, who\u2019s had to endure racist remarks, or been looked over for a job or promotion \u2013 this fight is for all of us.\u201d   Related: Mehreen Faruqi to sue Pauline Hanson over offensive tweet    Hanson has previously announced her own fundraising initiatives to help fund her defence against Faruqi\u2019s case, which includes selling knitted jumpers. Faruqi said money raised by her GoFundMe would be used for legal costs and paying any costs to Hanson if her case is unsuccessful.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  If successful, Faruqi has committed to donating surplus money after legal fees to the Sweatshop Literacy Movement in western Sydney. All names and donations to the crowdfunder will be declared in Faruqi\u2019s parliamentary statement of interests once the court case has concluded. Faruqi lodged her complaint with the federal court and said if successful, she wants Hanson to make a $150,000 donation to the Sweatshop Literacy Movement, undertake anti-racism training at her own cost and to publish a new tweet saying she had used offensive language. She is also asking the court to restrain Hanson from making similar comments in the future. Hanson has previously vowed to fight the complaint \u201ceven if that requires taking the matter to the high court\u201d. Hanson has hired Bret Walker and Sue Chrysanthou to defend her against Faruqi\u2019s complaint, in what is shaping up as a potential defining case for section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. In her a statement to the court in defence of Faruqi\u2019s complaint, Hanson\u2019s legal team contends that sections 18C and 18D of the racial discrimination act breach the implied constitutional right to freedom of political speech. The federal court can not decide constitutional matters, only whether there has been a breach of the legislation or not. Hanson avoided a rare censure motion by the Senate last month, after she withdrew \u201cunparliamentary\u201d comments she made to Faruqi during a parliamentary debate, including that she would take Faruqi \u201cto the airport and put you on a plane and wave you away\u201d. Hanson was temporarily gagged from speaking in the Senate after she originally refused multiple requests from the Senate president to withdraw the comments, saying she would need time to think about it, and offering Faruqi a \u201ctissue\u201d. Faruqi said she was taking the federal court action \u201con behalf of any person who has suffered at the hands of racism in Australia\u201d. \u201cNow more than ever is the time to strengthen our push against racism and defend legal protections for people who are subjected to racial discrimination in our country.\u201d", "Whistleblower claims Australian funds for asylum seeker welfare in PNG \u2018gone missing\u2019 [2023-10-23T14:00:02Z]": "The Australian-sponsored program to care for refugees exiled to Papua New Guinea has been riven by corruption, fraud and nepotism, a whistleblower within the PNG government\u2019s immigration authority has alleged in a complaint sent to the country\u2019s prime minister, James Marape. The whistleblower also claimed that police investigations into corruption within the PNG immigration and citizenship authority (ICA) were abandoned under political pressure not to investigate. The whistleblower, a current employee of the ICA, alleged there was documentary evidence supporting claims \u201cthe Australian taxpayer funding allocation for the management of refugees under the PNG Humanitarian Program has been depleted or gone missing\u201d. But PNG\u2019s chief migration officer, Stanislau Hulahau, has rejected the allegations as malicious.   Related: Australia will pay $27m compensation to Indonesians held in adult jails when they were children    \u201cWhat is being said is not true.

They were used legitimately. There is no element of corruption.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cI will make sure that we properly investigate those allegations and a proper report is provided to the prime minister and to our minister. And the officers who have raised those allegations will be asked to provide any facts, any evidence, so we are able to conclude this matter,\u201d Hulahau said. The allegations relate to the PNG Humanitarian Program (PHP), established to provide support and welfare for the final refugees and asylum seekers left in PNG after the closure of Australia\u2019s illegal offshore detention centre on Manus Island. Shrouded in secrecy Australia funded PNG\u2019s Humanitarian Program through a secret contract signed in 2021 by the Morrison government \u2013 the details of which the Albanese government still refuses to reveal. The money was provided out of Australia\u2019s $303m irregular maritime arrival \u201coffshore management\u201d budget and sent to PNG\u2019s immigration and citizenship authority, from where it has been paid to PNG private contractors to provide accommodation, groceries, medical care and transport to refugees and asylum seekers. But the money provided by Australia has essentially run out and the services required to support the 64 refugees and asylum seekers sent to PNG by Australia a decade ago have all been cut or drastically reduced.   Related: Asylum seekers sent to Nauru by Australian government only months after last detainees were removed    A number of refugees have been threatened with eviction from their accommodation. Several PNG businesses, including motels where refugees are housed, transport companies, and security firms, are owed millions of dollars. Port Moresby\u2019s main hospital is owed nearly $40m. In a letter dated 9 October, the whistleblower alleged widespread corruption \u2013 particularly around the hiring of cars. He claimed private vehicles were \u201ccross-hired\u201d so as to disguise the beneficiaries of contracts, and relatives of senior officials were allowing their private vehicles to be hired through a front company, in order to claim a personal benefit. The whistleblower also claimed contracts were improperly awarded, without an open tender process, and given to companies with no experience providing the services required. And he alleged PNG police\u2019s fraud and anti-corruption directorate initiated investigations into six complaints made against the PNG immigration authority, but that these were discontinued under political pressure.   Related: Refugees in PNG told they will be evicted after Australian-sponsored housing bills not paid     \u201cFor a while now, there have been rumours and claims amongst concerned Immigration and Citizenship Authority staff that the PNG Humanitarian Project funds have been depleted, which is the cause as to the months of non-payments to PHP service providers,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cIf the PHP funds have been depleted without justification and cause, then the most likely conclusion would be that PHP funds were embezzled (mismanaged and or misappropriated).\u201d Guardian Australia does not assert the truth of the allegations made, only that they have been made and are being investigated. The complaint requests that a committee of inquiry be appointed. Complaints allege fraud The 12-page complaint was addressed to deputy prime minister, John Rosso, who is also the minister for immigration.

Speaking after a three-car crash in Maryborough on Sunday that led to the deaths of three women, Queensland\u2019s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, said the tragedy showed a different approach was needed to keep the community safe.

We need health services to step up. We need disability support to be available, accessible and of high quality,\u201d she said. A report by Save the Children labelled Queensland as one of the worst offenders in Australia when it comes to violating children\u2019s rights in the youth justice system. Lewis said Queensland must follow the example of Scotland, which had committed to enshrining the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into law, making it illegal for public authorities to act incompatibly with its requirements. Scotland had established a three-year action plan for children, with their rights dispersed across different government portfolios. It had also introduced an obligation for ministers to report progress and outcomes about what has been done to reduce inequity. The commissioners\u2019 suggestions come at a time of heightened anger in the community and calls for more punitive approaches. The Queensland police union\u2019s president, Ian Leavers, this week said \u201ca minimum of life imprisonment\u201d was the community\u2019s expectation for any person who commits an \u201cadult crime\u201d. But McDougall said that \u201cwe can\u2019t continue to erode children\u2019s rights every time there\u2019s a tragedy\u201d. \u201cIn times of crisis, it\u2019s actually more important that we hold strong \u2026 and use human rights as a north star,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to make calls for tougher penalties but there is no evidence that tougher penalties, longer sentences \u2026 and more time for children in detention, actually does anything to improve community safety.\u201d Lewis said government departments needed to be held accountable to collaborate in the best interests of children. \u201cThat\u2019s what will make a difference, not piecemeal, reactive policy responses to a particular incident at a point in time.\u201d A Queensland government spokesperson said: \u201cAny portfolio that has contact with a child deemed to be at risk focuses on early intervention to prevent small problems from becoming bigger ones.\u201d They said $100m had been invested in tackling \u201cthe complex causes of crime \u2026 holding perpetrators to account and better supporting victims\u201d. \u201cState policies and legislation are guided by the United Nations charter of human rights.

The unemployment rate in April was 4.1%, seasonally adjusted, compared with a revised 3.9% for March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Economists had predicted the jobless rate would edge higher for a third consecutive month to 3.9%.   Interactive   The economy added a net 38,500 positions with full-time roles down 6,100 while part-time positions rose 44,600. Economists had forecast employers would add 23,700 jobs in April. The participation rate \u2013 a measure of those looking for work \u2013 ticked higher to 66.7% last month. Economists had expected it would hold steady at 66.6%. Hours worked, meanwhile, were little changed for the month. The labour market can be volatile, such as February\u2019s shock 116,500 jobs increase. The federal government\u2019s budget this week predicted the unemployment rate would be 4.25% by June and 4.5% a year later. The RBA, which sets its cash rate according to its own forecasts for employment and inflation, earlier this month predicted the jobless rate would be 4% by June, then 4.2% by year\u2019s end and 4.3% in June 2025. The government has forecast inflation would be back to the RBA\u2019s target 2-3% band by December, a result that would increase the chances of a cut in interest rates and eliminate the risk of a 14th rate increase in this cycle. The jobless rate was also 4.1% in January. Before then the last time the unemployment figure was this high was in January 2022. Investors said the labour data suggested another rate rise was less likely \u2013 with the dollar easing a tenth of a US cent to about 66.9 US cents.

A landmark review into sex work by the Queensland Law Reform Commission has made 47 recommendations, including scrapping the Prostitution Licensing Authority, repealing some police powers and allowing services to be advertised on radio and TV. The QLRC also recommended that sex workers not be singled out for public soliciting or street-based sex work, and said planning rules should allow services to operate away from industrial zones.

Fentiman said decriminalisation of sex work would \u201censure that some of the most vulnerable people in our community have legal protections at work\u201d. She confirmed this would mean abolishing the Prostitution Licensing Authority, which regulates the state\u2019s 20 brothels. \u201cThe sex-work industry will be regulated by workplace health and safety laws, planning laws, advertising codes and standards, and public amenity and public nuisance laws,\u201d she told reporters on Monday.

Craig Petersen, who represents the principals of public schools across the state, said not only do public schools not have the budget to compete, but they were also restricted from lifting teachers\u2019 salaries above the award wage. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to fill a position at your nongovernment school, you can offer five to 10 to $20,000 bonuses, and you can provide other perks for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for someone to knock back that opportunity.\u201d   Related: The parents fleeing Australia\u2019s public school system \u2013 and those choosing to stay    It comes as Guardian Australia revealed funding to independent and Catholic schools has increased almost twice as much compared with public schools in the decade since the landmark Gonski review, which set out a roadmap to fund schools according to their need. Petersen said teachers were also struggling under the strain of a public school system underfunded to deliver to the needs of its students. \u201cOur classrooms are incredibly complex because of the diversity, because we\u2019re not adequately funded, and because we never got those final years of the additional Gonski funding,\u201d he said. The president of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, agreed the consequences of the funding increase divide between public and private schools was playing out in the hot competition for teachers.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  He pointed to the principal of Sceggs Darlinghurst, an independent school in Sydney, saying at the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s schools summit earlier this year that the school paid \u201ctop of the scale\u201d teachers $135,000. The top bracket in the public education system is currently $117,060. \u201cThe answer to this lies in governments fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure every classroom has a qualified teacher, and that must be through competitive salaries and manageable workloads,\u201d he said. Graham Catt, the chief executive of Independent Schools Australia, said the 1,200 independent schools across Australia had vastly different resourcing and operational capabilities, with some likely being in a better position to attract and retain teachers than others. For other independent schools which are focused on providing the lowest fees possible for parents, he said they would struggle to find the revenue to provide teachers an additional pay rise. \u201cThe workforce issues is across every sector, and I think it\u2019s by working together and through the review of the [National School Reform Agreement] that we have our best chance of solving that,\u201d Catt said. Petersen said the finding that public school funding had not increased as much as private schools was an \u201cenormous disappointment\u201d, but he was not surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to me because this is exactly what we\u2019ve been warning against for well over a decade,\u201d he said.

But it also meant schools have limited ability to provide other crucial staffing resources which can help build a child\u2019s learning capability for the rest of their lives, such as psychologists, occupational therapists and speech pathologists. He said this was a resource most critical in schools located in rural and remote areas where these services were limited compared with metro areas. Murphy said he was also seeing the consequences of state governments not reaching their obligation to fund public schools at 80%. \u201cThe disappointing fact is the Queensland government has not lifted from 89.6% of the school resourcing standard for students in Queensland,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Naplan results are not moving, we shouldn\u2019t be blaming schools, we should be blaming a system that underinvests.\u201d", "Annastacia Palaszczuk digs in with \u2018ruthless people\u2019 swipe as leadership speculation swirls [2023-09-11T15:00:10Z]": "When Annastacia Palaszczuk says she is \u201cabsolutely determined\u201d to lead Labor to another election in Queensland, no one has any doubt that she means it. \u201cI feel refreshed, I feel energised,\u201d the Queensland premier said on Monday, returning from leave to address worsening polls and growing unrest among government MPs. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely committed to this job; I\u2019m committed to this state.\u201d   Related: Annastacia Palaszczuk reveals \u2018medical episode\u2019 but says she is determined to lead party to election    Facing reporters alone in Brisbane after the government\u2019s regular Monday cabinet meeting, Palaszczuk dug her heels in.

But Labor MPs agitating for change remain unconvinced, as polls show the government heading towards a comprehensive election loss. The most recent, a RedBridge Group poll published at the weekend, showed Labor\u2019s primary vote had dropped to 26% statewide. The government trails the LNP opposition 55-45 on a two-party basis. Raw numbers rarely tell the real story in Queensland, where election swings in the city have often moved in the opposite direction to regional parts of the state. The RedBridge poll divides the results into three amorphous regions \u2013 the south-east, central and north \u2013 and it shows Labor\u2019s vote dropping everywhere. The Liberal National party currently holds only four seats in greater Brisbane, yet is outpolling the government by almost 13 points in the city and surrounds. The Greens\u2019 primary vote is hovering at 16% across the south-east, and is likely much higher in the inner-suburbs where several Labor seats are under threat. \u201cWe are going backwards everywhere, and at the point where we need to start talking about sandbagging,\u201d a Labor source said. \u201cThe premier was always going to fight to stay on.

Guardian Australia on Tuesday revealed that the ringleader of the group, Torin O\u2019Brien, is the former president of a group that regularly posted offensive anti-Islam content online. O\u2019Brien referred to himself online as part of the \u201cInfidel Legion\u201d and made comments calling Muslim people \u201cknuckle draggers\u201d.

We\u2019ve seen that before. What you see on social media is not evidence and the people feeding this don\u2019t have the skills or the knowledge or the information that police have in doing their jobs.\u201d Carroll pointed out the strain caused by the vigilante behaviour on police resources, after a wall of officers was present to stand between the angry crowd and the Rockhampton house. \u201cYou looked at the amount of police that were there yesterday, they would be better off spending time investigating [the alleged crimes] themselves and working out in the community,\u201d she said. Queensland police have repeatedly cautioned against vigilantism, with local officers warning Toowoomba and Townsville locals against such behaviour. Carroll said the death of Jennifer Board, who was allegedly killed by a man involved in a \u201cvigilante\u201d pursuit, had shown the \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences of taking the law into your own hands.

Asked to condemn the vigilante behaviour, Palaszczuk would only say she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d. \u201cWe acknowledge that people have very strong feelings about this in their local community but there are police there that are on the ground, that are there to serve the community, and to actually \u2026 resolve these issues. \u201cSomeone could get hurt, there could be unforeseen consequences \u2026 \u201cWe should allow the police to do their job.\u201d The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, urged against vigilantism but said he would not condemn the behaviour because \u201cthe community is at breaking point\u201d and he didn\u2019t wish to \u201cpour fuel on the flames\u201d. \u201cNo one wants to see vigilantism in the community \u2013 full stop, end of story,\u201d Crusafulli said. \u201cWhat I want to see is more police to be able to do the job and the laws for them to be able to actually keep the community safe.\u201d", "NSW must help Reserve Bank \u2018slay the inflation dragon\u2019, state treasurer says [2023-06-19T07:53:21Z]": "New South Wales must do its part to curb inflation and help the Reserve Bank \u201cslay the inflation dragon\u201d, the state\u2019s new treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, says. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s statement on the NSW budget, Mookhey also said the Minns Labor government would place a major investment fund set up by its Coalition predecessors under review and halt further cash injections into it. Mookhey said tomorrow\u2019s speech would provide further \u201cdiscoveries\u201d to the $7.1bn \u201cblack hole\u201d of unfunded or hard-to-avoid expenses he had inherited. While plugging the gaps where possible, it was also important to rein in spending.   Related: NSW government delays budget after uncovering $7.1bn in fresh \u2018financial pressures\u2019    \u201cIf we don\u2019t get our spending under control, we run the risk of the [Reserve Bank] continuing to put up interest rates month after month which means our mortgage holders will be effectively making a bigger sacrifice to fight inflation,\u201d he told a media conference in Sydney. The RBA earlier this month raised its key interest rate for a 12th time in 13 months and warned that \u201csome further tightening of monetary policy may be required\u201d to curb inflation. Unlike the federal government \u2013 which is on track to post a surplus in the 2022-23 year \u2013 states haven\u2019t faced as much scrutiny about their spending. NSW accounts for about a third of the Australian economy, with an annual gross state product of about $770bn. The state\u2019s net debt is about $80bn, or about half that of Victoria. Queensland\u2019s finances, though, are healthier because of a special tariff imposed on coal royalties that NSW has ruled out. Mookhey said the Labor government had gone to the March elections with a promise not to increase royalty rates for the 2023-24 year and \u201cthat remains our approach\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Unlike Queensland, most of NSW\u2019s coal is thermal used in power plants rather than coking coal used in steel mills. Extra royalties would have an impact on consumers\u2019 power prices, he said. After its election, the government opted to delay this year\u2019s budget until September to examine the previous government\u2019s spending plans. Much of Tuesday\u2019s speech will focus on the review of the debt retirement fund, created by the NSW Generations Fund Act set in 2018 \u201cto help lower the debt burden for future generations\u201d. Mookey said the fund had the potential to cost billions of dollars while also creating \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d that masked the true state of the budget. The previous government had planned to borrow as much as $25.3bn to deposit into the fund \u2013 or about half the $60bn in total debt sales \u2013 over the next four years. \u201cNSW stands to lose billions if the economy faces a shock akin to Covid-19 or the global financial crisis, sending the value of those investments lower,\u201d he said. Stripping out assumed profits the fund would have paid into state coffers, the annual surplus projected at $311m for the 2024-25 year instead becomes a deficit of $911m, Mookhey said. For the following year, the forecast $824m surplus becomes a $601m deficit. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can use this money to pay our bills to pay our essential workers a pay rise, to pay for our schools, or pay for our hospitals,\u201d he said. The government will ask for a \u201cshort\u2019\u201d upper house inquiry and will use its findings to \u201cdetermine final settings\u201d for the fund before the September budget. Martin Foo, a director at rating agency S&amp;P Global, said borrowing money to invest in the fund did \u201cadd market risk to the state\u2019s budget over time\u201d. Projections had put the fund swelling to $90bn by decade\u2019s end. The fund seems like a good idea when interest rates \u201clooked like they were going to be low forever\u201d, he said. Mookhey said the cost of borrowing had risen about 10-fold from the Covid-era lows. The shadow treasurer, Damien Tudehope, said the government was \u201crobbing the future to pay for today\u201d. \u201cThe taxpayers of NSW should be concerned that the savings responsibly invested for the future are going to be raided to pay for Labor\u2019s unfunded election promises,\u201d Tudehope said. \u201cThe treasurer needs to rule out any move to abolish the NGF and assure NSW taxpayers that the fund will remain in place for the purpose of debt retirement.\u201d", "Reserve Bank will have to raise interest rates again because inflation still too high, IMF says [2023-11-01T02:40:33Z]": "The International Monetary Fund says the Reserve Bank will have to increase interest rates again because Australia\u2019s inflation rate on current settings won\u2019t slow to within the 2%-3% target range until early 2026.

Abdoul Wane, the IMF\u2019s mission chief, declined to say how much higher the RBA\u2019s main interest rate \u2013 now at 4.1% \u2013 would have to increase.

An increase would end a pause of four months since the central bank last hiked rates, the 12th rate rise since May 2022. The RBA will base its decision in part on an update of its forecasts, with the full quarterly statement on monetary policy due out on 10 November. The RBA\u2019s August forecast has inflation falling to within the bank\u2019s target range by mid-2025. According to the IMF, however, inflation would only return to the RBA\u2019s target band by the first quarter of 2026. The fund based its estimates on \u201cexpectations from the market\u201d but these were \u201cnot very far from what the RBA has in mind\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Guardian Australia approached the RBA for comment. Last week, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed prices for the September quarter were 5.4% higher than a year earlier, more than economists had predicted. The IMF\u2019s assessment was based on meetings over the past fortnight with the RBA, finance officials in Canberra, banks and others in the private sector. It will release a final report in January. The fund found Australia\u2019s economy to be \u201cresilient\u201d even as GDP growth was to slow to 1.25% in 2024 \u2013 a figure in line with the RBA\u2019s current estimates. The nation\u2019s fiscal deficit had \u201ccontracted at a faster pace than in other advanced economies\u201d, with the commonwealth retaining \u201cthe majority of improvements\u201d from higher commodities prices rather than spending them. More could be done though, such as improving the coordination of infrastructure projects to ease price strains. Among the upside risks were \u201chigher migration, faster execution of public investment, and an acceleration of housing price increases that can boost consumer sentiment and household consumption through wealth effects\u201d, the fund said. More housing supply was needed, Wane said. Data out on Wednesday showed the total number of dwellings approved fell 4.6% in September, in seasonally adjusted terms, reversing part of the 8.1% rise in August, according to ABS data.   Related: Australian property prices soar to record levels despite higher interest rates     Australia\u2019s property prices have continued to rise through much of 2023 to record levels or above even with four more RBA rate rises crimping the ability of many people of borrow, two research groups said on Tuesday. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the IMF had \u201cbacked the Albanese government\u2019s responsible budget management and highlighted our targeted policies to address cost-of-living pressures\u201d. \u201cThe independent assessment supports the government\u2019s strategy of banking the majority of revenue upgrades when the inflation challenge is most intense,\u201d Chalmers said. The IMF said governments would need to cut deficits and promote economic efficiency over the \u201cmedium term\u201d, with greater use of \u201cunderutilised indirect taxes\u201d one option. It backed property taxes over stamp duty at state level to promote housing affordability and improve the tax base. To address global heating, the IMF backed an economy-wide carbon price or, failing that, \u201cstrong sector policies\u201d putting a price signal on carbon. The Albanese government\u2019s new safeguard mechanism to tackle industry emissions was \u201can important milestone\u201d but the IMF said it should \u201cconsider gradually expanding the coverage of the mechanism to a greater share of the economy\u201d and noted the \u201cintegrity of carbon offsets\u201d was key.

Daniel Mookhey, New South Wales\u2019 treasurer, unveiled a mid-year budget update for his state on Thursday showing the deficit for the 2023-24 year had ballooned by $1.7bn to $9.6bn since the budget was released three months ago. Of that larger deficit, about half came from lower projected investment returns, with higher interest rates adding $500m to debt servicing and cuts by the Commonwealth for 17 scrapped or revised infrastructure projects costing $400m this year alone, with an estimated reduction in grant revenue of $3.2bn.

Given the forecast\u2019s conservative commodity price estimates, though, a second consecutive budget surplus looks likely. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for the federal government to be bragging about returning to surplus after breaking the hearts of many people who expected their infrastructure investment,\u201d Mookhey said, adding he couldn\u2019t guarantee his government would pick up the tab for all 17 of the affected projects.

Mookhey said NSW\u2019s GST transfers would be hit by lower consumption as higher interest rates hit households. Decisions by the Minns government had only contributed $169m, or about 10% of the budget\u2019s deterioration for this fiscal year. Higher property and land prices were the main drivers for a $138.6m upward revision in projected taxation revenue for this year, with the four-year outlook boosted by $2.8bn.

Scripture Union Australia has warned the decision would probably result in cuts to chaplaincy services after Labor allowed its deductible gift recipient (DGR) status, previously granted by the Morrison government, to lapse. The largest provider of school chaplains, Scripture Union Queensland, had been the subject of a complaint to the tax office questioning whether it had breached its tax deductibility status to collect $33m in donations.

The ATO has never revealed the outcome of the complaint, citing secrecy provisions in taxation legislation. The Morrison government temporarily fixed the potential defect in the 2021-22 budget by specifically listing the chaplaincy provider for DGR status from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2023. In early July, SU Australia revealed this status had not been extended, and as a result it \u201cwill no longer be able to issue tax-deductible receipts for donations made [after 1 July 2023] to support a chaplain\u2019s in-school hours\u201d. In an update to its website, since removed, SU Australia explained that \u201csince mid-2000 the [ATO] has allowed your financial donations for chaplaincy in public schools to be tax deductible\u201d. \u201cHowever, the ATO has since changed its stance on this.\u201d The group chief executive of SU Australia, Peter James, said the decision of the federal government to decline its request \u201cwill likely mean some cutbacks to chaplaincy services, however it is too early to predict to what extent\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWhile chaplaincy receives government funding, SU can only provide the number of chaplains, hours and services because of the donations made by thousands of community supporters,\u201d he said.

Since its election in May 2022 the Albanese government has reformed the $60m-a-year program by allowing schools the option to choose either a professionally qualified secular student welfare officer or chaplain. Queensland Parents for Secular State Schools (QPSSS) has argued the fact SU Australia no longer accepts tax deductible donations for chaplaincy is further evidence for the complaint made to the Australian Taxation Office in 2018 that it inappropriately allowed donors to claim a tax deduction. QPSSS complained that Scripture Union Queensland claimed to be able to receive donations to its ministry fund for the \u201cfurtherance of religious instruction in government schools in Australia\u201d, despite the fact the chaplaincy program is based on pastoral care, not religious education.   Related: Queensland Uniting church minister opposed to same-sex marriage loses unfair dismissal claim    QPSSS said that \u201cschool chaplaincy was an ill-conceived and poorly designed program from the outset\u201d.

Police brought a charge against the boy, who is of African descent, alleging he was one of five teenagers who entered a woman\u2019s room and demanded money in October 2021. He was accused in court of being armed with a steering wheel lock.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Children\u2019s court judge Vicki Loury threw out the case on Wednesday, on grounds that material witnesses were not asked to provide statements or called to give evidence. Loury\u2019s written judgment laid out police \u201cfailures\u201d to conduct basic investigations into the incident, and said explanations for those failures were \u201centirely unsatisfactory\u201d. The judgment said police made \u201cno effort\u201d to confirm the boy\u2019s account \u2013 that he was visiting a neighbouring property \u2013 when he spoke with an officer on the night of the incident. Police located the steering wheel lock in the complainant\u2019s room, but did not seize the item as evidence or conduct a forensic examination. \u201cThere is no explanation in the evidence for that not having occurred,\u201d Loury said. Senior constable Brooke Mair, who took over the investigation into the incident about nine months later, collected CCTV evidence from nearby homes. \u201c[The CCTV] footage, or even stills taken from it, was not tendered in evidence,\u201d the judgment said. Under cross-examination, Mair was asked why police had not obtained statements from multiple people who might have been able to shed light on whether the boy was present. These included the complainant\u2019s brother and friend, who were both at the premises on the night of the incident, and residents at the neighbouring property where the boy stated he was at the time. \u201c[Mair] confirmed that she spoke to the complainant\u2019s brother to try to get a statement from him. In the end, she did not bother as it was too hard with her rosters to obtain a statement from him. \u201cShe did not attempt to obtain a statement from the complainant\u2019s friend \u2026 She did not bother to follow up the defendant\u2019s claim that he was visiting [the neighbouring property]\u2026  \u201cI consider the explanations given for the failure to call the complainant\u2019s brother to give evidence or the complainant\u2019s friend \u2026 and the failure to call any of the residents from [the neighbouring property] to be entirely unsatisfactory.\u201d \u2018Risk\u2019 that boy was wrongly identified The charges were brought on the basis of evidence from the complainant, who identified the boy as among the group that entered her bedroom and demanded money. But the court found there were \u201cweaknesses\u201d that undermined the reliability of the identification evidence. Earlier on the day of the incident, the complainant had seen the boy in a park with four others, all of Sudanese background, who were later involved in the home invasion. \u201cThe complainant described all of the males in the park as being dressed in the same way wearing Nike style clothing including a jacket or hoodie. All of the males had similar styled hair. The defendant\u2019s hair is quite distinctive. \u201cThere is a risk that the complainant, having seen the defendant with a group of males earlier in the day, four of whom were involved in entering her bedroom later that evening, has jumped to a conclusion that the defendant was one of those boys.\u201d The complainant was unsure in her evidence how many people had entered the room, saying there were \u201cabout five or four of them or six\u201d. The judgment said the complainant, in her statement to police, had not described the defendant as being armed with any object. \u201cIt was in a conference with the prosecutor on the morning of the trial that she said that it was the defendant who was armed with the steering wheel lock. This change in her evidence adds weight to the possibility that her memory is unreliable and she might be mistaken as to the defendant\u2019s presence.\u201d", "Guardian Essential poll: Labor maintains large lead over Coalition despite budget failing to impress voters [2023-05-15T15:00:48Z]": "The Albanese government has a commanding lead over the Coalition, 53% to 42% in two-party-preferred terms, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. \nTaken after the release of Labor\u2019s first full-year budget on 9 May, the poll also found that less than one quarter of respondents (24%) think the budget will be good for them personally, although that is up eight points since the same question was asked in November, after the October budget. \nThe poll of 1,080 voters, released on Tuesday, finds a further 5% of voters are undecided.

Police are conducting an internal investigation into the death of the 30-year-old by suicide inside the Beenleigh police holding cells on Saturday. The incident has raised questions about the implementation of police procedures and checks, including whether the man should have been under constant observation.

Police did not respond to questions about how the man had been classified, or whether the classification by watch house staff was appropriate. However it is understood the investigation is looking at whether checks were adequate. The Courier-Mail reported this week that the investigation would look into how frequently the man was checked. Every prisoner \u2013 even in the lowest risk category \u2013 must be checked at least once an hour.

Of these allegations, one involved a situation linked to domestic violence and was part of an ongoing professional standards investigation.  \u201cInformation access breaches are not tolerated in the AFP,\u201d a spokesperson says. According to data released by New South Wales police, there have been more than 1,000 complaints about potential unlawful access and improper disclosure of police information since 2020 \u2013 although there may be duplicates where an incident included both allegations. Assistant commissioner Peter Cotter, the commander of the professional standards command, says the NSW police force acknowledges the approximately 1,000 complaints, and the number is \u201cconsidered to reflect an accurate identification of those employees who have breached the trust afforded to them\u201d. Cotter says NSW police have safeguards in place, including audit processes and training. \u201cWhen such matters are identified, a full and comprehensive investigation follows \u2026 and where there are significant and severe breaches they are investigated criminally,\u201d he says. Two broad categories of misuse In NSW, the internal police data system is called the Computerised Operational Policing System, or Cops. Thirty-six officers have been charged with \u201caccessing or modifying data held in computer\u201d between 2020 and March 2024. Samantha Lee, a supervising solicitor at the Redfern Legal Centre, says the number of complaints in NSW suggests \u201cthat unauthorised access to information is a systemic issue that needs immediate attention from law enforcement\u201d. There are several cases now before the NSW courts concerning alleged misuse of Cops, including an officer who is defending charges of domestic violence offences and accessing or modifying restricted data. Police allege he checked Cops to search information related to his then girlfriend and her family and friends.   Interactive   Another officer allegedly used his position to have a sexual relationship with a woman and also allegedly used Cops to access details about other individuals, knowing it was unauthorised. Estelle Petrie, a lawyer with Robinson Gill Lawyers with a focus on police misconduct, says she has seen two broad categories of misuse in her work: officers who use these internal systems to track down people they\u2019ve met while working, and officers who use it as part of family violence and other offending. \u201cThey use it as their own private library,\u201d she says. \u2018It\u2019s just data, \u201cwhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d\u2019 Lydia Shelly, the president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, says she is concerned about the lack of public information about incidents of abuse of police data \u2013 a situation she says \u201cerodes public confidence in the police\u201d. \u201cThe lack of information concerning these incidents is disturbing, given the high numbers exposed through the FoIs, and there should be an increased level of transparency,\u201d she says. After Guardian Australia\u2019s FoI request, the Northern Territory police said that information about misuse of police data does not exist in \u201ca documented format\u201d. Western Australia police force denied the FoI request on the basis that such information would be held by the internal affairs unit, which is exempt from disclosure. However, the state\u2019s Corruption and Crime Commission says there have been 406 allegations made against employees of WA police regarding alleged \u201cunlawful use of computer\u201d from 2019-20 to date. The WA police force has \u201czero tolerance of fraud, corruption or misconduct\u201d, a spokesperson says. \u201cAll reports of misconduct are robustly investigated and are overseen by the CCC.\u201d Victoria police, meanwhile, advises that FoI requests now take on average 35 weeks to complete. That squares with the experience of Emma*, whose partner pleaded guilty to family violence offences in 2020. She obtained an apology from Victoria police after her safety plans to escape interstate with her children were leaked to her abuser and his colleagues, but says she faced delays getting her records from police. In Victoria, 68 police and one protective services officer were charged with criminal and/or discipline matters relating to the misuse of police databases between January 2020 and June 2024. Of these, three police were charged relating to \u201cfamily violence information\u201d. Emma now works with the Independent Collective of Survivors. One change she pushed for was a recent change to the Victoria Police Act, which extended the 12-month limit on when an officer can be charged with misuse of the Victorian police database, called Leap, to three years. \u201cEven Vicpol couldn\u2019t tell you the extent of the problem, because they\u2019re not monitoring it,\u201d Emma says. \u201cIf you are really taking misconduct seriously, if you are taking police perpetrators seriously and stalking seriously \u2026 you put those controls in place.\u201d A 2019 report from the police oversight body the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac), which looked at unauthorised access and disclosure of information held by Victoria police, found it is likely underreported. Leap administrators receive an alert if employees access records for someone with the same surname, or if employees look up the file of someone under investigation by another unit. Ibac said in 2019 these kinds of alerts were \u201cof limited use as a deterrent\u201d. Petrie says there still hasn\u2019t been sufficient change within Victoria police. \u201cThis idea that it\u2019s just data, \u2018what\u2019s the harm?\u2019, is influencing the way they respond to this issue,\u201d she says. A Victoria police spokesperson says it is committed to meeting its FoI obligations, and has increased the department\u2019s resources. It also has \u201cstringent measures in place\u201d to ensure the proper use of Leap, including proactive monitoring, extensive records of who has accessed the system, restrictions on especially sensitive information, and tiered levels of access. \u201cThis strong oversight means the number of Leap breaches is relatively small, given the millions of legitimate uses every year,\u201d the spokesperson says. Not just family violence The cases before the courts have heard varied reasons for access to internal police databases. In 2022, the police officer Jayden Faure was among the first Victorian police officers to be sentenced in relation to Leap misuse. He pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office after accessing the Leap database on multiple occasions, including to look up the background of women after they approached police for help. He was sentenced to a three-year community corrections order. In November, the Blue Mountains officer Ricky Dean Heness, 31, pleaded guilty to unauthorised access to restricted data after accessing the Cops database. He looked up information multiple times about a woman he knew, according to court documents. He told police he did it for \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d. He was convicted but no further penalty was imposed.

In 2005, Malcolm Craig was waiting in line at his local hardware store in Alexandria, Sydney, when he says someone pushed in front of him, prompting consternation from other shoppers. The man confronted Craig, wrongly believing he had made derogatory remarks, and they had what a police report later called a \u201cverbal altercation\u201d. Craig walked out of the store to avoid the confrontation. The man followed him out to where there was a woman sitting in a van nearby \u2013 the man\u2019s partner. He drove away. Not long after, Craig woke up and found his house damaged and every panel of his car had been scratched. The scratches were deep, right down to the metal, he says. He later found out the man\u2019s partner, the woman in the van, was a police officer. Worried they knew where he lived, Craig filed a complaint and requested an internal investigation. The heavily redacted report of that investigation, seen by Guardian Australia, found the female police officer had engaged in misconduct by calling another officer and \u201crequesting personal information\u201d from Cops linked to Craig\u2019s number plate. Craig hasn\u2019t asked for much in the years since. All he wants is for the NSW police and the state government to pay him back for the damage caused to his car and for the stress and anxiety he suffered. He applied for an ex gratia payment in 2019, which was declined by NSW police because his losses were \u201cnot caused by government actions\u201d. He then initiated court proceedings but says he was forced to drop the case when he ran out of money. \u201cI\u2019m not even asking for much,\u201d he says. \u201cJust pay back the damage you did by letting out my sensitive personal information.\u201d Craig has also been left oblivious as to the fate of the officer. His efforts to get answers out of NSW police and the state government have yielded little, in his view. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a shit, quite frankly,\u201d Craig says. Sarah says she tried to report her now former partner to police several times, but claims she wasn\u2019t taken seriously and he was never charged. \u201cEvery sort of investigation was either abandoned or went nowhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re just a law unto themselves.\u201d * Names have been changed \u2022 Do you know more?

As he reasons, it\u2019s all he can hold on to.  More than a decade after being forcibly removed to Papua New Guinea by Australia, Chawdury is still there, one of the last remaining cohort who make up the unhappy ragged tail of Australia\u2019s illegal offshore detention regime in that country. Chawdury arrived in Australia by boat in 2013, fleeing the violence of partisan politics in his native Bangladesh. His membership of a political party made his life unsafe and he sought sanctuary in the first refugee convention country he reached.    But Chawdury spent just days in Australia before he was exiled to detention on Manus Island. He was told it would be temporary, a stopgap while his claim was assessed and a resettlement place found. \u201cWe were told we would be there only for a short time. But we had an interview and then we just wait \u2026 we wait one year, one-and-a-half year, and still no answer,\u2019 Chawdury says. \u201cWe were imprisoned. My mental state was horrible \u2013 it was beyond description \u2013 and physically there were no doctors, no medical treatment. If we were ill, we were just ill, there was no help for us.\u201d Chawdury\u2019s claim for refugee protection was swiftly recognised. Australia was legally obliged to protect him. Despite this, Chawdury would spend more than six years on Manus before being moved to Lorengau, then to Port Moresby.   Related: Refugees in PNG told they will be evicted next week after Australian-sponsored housing bills not paid    Chawdury has watched fellow refugees die through murder, medical neglect or suicide, or abandon their protection claims to take their chances in a dangerous homeland. Others have left for new lives in Australia, the US, Canada and New Zealand. But he still waits. \u2018Some days we eat, some days we don\u2019t\u2019 In 2020, assured his resettlement was proceeding, he was joined by his family from Bangladesh, his wife and a daughter whom he had known only as a baby. Another child followed. \u201cWhen they first came, I was very happy to see my family, but they couldn\u2019t go anywhere and we have just been waiting since that time. Nothing has changed.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Chawdury landed a job at a supermarket \u2013 work that gave him purpose and a place in his community, and that allowed him to provide for his young family. But that ended suddenly in January when riots erupted across Port Moresby.    Chawdury has the CCTV footage of rioters forcing opening the security doors to his shop before flooding in, stripping the shelves bare and destroying the building. He was caught in the middle of the mob, powerless to stop it.  \u201cEvery time I close my eyes, I see them attacking me, I think I am surrounded by them, every time I close my eyes,\u201d he says. A life on the fringes has retreated further. His daughter is not able to attend school \u2013 she does not have the right documents, he says, and cannot obtain them \u2013 and she needs medical attention that she is rarely able to obtain. Often, they have been turned away from hospital. His wife suffered a miscarriage at three months but was refused hospital treatment despite what Chawdury says was excruciating pain, until he begged a senior official to assist.  Chawdury says his family does not feel safe. \u201cIn Port Moresby, my family went out twice and twice they were attacked, their bags were snatched. \u201cSo my family just stays in the room all day, every day. I go out \u2026 but they never do. They just stay.\u201d Without work, and with the Australian money that was supposed to support refugees exhausted, Chawdury\u2019s family\u2019s existence is increasingly precarious. \u201cThings are very bad at the moment, it is very hard. Some days we eat, some days we don\u2019t eat,\u201d he says.   Related: \u2018Unjust and cruel\u2019 lack of clarity still hangs over 64 refugees exiled in PNG    \u201cBecause immigration has cut off all services, we have nothing besides this place to stay \u2026 we have no money for food or for transportation \u2026 and then there is no medical help for my family: if a person gets sick in the family, they will not treat them. \u201cIn the meantime, if the landlord comes and gives us eviction notice again \u2026 we will be on the streets.\u201d  Secret deal with PNG Since the Manus Island detention centre was ruled unlawful by the PNG supreme court in 2016, Australia has tried to push legal responsibility for the remaining refugees and asylum seekers on to PNG. In December 2021, the Morrison government signed a secret deal with PNG to fund the welfare and support of those sent offshore by Australia. The Albanese government has refused to reveal its detail: a freedom of information request was denied because the information \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause damage to the Australian government\u2019s international relations\u201d. The money \u2013 however much it was \u2013 came from Australia\u2019s $303m irregular maritime arrival \u201coffshore management\u201d budget. A Department of Home Affairs spokesperson says: \u201cThe department does not have any role in the ongoing management of, or service delivery arrangements for, individuals remaining in PNG.\u201d The spokesperson says it is the responsibility of the PNG government to \u201cindependently manage individuals remaining in PNG on a permanent or temporary pathway\u201d.    \u201cIndividuals in PNG have resettlement pathways, including the United States, New Zealand and Canada, or permanent settlement in PNG.\u201d The department refuses to say how many of the nearly 1,400 people Australia sent to PNG remain there. Guardian Australia understands there are 52, as well as a number of their wives and partners, and 28 children. Four want to stay in PNG, three are within the \u201cprocess\u201d of moving to the US, 19 to New Zealand and seven to Canada. But nearly two dozen have no \u201cpathway\u201d to resettlement. Australia\u2019s claim that those remaining are the responsibility of the PNG government is not supported by international law. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees has repeatedly told Australia it \u201cremains jointly responsible\u201d with PNG for their treatment and welfare.    Madeline Gleeson, a senior research fellow at the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales Sydney, says secrecy around the terms of Australia\u2019s agreement with PNG makes it hard to determine the legality of Australia withdrawing care from the men left there. But she says the original agreement \u2013 the basis on which the men were sent to PNG \u2013 required commitments from both countries about resettlement. \u201cAustralia cannot simply \u2018contract out\u2019 of its obligations by paying another country to do what it should be doing itself, particularly given it was well aware of the limitations of PNG\u2019s refugee settlement capacity when it made the secret agreement,\u201d Gleeson says. Australia maintains it paid the PNG government all the required money to manage the refugee cohort during the 2021-22 financial year, to allow PNG to manage its budget over subsequent years. But the money ran out months ago, and Australia has consistently said it will not pay any more. Last year a whistleblower from within PNG\u2019s immigration authority alleged the Australian-sponsored program to care for refugees exiled to PNG had been riven by corruption, fraud and nepotism, and that all the money \u201chas been depleted or gone missing\u201d. The PNG government announced an investigation and the then chief migration officer, Stanis Hulahau, said the allegations were \u201cfalse\u201d and without evidence. He said Australia should pay further money because the rate of resettlement to third countries had been slowed by Covid. Hulahau has since resigned. \u2018Climate of violence and fear\u2019 Heidi Abdel-Raouf, a spokesperson for the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, says refugees in PNG have frequently experienced discrimination, violence and theft, but now their situation was even worse. \u201cSince the recent deaths, riots and shootings in Port Moresby, the climate of violence and fear has grown more severe,\u201d she says.  Many are suffering \u201csevere anxiety, depression, PTSD, psychosis and self-harm\u201d. \u201cFor some the risk of suicide is chronically high and unpredictable,\u201d Abdel-Raouf says. \u201cA small group are acutely mentally unwell and unable to care for themselves or consent to receive support of any kind. Without electricity, food and medical care they are terrified, paranoid, frail, living in squalor and unable to communicate coherently.\u201d Abdel-Raouf says Australia could not \u201ccontinue to abdicate responsibility for this cohort\u201d and should evacuate all those who want to leave. Chawdury was interviewed for resettlement in New Zealand months ago but has heard nothing since.  \u201cI\u2019m still hopeful for resettlement in a safe country, I have to hope, for my family,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the wait is too long, and each day is too hard. I want to request Australia not to make us suffer any more in this place, to take us away from this place so that this suffering could stop.\u201d", "Perrottet\u2019s future fund for children risks increasing poverty divide, social advocates say [2023-03-12T14:00:04Z]": "The New South Wales government\u2019s cornerstone election policy, which aims to help the next generation pay for housing and education, has been criticised by social advocates who claim the scheme will further entrench inequality. The Kids Future Fund would see all children 10 and under handed an account with $400 in it, with the government to match parents\u2019 future contributions of up to $400 every year until the age of 18. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, claimed individual accounts could reach $28,000 by the time a child enters adulthood if $400 was added by their parents every year. That could reach $49,000 if parents stumped up the maximum allowed contribution of $1,000 a year.

However, the NSW Council of Social Service chief executive, Joanna Quilty, said the impact on individuals of the $850m scheme would depend on the means of each family. \u201cWith housing stress rife across NSW and the cost of everyday essentials sky-rocketing, low-income families \u2013 particularly those living below the poverty line \u2013 don\u2019t have any money to spare,\u201d she said.   Related: Dominic Perrottet announces \u2018future fund\u2019 for NSW children as cornerstone of Coalition\u2019s re-election pitch    \u201cMy concern is that this policy risks further increasing the poverty divide \u2013 where wealthy families can take advantage of this initiative to bolster their child\u2019s financial future, while poorer families are left behind. \u201cWe would strongly advise the NSW Coalition to consult widely on this policy to ensure it doesn\u2019t further entrench social inequality.\u201d Money from the accounts would be available for use from the age of 18 for education, including the paying down of Hecs debt or the purchase of a property. The chief executive of the Community Housing Industry Association, Mark Degotardi, said it failed to deal with the challenges already facing young people, with at least eight years until any child would be helped. \u201cMuch of that benefit will depend on how much your parents can afford to put into a savings fund on your behalf,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a policy that is completely out of touch with what is actually happening to families in NSW right now.\u201d Degotardi said the government needed to help the young people who were homeless, living in care or struggling to keep up with rising rents and the cost-of-living crisis. Grattan Institute economist Brendan Coates was concerned the policy would give \u201can extra leg up\u201d to children from wealthier families. \u201cPoorer families \u2013 those who most need support with both education costs and housing \u2013 are the least likely to have the cash to spare to contribute,\u201d he said. The money would be better spent to support young people from poorer families to pursue further education once they turn 18, he said. Coates noted the government\u2019s plan to automatically contribute $200 a year to the child\u2019s account if their parents are receiving the commonwealth family tax benefit was not a bad idea but the co-contribution model was problematic.   Related: \u2018I feel so abandoned\u2019: the \u2018safety net\u2019 overlooked in NSW election promises on housing    \u201cThis is exactly how co-contribution schemes in super play out: they largely benefit wealthier households with the cash to spare, whereas those with low super balances struggling to get by don\u2019t make extra contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s little evidence that co-contribution schemes actually encourage more savings overall.\u201d Labor also took aim at the scheme it claimed was doing nothing to deal with the problems of the day including the teacher and housing shortage. The opposition Treasury spokesperson, Daniel Mookhey, said: \u201cIt seems as though the families that need the help the most will benefit the least from this policy because they don\u2019t have the money to put into this account.\u201d The policy would cover all children aged 10 and under in 2023 \u2013 almost 1 million \u2013 and would then apply to about 100,000 babies born in the state every year.

If only | Greg Jericho [2024-05-15T15:00:44Z]": "Remember all that talk about wage-price spirals? About wages driving inflation? All that worry about a wages breakout causing interest rates to rise? Ahh yes, good times. It seems that many commentators and economists love fairytales, and the story that wages were causing inflation was never true and the figures released on Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show just how much of a struggle it is for wages to keep up with inflation.   Related: Australia budget 2024: the six graphs you need to see | Greg Jericho    In December annual wage growth hit 4.2% \u2013 the fastest since 2009. Such strong growth brought with it the usual suggestions that wages were growing too fast and the Reserve Bank would be ready to hit the interest rates brakes. Well, relax. The March quarter figures show annual growth of 4.1% and all signs are that 4.2% was the peak.       If the graph does not display click here Some of the commentary surrounding the budget has been that the government has different economic predictions than the RBA\u2019s. The jury is still out on who will be most accurate on their predictions of inflation but, on wage growth, the government looks likely to win the prize. The RBA estimated that by June wage growth would be 4.1% while the government has predicted 4.0%. Wage growth is likely to fall again because the figures show that in both the public and private sectors there have been exceptional one-off increases in the past year but quarterly wage growth is slowing:       If the graph does not display click here The growth remains mostly in the private sector \u2013 with public-sector wages growing faster only in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania \u2013 and even in those three states the difference is marginal. By contrast the average wage growth of public servants in South Australia and the mostly commonwealth public servants in the Australian Capital Territory lags well below their counterparts in the private sector:       If the graph does not display click here The wage growth over the past year across most industries has been faster than inflation but in the March quarter wages in the finance and utilities industries were the only ones to grow faster than prices:       If the graph does not display click here Wages overall in the March quarter grew 0.8%, which was slower than the 1% rise in inflation. As I have noted often over the past two years, it is impossible for wages to drive inflation when they are actually rising slower than inflation! That said, over the past year the 4.1% wage growth is ahead of the 3.6% growth of prices. But the figures also show that this notional increase in real wages will not have been equally felt. In the 12 months to March the average prices of non-discretionary items (rents, energy bills, petrol, food, etc) went up 4.2%. For those on low and middle incomes who spend more of their income on these items, there will have been little to no increase in real wages. The biggest improvement will be for those who spend more of their income on discretionary items.       If the graph does not display click here But even with that, the average growth of real wages is pitiful:       If the graph does not display click here The mere 0.5% real wage growth over the past year is not even at the level it was during 2013-16 when nominal wages growth kept falling, let alone the stronger growth we had during the mining boom years. Remember that wages are supposed to grow faster than inflation \u2013 it is how living standards grow. But with such weak real wage growth it will take a long time to recover the living standards lost over the past few years. In March the value of Australians\u2019 wages was equivalent to that in September 2010. In effect you can only buy the same amount of things now with your wage as you could 14 years ago. Or, to put it another way, the average wage now buys 5% less than it did in March 2020 before the pandemic hit.       The good thing is the budget predicts further real wage growth over the next four years. But, even still, the budget papers predict by June 2028 the value of the average wage will only be back to the level it was in 2014. In effect we have lost 14 years of progress on living standards and, unless real wages grow faster than they did before the pandemic, we shall continue to be that far behind until the middle of next decade. A wages breakout? Please. If only.  Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work ", "Experts hope AI tool can cut use of restraints and seclusion on NDIS participants [2024-05-04T20:00:52Z]": "Australian researchers hope a new AI-supported educational program will help reduce the use of restraints and seclusion on people with disability. The Promoting Positive Behaviour Support Practice program is designed to help practitioners create safer, respectful, constructive plans to guide carers and support workers\u2019 responses to challenging behaviour. \u201cChallenging behaviour\u201d includes destructive acts, self-injury, aggression or any behaviour at a level of repetition or intensity that may place a person with disability at risk of harming themselves or others.   Related: \u2018Outrageously scary\u2019: NDIS participants fear proposed changes will give them less choice and control    \u201cThis behaviour is people with disability using the best means they have to try to communicate that something is not right for them,\u201d the University of Melbourne\u2019s Prof Keith McVilly, who worked on the project, said. \u201cThey\u2019re in pain, they\u2019re unwell \u2026 they\u2019re not being listened to, and we\u2019ve failed to provide the support they\u2019re looking for. These behaviours are a last resort.\u201d The disability royal commission heard harrowing stories about people subjected to restrictive practices. In the 2021-22 reporting period, 1.4m instances of unauthorised restrictive practices used against 8,830 NDIS participants and 5.58m instances of authorised use against 8,685 people. Restrictive practices can include confining a person to a room or physical space (known as seclusion), the use of a device to restrict a person\u2019s movement, physical restraint by another person or the use of medication.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The NDIS watchdog has identified the abysmal quality of most behaviour support plans \u2013 which are submitted to the commission as part of the regulatory process \u2013 as a key problem. The commission\u2019s 2022 audit found that more than 80% of the plans were either weak or underdeveloped, especially when it came to identifying positive or therapeutic ways to address the person with disability\u2019s needs, and nearly 70% of plans included no consultation with the person with disability at all. The new program allows behaviour support practitioners to upload segments of their draft plans into a tool \u2013 developed using natural language processing and machine learning models \u2013 that then analyses the plan and provides feedback. When bad practice or areas for improvement are identified, the program directs the practitioner back to specific components of the online educational resources. \u201cThe idea is they\u2019re being almost coached by the AI in conjunction with the educational resources, so that by the time they submit the plan it should be a functional or compliant plan,\u201d McVilly said. The program came out of a collaboration between the University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, and Flinders University, and was funded by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. It was developed partly as a response to the increased use of restrictive practices. Catherine McAlpine, the chief executive of Inclusion Australia, said people with disability \u201ctend to not know that they even have a behaviour support plan, let alone see them\u201d. \u201cThere can be a tendency for practitioners and providers to be more focused on the behaviour control rather than understanding of the context and factors that are driving the behaviour,\u201d she said. \u201cBehaviour support plans can end up being about fixing the behaviour, rather than fixing the drivers of that behaviour, or the problem that actually needs to be solved.\u201d McVilly agreed. \u201cGood science shows us [that] we\u2019ve got a huge possibility of reducing challenging behaviour if we just understand what it\u2019s about and can appropriately respond. It sounds simplistic, but it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s never done, or not as thoroughly as it should be done,\u201d he said. McAlpine said it was positive to see projects aimed at improving the quality and processes of developing behaviour support plans, but she had questions about the role the NDIS commission would play in ensuring they yielded material improvements for people with disability. \u201cWhat requirements might there be on practitioners in terms of improvement? What monitoring of a decrease in restricted practices will there be?\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cOur experience is that voluntary processes tend to result in good people doing better, which is great, but in others still not addressing fundamental issues, such as upholding people\u2019s human rights.\u201d A spokesperson for the NDIS commission said it was \u201ccommitted to improving the quality of specialist behaviour support\u201d. \u201cWe use a range of regulatory powers and functions as set out in the NDIS Act 2013 and Rules to raise the quality of behaviour support plans, promote the reduction of restrictive practices, and hold providers accountable where breaches of the NDIA Act and associated Rules are identified,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "Dinosaur skull found in Queensland belonged to sauropod that roamed almost 100m years ago [2023-04-11T23:48:02Z]": "A 95m-year-old dinosaur skull discovered in Winton, Queensland, has been identified by palaeontologists as the first nearly complete sauropod skull ever found in Australia. The skull belongs to a Diamantinasaurus matildae dinosaur, nicknamed Ann, that lived between 95m and 98m years ago. It is only the fourth specimen of this species ever discovered. The study\u2019s lead researcher, Dr Stephen Poropat of Curtin University, said it was \u201creally amazing to be able to find a skull at all \u2013 they\u2019re quite rare, and even more so to get so much of one that had been preserved\u201d.    Sauropods were a group of long-necked dinosaurs that included Brachiosaurus and Brontosaurus. They had small skulls relative to their body size, with delicate skull bones. \u201cThey would have been a good target for a predatory dinosaur or even a scavenging animal,\u201d Poropat said. \u201cThey would have looked at a sauropod carcass and [thought]: \u2018The easiest thing to take away is their head.\u2019\u201d He said that with previous sauropod discoveries, \u201cYou\u2019ll sometimes follow a string of neck vertebrae and come to nothing at the end of it because the head had gone.\u201d    Diamantinasaurus matildae was a titanosaur, a type of sauropod that included the largest land animals in historical existence. The discovery of the Diamantinasaurus skull enables scientists to recreate for the first time what the dinosaur\u2019s face may have looked like. \u201cIn some ways, the head looks very much like that of Brachiosaurus,\u201d Poropat said, noting there were some differences in shape and its teeth. \u201cBecause [Diamantinasaurus] has a rounded snout instead of a squared-off snout, we can say it was a generalist browser \u2013 it was not feeding close to the ground habitually.\u201d \u201cWhen we see sauropods that were low feeders, they tend to have much narrower teeth, they tend to have snouts that are sort of squared-off, almost like vacuum cleaners.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Diamantinasaurus skull had many similarities to another titanosaur, Sarmientosaurus musacchioi, which lived in South America around the same time. \u201cYou could almost put Sarmientosaurus\u2019s head on Diamantinasaurus\u2019s body and barely be able to tell the difference,\u201d Poropat said. The researchers believe the discovery reinforces a hypothesis that during the mid-Cretaceous period \u2013 95m to 100m years ago \u2013 sauropods traversed between South America and Australia, using Antarctica as a pathway. \u201cBecause the world was extremely warm \u2026 the poles were vegetated, not covered in ice,\u201d Poropat said. \u201cIt would seem that sauropods took advantage of this really warm period.\u201d Ann likely measured 15 metres to 16 metres long from head to tail. The maximum size for Diamantinasaurus is about 20 metres long, 3 to 3.5 metres high at the shoulders, with a weight of 23 to 25 tonnes. \u201cAs far as sauropods go, they\u2019re medium-sized,\u201d Poropat said. \u201cThe largest [sauropods] push 40 metres in length and 80 tonnes in mass.\u201d    The Diamantinasaurus skull was found during a dig in 2018 but has remained unreported until now. The process involved taking off topsoil after finding bone fragments at the surface. \u201cWe started finding mostly limb bones and vertebrae, but around one of the limb bones there were scattered small bones and \u2026 it was hard to place what they were,\u201d Poropat said. Mel O\u2019Brien, a volunteer, then found \u201ca really weird-looking bit of bone that we eventually realised had to be a brain case. That then made all the other bits fall into place \u2013 we realised that we had a skull that had basically exploded and the bits were scattered around the back leg bones.\u201d The excavation was conducted in collaboration with the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History, citizen scientists and volunteers.

Palaszczuk was in Mackay on Thursday to unveil details about the proposed Pioneer-Burdekin project, which will take about a decade to plan and build. She said the 5GW project was the \u201ccentrepiece\u201d of the Queensland energy plan announced Wednesday, which envisages large-scale construction of renewables and the early closure of coal-fired generators. Under the plan, reliance on burning coal would cease by about 2035.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  However the Pioneer-Burdekin project remains in the very early stages and still requires significant planning and funding. The government said while it was confident the proposal is viable, it would continue to assess potential backup options.   Related: Queensland government pledges to end reliance on coal-fired power by 2035    The estimated cost for the project is $12bn. The Queensland government is yet to commit any money, though the project would probably not begin construction until 2025 at the earliest. It is expected the state would seek a significant federal contribution to the construction cost. \u201cI\u2019ve had very preliminary first conversations with the prime minister, and I know how much he is interested in nation-building infrastructure,\u201d Palaszczuk said. Queensland Hydro, the new government entity designated to build the project, is expected to complete detailed geotechnical and environmental studies in 2024. In the meantime, the organisation will \u201calso continue to investigate other large-scale, long-duration pumped hydro sites in the event the project is unable to proceed,\u201d a government statement said. On Thursday Palaszczuk and the state\u2019s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said about 50 homes would be inundated under the plans, which involve the construction of three reservoirs. Negotiations will need to be conducted with the land owners and with Indigenous traditional owners. Environmental groups have largely welcomed the state\u2019s renewable ambitions outlined in the energy plan. But some have also raised concern about the impacts of projects like the Pioneer-Burdekin. The Mackay Conservation Group on Thursday said it was concerned about the local environmental impacts of the project. \u201cAll of the water in the Pioneer catchment is already fully allocated for farmers, drinking water, and environmental flows,\u201d said the group\u2019s coordinator, Peter McCallum. \u201cThere simply is no available unallocated water to operate a pumped hydro scheme under the Pioneer valley water plan. One of these stakeholders will have to suffer. \u201cWe are also very concerned about the impacts that any clearing for the project will have on the iconic Eungella national park which is one of the jewels in the crown for Mackay biodiversity and tourism.\u201d Palaszczuk said part of the attraction of the site west of Mackay was that farmland and cane fields \u2013 rather than national parks \u2013 would be inundated to create the reservoirs.   Related: \u2018Field of dreams\u2019: Queensland plans to build Australia\u2019s largest publicly owned windfarm    She described the project as \u201cthe battery of the north\u201d.

Preliminary estimates for the year to 31 March 2023 indicated emissions totalled 464Mt CO2-e, or 0.2% lower on a rolling 12-month tally, the national greenhouse gas inventory shows.

Falling emissions from stationary energy, such as that used in manufacturing and gas heating in homes, all retreated in 2022, easing back 1.5% or 1.6Mt CO2-e. As Covid restrictions eased, transport emissions gained 4.9% or 4.4Mt CO2-e, last year, led by people taking more flights.

Data provided to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show that since Australia\u2019s borders reopened following easing of Covid-19 restrictions phone searches rebounded as the number of travellers increased. There were 2,087 searches in the 2021-2022 financial year, 5,065 in 2022-23, and 4,422 in the period between 1 July 2023 and 31 March 2024.

There is no limit on how long the devices can be held but the agency said the policy was to keep devices for no longer than 14 days unless it took longer to examine them. Guardian Australia reported in May that one man, Chris*, was stopped three times in a year upon returning to Australia from the United States on a visit to see family. He described the behaviour as highly invasive and unnecessary harassment. During the most recent search, he said the threat of seizing the device was used to attempt to compel him to hand over his passcode.

Gregory Stuart Lynn, 57, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Russell Hill, 74, and Carol Clay, 73, at a remote camping site in the Wonnangatta Valley in March 2020. Closing arguments in the double murder trial began on Tuesday in the supreme court. Crown prosecutor Daniel Porceddu told the jury that the prosecution\u2019s case was about the \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201cprotracted series of actions taken by the accused to disguise his involvement in and the manner of their deaths\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cThe most extreme of those actions is the burning of the bodies,\u201d he said. But the defence argued the prosecution\u2019s case was \u201cincreasingly desperate\u201d, had broken the established rule of fairness in the court, and failed to demonstrate that evidence the former pilot gave to police was false. Porceddu said Lynn\u2019s actions after the alleged murder were designed to remove \u201cforensic evidence which could reveal anything about the manner in which they died\u201d. \u201cHe knew he had murdered them and, if the scene had been left as it was, the forensic evidence would reveal that fact,\u201d he said. Porceddu told the jury to remember that, due of Lynn\u2019s actions, very little forensic evidence remained. He said the prosecution\u2019s case rested on established evidence, not testimony from Lynn\u2019s 2021 police interview, after his arrest.    Porceddu told the court the prosecution rejected Lynn\u2019s account that the deaths were \u201ca series of unfortunate events\u201d. \u201cLike the book series of that name, it is all complete fiction,\u201d he said. Porceddu said Lynn\u2019s account was implausible that, by the former pilot\u2019s account, Hill had gone from \u201ccordial to homicidal rage\u201d despite other campers describing the elderly man as a \u201cfriendly\u201d person who \u201cloved to chat\u201d. \u201cHe would not have approached Mr Lynn, he would have made himself safe,\u201d he said. He said Lynn\u2019s story about an altercation that turned fatal was implausible because, by his account, Hill confiscated his shotgun despite raising concerns about him deer hunting with his rifle. The prosecution said Lynn\u2019s account that Hill also found the right ammunition for the shotgun and then loaded it was implausible. \u201cIf Mr Hill\u2019s plan was to confiscate the firearm, he would put it in his car, canopy or tent. So why load it?\u201d Porceddu said. Porceddu told the jury that during Lynn\u2019s police interview, he never mentioned the presence of a rope tied between the bull bar of Hill\u2019s Toyota Land Cruiser, where the former pilot says was where they struggled over the shotgun, and a tent used as a toilet. He said, by Lynn\u2019s account, the pair would have become entangled in the rope. Lynn last week told the court he didn\u2019t see it and it did not get in the way. But Porceddu said the rope \u201cruins the whole account\u201d. \u201cThe so-called struggle for the gun is the whole linchpin in the accused\u2019s story. Once that falls like a house of cards, everything else tumbles with it,\u201d he said. He said the prosecution did not know the exact motive or circumstances around the alleged murder, but told the court \u201cit was common sense to conclude there was a disagreement\u201d, likely over Hill\u2019s use of a drone. Porceddu said Lynn then killed Clay because she was a witness in the violent murder of Hill. On Tuesday afternoon, Lynn\u2019s lawyer, Dermot Dann KC, told the court his client had answered 1,200 police questions and provided more than 1,000 pieces of information as he told the truth about the elderly camper\u2019s deaths. He told the jury he would take them through the \u201ctop 17 lowlights\u201d of the prosecution\u2019s case. He said this included the failure to elicit evidence that did not support the prosecution\u2019s \u201chalf-baked theory\u201d, including that Hill had experience with shotguns. Dann said the prosecution had asked no questions about Hill\u2019s long battle with depression and instead depicted a picture of a man who was as \u201chappy as a pig in shit\u201d. He also referred to deer hunters who had testified that Hill told them retirement had \u201cfucked him up\u201d. Dann described Hill\u2019s attitude to the Wonnangatta Valley as: \u201cI make the rules around here.\u201d He referred to a deer hunter who testified he saw Hill use a chainsaw to cut firewood from a snowgum. The court previously heard that when the hunters told Hill that it was illegal to cut that timber, he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d   Interactive   Dann previously told the court the deaths were the result of a tragic accident, and that his client had \u201cmade a series of terrible choices\u201d to cover them up. Lynn\u2019s account is that Clay was shot in the head after he and Hill struggled over control of the former pilot\u2019s shotgun after a dispute. Lynn, the defence\u2019s only witness, told the court last week that, after Clay was accidentally killed, Hill then dropped the gun. He said Hill then came towards him with a knife and, while the pair struggled, it accidentally plunged into the older man\u2019s chest.

The bank now expects the first RBA cash rate reduction to come in February. Until Monday, the ANZ was in line with CBA, NAB and Westpac in forecasting that a cut would land this November. \u201cThe stronger-than-expected [March quarter inflation reading] makes it hard to see the RBA being sufficiently confident that inflation will return to and stay in the band by the time the November meeting comes around,\u201d said Adam Boyton, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics.

CBA estimates the economy added 30,000 jobs last month, enough to keep the jobless rate at 4.1%. \u201cLeading indicators of employment and the labour market more generally such as GDP growth, job ads and private sector surveys suggest conditions will continue to loosen this year,\u201d CBA said. NAB\u2019s monthly business survey, also released on Monday, found the \u201csubdued economic activity\u201d at the start of 2024 had extended into the current June quarter. Business confidence had turned negative and business conditions were just below the long-run average. Consumer-facing sectors such as retail and personal services were among the weakest both in terms of conditions and forward orders, NAB said. \u201cDespite the softening in activity, capacity utilisation remains above average, which suggests the process of bringing supply and demand back into balance remains incomplete,\u201d Alan Oster, NAB\u2019s chief economist said.   Related: GDP growth falls to just 0.1% as household cutbacks put handbrake on Australia\u2019s economy    Oster said there were \u201creasons to be very wary about the inflation outlook\u201d. The NAB survey found labour cost growth quickened to 2.3% in the past three months from 1.5% in April. Purchase costs and product prices also both increased at a faster pace. \u201cWe have been wary for some time that the path of inflation from here is likely to be gradual and uneven, and the survey results really reinforce this message,\u201d he said. One bright spot in the business survey was an improvement in the employment index for the month, lifting it back above average. The labour market \u201cremains a point of strength for the economy\u201d, Oster said. Another bright spot has been car sales. In first five months of 2024, vehicles sales were up 12% from a year earlier to 512,753, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said. Sales in May alone set a record for a second year in a row.

The Australian Financial Security Authority told the council insolvencies for individuals and companies, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, had risen over the past year. \u201cThis followed a period where insolvencies had been well below usual levels reflecting the significant support measures put in place during the pandemic, including those from the ATO,\u201d AFSA said.", "Peter Dutton\u2019s plans will breach the Paris agreement on climate \u2013 that much is clear | Adam Morton [2024-06-10T15:00:17Z]": "Peter Dutton plans to breach the text and spirit of the landmark Paris climate agreement, backed in 2015 by a Coalition government along with the leaders of more than 190 other countries. \nThis should be clear to anyone who clicks on this link and reads the deal reached in the French capital.  \nDutton did not say in an interview with News Corp published on Saturday that he would formally pull out of the agreement if the Coalition won the next election. But he did confirm a position that would put Australia at odds with what it sets out to do. \n \n  Related: Peter Dutton accused of trying to \u2018rip up\u2019 Australia\u2019s commitment to Paris climate agreement  \n \nSince this was pointed out by people with decades of experience at highly technical climate negotiations, the Coalition has responded with a mix of half-truths and falsehoods. \nBoth Dutton and Ted O\u2019Brien, the opposition climate change and energy spokesperson, say a Coalition government would be committed to the agreement but reject the national 2030 emissions target \u2013 that is, a minimum 43% cut below what emissions were in 2005. \nA bit on the target: Labor took it to the 2022 election after asking the consultants RepuTex to calculate what its policies would deliver. It was legislated with the support of the Greens and independent MPs after they made an evidence-based argument that Australia should be doing more. It was also submitted to the UN as a pledge. \nHere\u2019s what the Paris agreement says about these pledges, known in UN lingo as \u201cnationally determined contributions\u201d: that countries will build on them over time. Article 4.3 of the agreement says each commitment a country makes will be a progression \u2013 an improvement \u2013 and \u201creflect its highest possible ambition\u201d. Article 4.11 says a country can adjust its commitment \u201cwith a view to enhancing its level of ambition\u201d. \nIt means countries can increase commitments at any time they like, but there should not be backsliding. \nThe climate crisis is already fuelling heatwaves, extreme weather and potentially extraordinary and catastrophic changes in natural systems. In Paris governments accepted the scientific and economic evidence that the threat and cost of climate change to lives, livelihoods and the natural world was escalating. They agreed they needed to ramp up action, not put it off. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nDutton and O\u2019Brien seem to ignore this part of the Paris agreement, and instead argue the Coalition is committed to the deal because it would stick to a target of net zero emissions by 2050. \nThis is misleading. In addition to including net zero \u2013 expressed as aiming for a global balance in the second half of the century between the greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere and the CO2 we draw out of it \u2013 the agreement emphasises the need to act rapidly, with new national pledges every five years. It says countries will aim to hold the increase in average temperatures since preindustrial levels to well below 2C and try to limit it to 1.5C \u2013 a level that we have already nearly reached. \nPromising to do less now, having few if any policies to reduce emissions before 2040 and planning for Australia to in the meantime pump hundreds of millions of additional tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere would be the opposite of being committed to this goal. \nThe country will face no direct penalties under the UN process if it goes down Dutton\u2019s path \u2013 or, for that matter, if Labor stays in power but misses its target. National pledges under the Paris agreement are not binding in this way. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nBut John Connor, who helped Fiji run the UN climate negotiations between 2017 and 2019 and now leads the Australian Carbon Market Institute, says the Coalition\u2019s plan to weaken a commitment under the Paris deal would be historic. No other country has done it. \nExperts say the ramifications could include Australia being diplomatically isolated \u2013 a return to the days of the Morrison government, when it was grouped with laggards such as Russia and Saudi Arabia on climate. It would, by design, hurt the country\u2019s ability to attract the hundreds of billions of dollars in private investment needed to replace fossil fuels and build new, clean industries. \nIt could also lead to Australian businesses facing additional costs as other countries \u2013 the European Union, for example \u2013 impose carbon tariffs on goods from nations that are not acting on the climate crisis. \n \n  Related: Labor\u2019s strategy is to reduce emissions from gas \u2013 but not if that means doing anything to cut its use   \n \nIt is worth also examining the Coalition\u2019s claim that it is committed to net zero emissions. Is it really? We haven\u2019t seen its policy yet, but it is promised to be pro-gas \u2013 adding new emissions \u2013 and pro-nuclear. \nDutton has reportedly now conceded that no nuclear plants will be built before 2040. The CSIRO and others say they would be hugely expensive. The overseas experience says it would be hugely difficult to get up. But the Coalition\u2019s position appears to be that this industry will emerge in Australia after 2040 to deliver net zero emissions in less than a decade. \nIn the real world, reaching net zero will require painstakingly detailed work across nearly everything the country does \u2013 electricity generation, manufacturing, heavy industry, transport, buildings, waste, agriculture. \nWe will get a better idea of where Labor stands later this year, when it has promised to release emissions reduction plans for each sector of the economy. To be successful, they will need to vault the country beyond what is now proposed. There is no sign that the Coalition is considering similar work. \nOne final point: Dutton and O\u2019Brien say they would not back the national 2030 target because it is \u201cunachievable\u201d, \u201cnot working\u201d and a \u201cLabor lie\u201d. \nIt\u2019s reasonable to question whether the country is on track to meet the target given the challenges in quickly building the transmission lines and large-scale wind and solar farms needed to get there, and Labor\u2019s approval of new fossil fuels developments. \nBut departmental projections released in November estimate that announced policies could take the country to a 42% cut by 2030. \nThey suggest that the 43% target is achievable, just not guaranteed. And at this point the only thing certain to make it unachievable is having no policies to get there.", "\u2018The model is broken\u2019: Brisbane live music venue the Zoo to close after 32 years [2024-04-30T23:37:40Z]": "The Brisbane music venue the Zoo will call last drinks in July, with the owner listing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of forces leading to its closure, including cost-of-living pressures and declining alcohol consumption among young people. The 500-capacity room, which first opened its doors on Ann Street in 1992 in the formerly down-at-heel but now heavily gentrified inner suburb of Fortitude Valley, is one of Australia\u2019s oldest music venues. The Zoo\u2019s sister venue, the 250-capacity Stranded, will also close its doors at the end of this week. Stranded, housed in the same building as the Zoo, was named after the 1976 debut single by the legendary Brisbane band the Saints.   Related: \u2018If you came to The Zoo, you respected the rules\u2019: is this Brisbane music venue the best in Australia?    The Zoo\u2019s owner, Shane Chidgzey, said the venue\u2019s current revenue was at roughly 60% of the previous financial year. \u201cThe model is broken, unfortunately, when it comes to music venues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only make money on alcohol sales. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cost-of-living crisis in Australia, which is huge \u2026 And there\u2019s a new trend of not drinking, which is a wonderful trend for health but not so good for bars.\u201d The Zoo\u2019s booker, Nathan Farrell, told the Guardian in March that while more tickets were sold in 2023 than in any year in the Zoo history, the amount of money people were spending on drinks once through the door was well down. Chidgzey also cited audiences saving their money for big-ticket international artists including Taylor Swift, as well as the skyrocketing cost of insurance, which had nearly doubled in the past two years from $35,000 to $65,000.    Chidgzey said the venue\u2019s increased insurance costs were partially driven by the venue\u2019s location in a safe night precinct, a Queensland government initiative to curb alcohol-related violence in entertainment zones that began in 2014. There has been only one insurance claim in the venue\u2019s history.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Zoo\u2019s location in the precinct, Chidgzey said, put it at a profound financial disadvantage. \u201cIt requires additional security, it requires ID scanners, it requires more regulation, your insurance is more expensive and your rent\u2019s more expensive,\u201d he said. Other comparable venues such as the Tivoli, also in Fortitude Valley, the Triffid in neighbouring Newstead and the Princess Theatre in South Brisbane are not in the safe night precinct, according to Chidgzey: \u201cThey\u2019re working on a completely different cost basis to us.\u201d He also called for the introduction of a levy on major international touring artists to subsidise the grassroots music industry. \u201cThey need to be putting a dollar transaction per ticket on that to put into local music.\u201d The venue\u2019s original owner Joc Curran, who ran the venue from 1992 to 2016, said: \u201cThe Zoo was an impossible thing, that became possible because of community, love, and a belief that magic could happen \u2026 but now it is time to say goodnight.\u201d Curran said she was only one of the venue\u2019s custodians, paying tribute to her original co-owner C Smith, Chidgzey, the former owners Pixie Weyand, Cat Clarke and Luke \u201cBoo\u201d Johnston, as well as the \u201cZooies\u201d \u2013 a term of endearment for the venue\u2019s long-term staffers.    Robert Forster, who co-founded the Brisbane band the Go-Betweens with the late Grant McLennan in the late 1970s, said the Zoo was \u201cthe first well-run, stable, encouraging, well-organised venue in Brisbane that I\u2019d ever encountered\u201d. \u201cPermanence had very little to do with the Brisbane scene up until the 1990s, and it really started with Joc and C going down to the Valley.\u201d Forster moved back to Brisbane from Germany in 1992, the same year of the Zoo\u2019s inception. \u201cIt had a tonne of atmosphere and it always felt like a meeting place and a hangout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was great that it was one storey up above the whole mad, ugly chaos of the Valley.\u201d   Related: Australia\u2019s live music scene \u2018decimated\u2019, with 1,300 venues lost since pandemic    Later, after McLennan also moved back to Brisbane, he and Forster formed a new lineup of the Go-Betweens which made its debut at the Zoo in December 1995. Other notable shows at the venue included an early 1996 performance by Nick Cave with the Dirty Three (marking the beginning of Cave\u2019s working relationship with Warren Ellis) as well as appearances by a young Ben Harper and Pixies.

It led MPs to call for an urgent parliamentary inquiry into the impact of advertising by harmful industries, including gambling, on children and young people, and also prompted many parents, including Wendy, to share their stories. Wendy says she and her husband tried to stop their son from gambling but he would turn to his friends for money instead, and they would charge him interest.

Each of the parents has a child aged between 11 and 17. \u201cParents are concerned, particularly around how children see gambling as a way to make money, and that comes back to the way that the ads are presenting gambling as a fun, social and easy way to make money,\u201d McCarthy says. McCarthy and other public health experts say that, particularly in the online space, celebrity endorsements, influencer endorsements and \u201crisk-reducing\u201d promotions such as cash-back offers are having the most impact on young people, by prompting them to think that gambling has little or no risk attached to it.

Like the tobacco industry, this includes political donations, corporate social responsibility strategies and lobbying.  The independent MP Zoe Daniel has been advocating for publication of all ministerial diaries in real time so voters can see the industry representatives and lobby groups their elected representatives are meeting with. Guardian Australia asked the offices of the federal health minister, Mark Butler, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and the social services minister, Amanda Rishworth to provide details on the number and nature of meetings they have held with gambling industry representatives, including gambling companies, broadcasters, other media organisations and sporting codes. None of the ministers\u2019 offices would provide the information. \u201cTo refuse to do so sits uncomfortably with the prime minister\u2019s post-election promise to \u2018change the way\u2019 we do politics,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for state governments in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania to publish minister\u2019s diaries so should the Albanese government. \u201cWe do know that gambling outfits, media companies and sports organisations have ready access to ministers \u2026 this is not the case for advocates for a ban on the scourge of gambling advertising.\u201d    It appears to be the new normal.

Landlords will only be able to increase rents once a year, rather than every six months, under reforms introduced to the state parliament on Tuesday. On Tuesday the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the measure will \u201cgive people who are renting a fairer go\u201d, but appeared to back away from earlier comments that the government was \u201cvery seriously considering\u201d capping the amount rents can increase each time.   Related: \u2018Unprecedented\u2019: domestic violence shelters reach capacity amid Queensland housing crisis    The government also announced a suite of tax concessions for property developers, including slashing their land tax in half for 20 years, if one in 10 units in their development were to be for \u201caffordable\u201d housing. Other available tax concessions include a full exemption on the 2% foreign investor land tax surcharge for two decades. The government will also provide an additional $28m to continue the Immediate Housing Response Package for another year.    The chief executive of the Queensland Council of Social Service, Aimee McVeigh, welcomed the proposal to limit increases to once a year but said a rent cap was needed to stop \u201cpotential price-gouging.\u201d \u201cGiven the extraordinary circumstances Queenslanders are finding themselves in, we really need to tie rent increases to CPI increases, similar to what is already happening in the ACT,\u201d she said. \u201cUnaffordable rents and the lack of housing supply is pushing families into homelessness, and we need the government to step in under these extreme circumstances and go further with rental reforms.\u201d Queensland\u2019s Make Renting Fair campaign has been calling on the government to use the consumer price index (CPI) as the benchmark to limit rent increases. But the proposal was met with fury by developers, the real estate industry and the Courier Mail, which dubbed the measure a \u201cdunce\u2019s cap\u201d. The state\u2019s opposition also last week organised a press conference with the chief executive of the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, Antonia Mercorella, who lashed the move as \u201ca thought bubble\u201d. But the chief executive of Tenants Queensland, Penny Carr, said the rent cap put forward by the campaign was \u201cmoderate\u201d and would \u201cmaintain returns for landlords \u2026 whilst providing stability to tenants\u201d. Carr said 195 people had sought advice from Tenants Queensland about rent increases between January and March. The average rent increase was $100 \u2013 the largest being $705 a week \u2013 with only 15 people having rent hikes below the rate of the CPI. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased the premier is focused on this issue and support her proposal to limit rent increase frequency to once per year. However that alone will not stop the price gouging we\u2019re seeing in parts of the market,\u201d Carr said. The executive director at Q Shelter, Fiona Caniglia, said she feared the outcome for tenants if no limit was placed on the amount that rent can increase. \u201cWhile the increasing costs of mortgages are impacting property investors, tenants are being pushed to the brink of homelessness by the scale of rent increases that can occur,\u201d Caniglia said. Caniglia said \u201cwhile property investors have enjoyed capital gains, tenants have not been able to stretch their incomes\u201d. \u201cQ Shelter has heard from property investors who have chosen not to increase rents and are pushing back at proposals to charge excessive increases,\u201d Caniglia said. \u201cWhile this is commendable, it doesn\u2019t replace the value of having certainty through legislation.\u201d   Related: After criticism for \u2018reviewing, not doing\u2019, Queensland\u2019s government is now announcing policies on the run    In parliament on Tuesday the Greens MP for South Brisbane, Amy MacMahon, made a failed attempt to suspend standing orders to bring on urgent debate of her rent freeze bill \u2013 which is separate from the rent cap others are calling for.

The travel card, introduced by the Perrottet government, was meant to help apprentice tradies and students buy fuel and pay for travel but Aitchison was no fan and had previously called it a \u201cjoke\u201d.

Balancing act If you\u2019re a prominent ABC journalist every move you make on and off air is scrutinised, particularly at the moment when tensions over the Israel-Hamas war are running high. The ABC was forced to defend Radio National Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas for asking cabinet minister Tony Burke for his thoughts on use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d in relation to the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza. The Australian reported that the interview \u201cleft members of the Jewish community \u2018sickened\u2019\u201d. But this week ABC news director Justin Stevens went further in his defence of the broadcaster, saying she was subjected to online trolling and abuse of a \u201csexualised, homophobic and racist\u201d nature. \u201cFor a major national media outlet to compound that abuse by publicising it and publishing personal photos to illustrate it is irresponsible and unjustified,\u201d Stevens said in reference to two Daily Mail articles about Karvelas\u2019 personal life which included a photograph of her wife. The Mail stories were based on an ABC interview with Karvelas about how she felt she could not be entirely open about her sexuality early on in her career. \u201cShe tried to be ambiguous when talking about her private life, especially when using pronouns to discuss her partner,\u201d the ABC reported of the young Karvelas. Not known for its subtlety and nuance, the Mail turned the comments into headlines about \u201cher life as a lesbian journalist\u201d, but editor Barclay Crawford said the Mail published two \u201cbalanced, totally legitimate articles\u201d based on an interview one of the ABC\u2019s most prominent broadcasters had given. \u201cThe first was based off the interview she gave to ABCQueer and the second was based on her own \u2018X\u2019 commentary to her 161k followers,\u201d Crawford told Beast. \u201cBoth stories were clearly newsworthy. \u201cThe statement by the ABC points to a growing culture of hubris and navel-gazing that is frustrating taxpayers who spend more than $1bn a year bankrolling the national broadcaster.\u201d Stevens did not name the Mail but said media outlets \u201cshould be combatting dangerous online abuse and gender-based and sexual bullying, and standing in solidarity with peers experiencing it, not disingenuously serving to amplify it\u201d. In March, Stevens accused News Corp and the Daily Mail of amplifying misogynist social media abuse by publishing articles that included \u201cvile\u201d Twitter criticism of an outfit worn by News Breakfast host Lisa Millar. The Karvelas articles did not include any of the Twitter abuse. GB News\u2019 round-the-world trip If you\u2019re not a fan of rightwing news you may be dismayed to hear GB News, the UK\u2019s rightwing channel run by former Sky News Australia chief Angelos Frangopoulos, is going to be broadcasting from Australia. The outfit is never out of the headlines. Over the weekend it was announced Boris Johnson was taking a paid job as a presenter for GB News, a month after the channel suspended a presenter after he went on a misogynistic on-air rant about a political journalist. The good news is the channel, which is already available here on the streaming news service Flash, is only operating from Australia in the purely technical sense.

Endangered drama This week SBS announced it had two new local dramas for 2024, Swift Street and Four Years, and next week the ABC\u2019s new head of content, Chris Oliver-Taylor, will unveil his first slate for the new year at a showcase for journalists. The public broadcasters do their best to produce original drama on increasingly limited budgets but the number of titles and the length of each production is shrinking.    According to the drama report released this week by Screen Australia, Nine produced two dramas last financial year but only one, Warnie, has aired this year. Our reviewer Luke Buckmaster gave Warnie a rare one-star review when it premiered in June. \u201cBut nothing has substance here and in fact the whole thing feels a bit off, Warne\u2019s relatively recent death (in March last year) adding to a feeling that this production has been hurried down the assembly line, without much thought put into it,\u201d he wrote.

Darling Downs Health was made aware of a staff shortage at Tara hospital on 6 April that meant between 7 April to 11, ambulances with non-urgent cases were diverted to Chinchilla hospital, about 50 minutes away. Retrieval Services Queensland, which coordinates aeromedical retrieval and inter-hospital transport and the ambulance service coordinated care for urgent cases. Some of these patients were diverted to Toowoomba hospital, 175km away, and Dalby hospital, 90km away.   Related: Queensland health report suggests long Covid no more severe than lingering influenza    Tara hospital has eight available beds and offers emergency care, medical, palliative care and clinics, including outpatients services. According to the 2021 census, Tara, 250km west of Brisbane, is home to 3,851 people, 8.6% of those who identify as Aboriginal. Darling Downs Health executive director for rural health, Dr Christopher Cowling, said the district only knew of the imminent staff shortage one day prior. \u201cWe absolutely acknowledge that having a doctor available in any town is vital, which is why we took immediate action as soon as we were aware of an imminent staff shortage in Tara earlier this month,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we only knew about this one day prior to the temporary bypass, it\u2019s a real testament to the swift planning that took place in the face of unpredictable staff shortages. There are now a minimum of three doctors in Tara to provide residents with the care they deserve in both the hospital and medical centre.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Tara Emergency Centre remained open during the five-day diversion, with patients assessed and cared for by nursing staff skilled in emergency cases, which is usual practice. No one was turned away. \u201cTo ensure the most appropriate clinical care, some patients were transferred to other hospitals during this time due to the serious nature of their injuries which is not unusual for our regional hospitals as they operate as a network,\u201d Cowling said. \u201cHealth jurisdictions across the world are facing significant staffing challenges and Queensland is no exception.\u201d Guardian Australia understands that from 12 April to 14 April, a rural generalist registrar from a nearby town provided partial coverage to the hospital before full coverage was in place again from 15 April. A spokesperson for the Rural Doctors Association of Queensland said for Tara and similar sized towns, the ideal situation is doctors being available 24 hours a day.   Related: Untrained cosmetic \u2018surgeons\u2019 could face jail time under Queensland reforms    \u201cHowever, there are significant shortages of generalist doctors across rural Queensland and with less than 15% of new graduates entering generalist practice, we don\u2019t see an immediate solution, but we are continuing our advocacy to address some key issues,\u201d she said. \u201cNurses in rural areas are true generalist clinicians as well and provide excellent care for rural and remote people in these situations.\u201d She said Darling Downs Health Service should be congratulated for managing the situation quickly.

The glacial pace of the Albanese government\u2019s fast train ambitions was revealed during budget estimates late on Monday night. The project drew comparisons to Utopia \u2013 the TV series satirising the absurdity of government bureaucracy \u2013 after its chief referred questions about progress to a \u201ccorporate plan\u201d published on its website. The establishment of the High Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) was flagged by the government in its initial plans for its east coast high speed rail line, along with a commitment of $500m for planning for the Sydney-Newcastle section of the corridor to be built first.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The HSRA only formally came into existence in June, after legislation was passed paving the way for the abolishment of the National Faster Rail Agency (NFRA), a body established by the Morrison government in 2019 which did not deliver on earlier high speed rail projects.   Related: Australia\u2019s high-speed rail should be rolled out in small stages with Sydney to Canberra first, experts say    Andrew Hyles, the interim chief executive officer of the High Speed Rail Authority, told senators on Monday that detailed planning had yet to begin. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a statement of expectations that the minister has issued to us. Under that statement of expectations, we need to complete a strategic plan by the end of the year and an organisational strategy by the end of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s our focus initially, and then more detailed planning will kick off next year,\u201d Hyles said. In July, transport minister Catherine King travelled to the United Kingdom for a study tour, where she met with officials involved in the British High Speed 1 and 2 (HS1 and HS2) projects, later telling the media she had learned about potential funding models \u2013 such as through pension funds \u2013 that Australia could learn from. However, Hyles said the minister had not met with his agency since her return from the UK. When asked by Nationals senator Matt Canavan if any of the funding model advice King learned while in the UK had been relayed to the HSRA since her return, Hyles did not answer. Instead, he noted one of the agency\u2019s board members is also the CEO of HS1, \u201cso we have that expertise within the organisation already\u201d. Hyles was also unable to answer questions about a timeframe for delivery of high speed rail in Australia, instead pointing to the agency\u2019s website. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole corporate plan which is published on our website that details the work that we\u2019re doing to ensure that we get the planning right,\u201d Hyles said.   Related: NSW slams brakes on high-speed rail plans after spending $100m on studies    Canavan then quipped: \u201cI reckon we\u2019re gonna have a few scripts of Utopia by the end of all this by the look of it.\u201d Hyles revealed that interviews for a permanent CEO had been conducted, but that the board was yet to complete the hiring process. The board first announced it was working to identify its inaugural CEO on 13 June. On 26 July, King announced an advertisement for the job had been listed online. Industry insiders had cast doubt on the hiring process, telling the Guardian the advertised salary for the CEO role had been looked down upon when compared with leaders in similar roles. Hyles also told the estimates hearing that all previous projects the National Faster Rail Agency worked on \u2013 including a business case for the Melbourne-Geelong fast rail jointly committed to by the commonwealth and Victorian government \u2013 had been handed back to the department of infrastructure and transport because such projects were not deemed within the new body\u2019s remit. Fast rail is the term generally used for rail lines that achieve speeds of between 200 and 250 km/h, while high speed is anything above this. As a result, Hyles referred senators\u2019 questions about these projects back to the department. Hyles, when asked by Liberal senator Sarah Henderson if the HSRA had considered the notion of including Melbourne-Geelong fast rail within the agency\u2019s long term planning, said no, because no detailed network planning had begun.", "Farmers gear up to fight water buybacks as federal budget allocates funding to meet Murray-Darling targets [2022-10-26T15:00:06Z]": "The federal government is on a collision course with irrigators and the farming lobby after Tuesday\u2019s budget allocated an unspecified amount to meet the environmental water targets in the Murray-Darling Basin plan, likely for water buybacks. The New South Wales Irrigators\u2019 Council has warned further buybacks would \u201ccause concern among basin communities\u201d and \u201cleave food and fibre producers in a more precarious position next drought\u201d. But environmental groups welcomed the news.   Related: How northern Victoria flooded \u2013 visual explainer    Environment Victoria, Conservation Council South Australia, Queensland Conservation Council and Nature Conservation Council of NSW said it was critical that water recovery targets be met in full and on time. \u201cWith the deadline of 2024 fast approaching, environment groups encourage [federal water] minister [Tanya] Plibersek to restore voluntary buybacks as the only cost effective, practical way to return water to the rivers,\u201d the groups said in a statement. The water ministers of the basin states \u2013 Queensland, NSW, the ACT, Victoria and South Australia \u2013 met with Plibersek earlier this month amid concessions by NSW and Victoria they would fail to meet their water savings commitments by 2024. The new, undisclosed funds in the budget will give Plibersek more leverage when she meets with states again next February. But irrigators are already gearing up to fight buybacks. \u201cThe [budget] news has sent a shiver down the spine of the irrigated agriculture sector and the basin communities that depend on it,\u201d the NSW Irrigators\u2019 Council CEO, Claire Miller, said.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  \u201cIt was ironic to learn the government wants to recover more water from farmers to put more water in rivers and flood plains, whilst emergency flood evacuation warnings for basin communities were rolling across the screen.\u201cThe plan has already removed one in five litres of irrigation water [or almost one in three litres if pre-basin slan reforms are included]. This has reduced diversions for irrigation, town and industry from 35% of basin inflows to just 28%,\u201d she said.The $13bn plan relied on direct buybacks of water entitlements from farmers to achieve about three-quarters of the target. Buying back water is deeply unpopular in rural communities as it can reduce economic activity. Under a compromise, the plan envisaged using water-saving projects to provide the remaining quarter of the 2,750GL through efficiencies such as reducing evaporation. But many approved projects are behind schedule. NSW has abandoned some of its major projects, leaving it struggling to deliver its share. The NSW water minister, Kevin Anderson, said the state had a policy of no water buybacks. \u201cNSW basin communities have already done the heavy lifting when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin plan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be seeking clarification from the federal government regarding its intention for the unspecified budget funding outlined in their budget. Meeting the environmental water targets in the basin plan should not be done at the expense of NSW farmers.\u201d A spokesperson for Plibersek said all options were on the table to deliver the plan, not just voluntary water buybacks. The budget also signalled a very different approach to the large-scale rural water projects championed by the former government. Hells Gates Dam was scrapped and the Hughenden irrigation scheme deferred, while federal commitments to the NSW government\u2019s two major regional water projects, the Dungowan and Wyangala dams, were delayed indefinitely. The former government had promised to fund half of the NSW projects and had set aside $567m, but cost blowouts meant more funds would have been required. Infrastructure Australia decided the projects were not priorities and in the case of Dungowan, that the business case was not made out. Anderson insisted the NSW government \u201cremained committed\u201d to the Dungowan Dam in his seat of Tamworth. He said NSW had reserved 50% of the funding and on Wednesday the government put the environmental impact statement on exhibition.   Related: Murray-Darling Basin plan: states likely to get extra time to deliver water    NSW would continue with early works and the construction of the pipeline to ensure this project was shovel ready by 2023, he said. \u201cWe are frustrated with the delays but nothing is ever easy \u2013 we are committed to the New Dungowan Dam, while work is continuing on Wyangala Dam, and we will continue to work with the federal government to provide these critical projects,\u201d he said. NSW would be seeking a co-contribution from the federal government for the controversial plan to raise the Warragamba Dam wall, he said. But the state has said it will go it alone on the $1.6bn project. Environment groups welcomed the pause on NSW\u2019s dams. \u201cWhile it is encouraging that the federal government will not be speeding ahead with funding Barnaby\u2019s slap happy dam projects before they are costed and approved, NSW Nature Conservation Council is disappointed that some dam funding wasn\u2019t redirected into developing alternative water supply solutions,\u201d the council\u2019s CEO, Jacqui Mumford, said. \u2022 This articlewas amended on 28 October 2022 to make clear the Hughenden irrigation scheme was deferred not cancelled.", "Almost half of private school parents would consider switching to a better funded public system, survey finds [2023-10-08T14:00:46Z]": "Almost half of all parents with children in Australia\u2019s private schools would consider moving them to the public system if it were better resourced, a new survey shows. The Lonergan Research survey, commissioned by the Greens, polled more than 1,000 parents nationally with children enrolled from kindergarten to year 12. Of those with children at private schools, 48% of respondents agreed they would consider moving to a public school if they were better resourced, rising to 61% for parents with multiple children across both systems. Six in 10 (63%) parents agreed public schools were underfunded.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The findings came as the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics schools data revealed the proportion of Australian children enrolling in public schools was continuing to decline despite cost-of-living pressures hitting families. The proportion of students enrolled in government schools dropped from just over 68% in 2002 to 64.5% last year. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, said if enrolment data was \u201cnot proof\u201d of why serious reform was needed in education \u201cI don\u2019t know what is\u201d. \u201cI want public education to be the first choice of parents,\u201d he said. \u201cFunding is critical but so is what it does.\u201d The Independent Schools Australia chief executive, Graham Catt, said all sectors should be fully funded. But resourcing was not the only reason there was a continued decline in public school enrolments, he said. \u201cThe growth we are seeing in independent school enrolments is across the board \u2013 different types of schools with different levels of fees and across the country,\u201d Catt said. \u201cWe believe multiple factors are influencing parents\u2019 choices and quality education is certainly an important one. Other factors include facilities and alignment of values or religion.\u201d The Greens senator and schools spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said the results were a \u201cdamning indictment\u201d of neglect in the public system.

Key to Gonski was the Schooling Resource Standard, a needs-based model to provide a baseline education to students by 2023, set at $13,060 for primary students and $16,413 for secondary students. According to Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority data, 98% of private schools are funded above the SRS and more than 98% of public schools are funded below it. The latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development education report found Australia\u2019s investment in public schools was significantly below the OECD average, while government funding on private schools was twice the OECD average, behind only Turkey and Columbia. Australian teachers also had higher than average workloads and class sizes compared with OECD nations. The Lonergan survey also found 81% of parents were in favour of pay and conditions being improved to attract and retain public school teachers, while 71% agreed public school teachers were overworked. The Australian Education Union deputy federal president, Meredith Peace, said it was \u201cincredibly urgent\u201d public schools were funded to at least 100% of the SRS to renew confidence in the sector. She said many public school staff had left the profession due to unsustainable workloads. Clare said a target for when public schools reached 100% of the SRS would be set imminently as negotiations with state and territory governments for the upcoming National School Reform Agreement began. The agreement expires in December. \u201cWe are committed to working with state and territory governments to get every school on a path to 100% of its fair funding level,\u201d he said.", "Four Vietnamese people found near Broome as Australia\u2019s asylum boat policy under strain [2024-05-13T07:52:34Z]": "Australia\u2019s policy of deterrence against asylum seeker boats is under strain, with three boat arrivals in the last week including four people found near Broome. In addition to five Rwandans who arrived on Saibai Island and 33 people who landed on Christmas Island, Guardian Australia can reveal that four Vietnamese \u201cunauthorised maritime arrivals\u201d arrived near Broome on Friday morning. The group was intercepted just offshore. The Saibai Island group has now been returned to Papua New Guinea by charter flight. The ABC first reported, and Guardian Australia has independently confirmed, that 33 people were found on Christmas Island on Thursday morning. Their boat was destroyed by bad weather. On Monday a government spokesperson declined to say if the group of 33 had been taken to Nauru. They are no longer on Christmas Island.

Related: Rwandans arrive in Australia after perilous journey to claim asylum    \u201cAustralian Border Force have dealt with all of these issues expeditiously in a way that is consistent with Australia\u2019s public policy of strong border protection.\u201d Australia has a set of harsh border policies designed to deter dangerous boat journeys, including by people seeking asylum. Non-citizens who arrive by sea without lawful permission to enter Australia are categorised as \u201cunauthorised maritime arrivals\u201d and are never allowed to settle in Australia, even if they are determined to be owed protection under refugee conventions. Instead, they can be sent to offshore detention on the Pacific nation of Nauru and indefinitely detained until they agree to return home or are resettled in third countries, as part of a program known as Operation Sovereign Borders. On Tuesday Guardian Australia revealed the arrival of five men on Saibai Island, 4km from the Papua New Guinea mainland in the strait off Cape York in Australia\u2019s north-east. The group has claimed asylum in Australia. On Monday Guardian Australia confirmed they have now returned to PNG. It is unclear whether they will stay there permanently, or how Australia can guarantee that the men will not be returned to a country where they face persecution. The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, said the four Broome arrivals \u201crepresent yet another shocking failure of border protection under the Albanese Labor government\u201d. \u201cThis is now the sixth boat that has breached our borders and reached Australian territory in the last six months, and the 17th attempted people smuggling venture to make the journey to Australia under the Albanese government,\u201d he said in a statement. In October Guardian Australia revealed that a group of 11 asylum seekers had been sent to Nauru, the first such transfer in nine years. People smuggling ventures reached Western Australia in November and February, resulting in further transfers to Nauru and heightened political criticism by the Coalition opposition against the Labor government\u2019s handling of borders. According to the latest published statistics from September 2013 to February 2024, 1,121 people have been returned to their country of departure or their country of origin as part of Operation Sovereign Borders, to Indonesia, Sri Lanka or Vietnam. This has included at least 238 people returned in eight uses of controversial practices of taking back or turning back boats since Labor was elected in May 2022.

Social media users posted pictures of brightly coloured skies in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and around the world. Much of New South Wales missed out on the spectacle due to heavy cloud and rain.

He said hundreds of other stargazers were there \u2013 many grabbing great photos on their smartphones. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned that the storm that creates the beautiful auroras could threaten infrastructure and essential services, including power supply. The geomagnetic storm that created the \u201camazing light show\u201d was the strongest in more than 20 years, the BoM said. The BoM space weather forecasting centre manager, Kate Brand, said it was unusual for displays to be seen as far north as Mackay in Queensland. \u201cThere is a chance of seeing auras, perhaps not as far north as last night, but we are expecting that they may be visible in the southern parts of Australia,\u201d she said. Brown agreed, saying he expected another display on Sunday night, as well as the chance for a repeat on Monday.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance that there\u2019ll be a good aurora \u2013 probably not as spectacular as last night,\u201d he said. \u201cBut auroras can be really fickle. Sometimes they can disappoint and sometimes they can surprise you in a really good way, as they did last night.\u201d He recommended that people look outside if they were somewhere without much cloud cover or light pollution. \u201cAt worst, you don\u2019t see anything and at best you might see an amazing experience that you\u2019ll remember for the rest of your life,\u201d he said. A BoM senior meteorologist, Christie Johnson, said cloud cover could clear along parts of the NSW coast. \u201cThere is some potential depending on exactly how the system moves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe northern coastal area could be some breaks in the cloud and it might be OK for viewing, inland parts should be OK. Sydney is right on the edge of where we might see [it].\u201d The BoM warned that wet weather would persist for much of eastern NSW for the next few days, with flash flooding in some areas due to heavy rainfall and flood warnings issued for parts of the Hawkesbury and Nepean. Sydney\u2019s Warragamba Dam was spilling over after reaching capacity on Sunday morning. WaterNSW said the dam began spilling at 7.30am. On Wednesday and Thursday there were four coronal mass ejections from the sun, meaning highly charged plasma erupted and streamed into space. When those charged particles, known as the solar wind, hit the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they create the stunning visual displays known as auroras.

They have also argued Labor\u2019s off-budget funds are inflationary. \nThe Greens, particularly housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather, have warned the fund is not $10bn spent on housing but rather \u201ca $10bn gamble on the stock market where the volatile returns are invested in housing\u201d. \nThe Greens also point to the fact the existing future fund lost 1.2% last year, which would have translated to a $120m loss if the housing future fund had existed, with no funds released to spend on housing. \nThe independent senator, David Pocock, has said he wants \u201cmore ambition\u201d because the current plan \u201cis not going to touch the sides when it comes to dealing with the scale of the housing crisis that we\u2019ve seen in the [Australian Capital Territory]\u201d. \nIn a dissenting report in the Senate committee Pocock called for the fund to be doubled to $20bn and the $500m limit on disbursements to be scrapped. \nJacqui Lambie, whose party has two crucial Senate votes, has said they support the bill but are still in negotiations with government to improve it. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nAnd other stakeholders? \nThe construction union, which is affiliated with Labor, has said that the housing Australia future fund doesn\u2019t go far enough because its promise to create 30,000 homes over five years is dwarfed by demand for 650,000 social and affordable housing. \nThe incoming national secretary, Zach Smith, said \u201cAustralia is in the grips of one of the most serious housing crises in our history so what\u2019s on the table simply doesn\u2019t cut it\u201d.\u201cLabor must be more ambitious on social housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future fund proposal needs its funding to be dramatically increased if we\u2019re going to go anywhere near meeting the skyrocketing need for housing.\u201d \nIndustry Super Australia submitted to a parliamentary inquiry that there is an \u201cidentifiable project financing gap\u201d because \u201cit is likely more than $10 billion in additional capital will need to be found\u201d to build the estimated number of social and affordable houses. \nNevertheless, ISA supported the housing future fund as it helped \u201cguarantee recurrent funding\u201d and it could be \u201ceasily scaled over time with additional top-ups\u201d. It proposed amendments including indexing the $500m that can be released each year. \nThe housing minister, Julie Collins, has cited support from the Community Housing Industry Association, the Housing Industry Association, the Urban Development Institute, the Property Council and National Shelter. \nWhat do the Greens want? \nWith the Coalition opposed and the Jacqui Lambie Network in favour, the Greens\u2019 11 Senate votes put them in balance of power on this bill. \nThe Greens want direct investment in housing, a national plan for renters including pushing the states to cap or freeze rents, and doubling the rate of commonwealth rent assistance. \nChandler-Mather told reporters on Tuesday the Greens want an amendment to \u201cguarantee that at least $5bn is dispersed into Housing Australia every year\u201d through direct budget appropriations or out of the housing future fund. \nHe said this was a third of the $15bn the National Housing Finance Investment Corporation has estimated is needed every year. \nAfter a community door-knocking blitz over the weekend, Chandler-Mather claimed that \u201caround 80%\u201d of people the Greens spoke to said the minor party should \u201crefuse to pass their housing plan until Labor agrees to address our concerns\u201d. \nThe former Green and now independent senator, Lidia Thorpe, has asked for $1bn a year to be invested into First Nations housing. \nWhere is the bill up to? \nThe bill passed the lower house on 15 February, with Labor and crossbench independent MPs in favour. The Coalition opposed it, although the Liberal MP Bridget Archer crossed the floor to vote with Labor. The Greens abstained. \nThe bill is not likely to be voted on in the Senate until next week. \nThe Senate inquiry reported on Wednesday, with the Coalition dissenting from the Labor majority\u2019s recommendation to pass the bill. \nThe Greens also dissented, pushing for more direct investment in housing and warning the bill \u201cmust be amended\u201d. \nThe government is heaping pressure on the Greens. Albanese told Labor caucus on Tuesday that it was \u201cbeyond comprehension why anyone would vote against\u201d the bill. In question time on Tuesday, Collins urged the Senate to pass the bill \u201cquickly\u201d.", "Queensland state budget 2022: modest coal royalty hike delivers little towards energy transition [2022-06-21T04:56:19Z]": "The Queensland government\u2019s decision to increase royalties on record-high coal prices will, inevitably, be spun as a radical move. On face value, it is a brave decision. Plans to increase taxes on the mining sector have been \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 historically fraught. The resources sector has already taken out full-page advertisements in the Courier-Mail, signalling it is up for a fight. \u201cThey have been making record profits,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, told reporters before the state budget was unveiled on Tuesday. \u201cLook, I understand they might want to mount a campaign. But I believe that Queenslanders are on our side. Queenslanders will see that some of these companies are making billions of dollars on coal being exported overseas. And we can reinvest that money \u2026 into hospitals or schools and regional Queensland.\u201d   Related: Now is the perfect time to increase coal royalties to fund Australia\u2019s energy transition | John Quiggin    When it comes to the execution, however, the royalty measures will achieve little other than angering the coal lobby. The extra revenue raised \u2013 about $1.2bn predicted \u2013 is small in the context of a state whose budget bottom line is underpinned by coal royalties, and whose finances will be hardest hit by a disorderly energy sector transition. Coal prices are at record highs \u2013 the best Queensland coking coal is selling for more than $500 a tonne. The state budget predicts those high prices will net the state an additional $12bn in total coal and gas royalties over four years, compared to the same set of predictions a year ago. The changes to the royalties regime account for about a tenth of that amount. They\u2019re hardly the sort of measures that will send miners to the wall, or undermine their investment decisions. Not even close. The loudest calls for royalties reform in recent years have come from those who understand the scale of the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels. They also know that, when coalmines become unprofitable, the resources companies will cut their losses. It will be left to governments and policymakers to ensure that workers and communities, including Queensland\u2019s coalmining areas, are insulated from the impacts of the transition. The end of Queensland\u2019s 10-year royalties freeze provided a rare opportunity to ensure those coal companies help to fund the transition, having made significant profits from exporting resources that are owned by the state.

The way Labor has managed that conflict has typically been to avoid it. It talks up a renewable energy transition, but conservation groups say it has been too slow to invest or consider the need for coal power closures. The state\u2019s latest action on royalties fits in the same middle-of-the-road policy basket. Just enough to send a signal to leftwing voters in the cities who might be flirting with the Greens. Not enough to justify a full-blown scare campaign from the miners. For all Palaszczuk\u2019s talk about Queenslanders taking a fair share, the state has also been at pains to make clear that the impact of the royalty measures is mild. The treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the coal royalty measures would bring in $400m less \u2013 during a mining boom \u2013 than the last time royalties were changed by the Liberal National party in 2012. \u201cThese changes mean coal producers can rest easy,\u201d Dick said.", "Australian public school funding falls behind private schools as states fail to meet targets [2023-07-23T15:00:46Z]": "Public school funding is falling behind private schools in part due to the states failing to meet the targets set for them six years ago, spurring calls for a special deal to be struck for the Northern Territory, which has the biggest gap. In 2017, when the Turnbull government announced education reforms under the banner of Gonski 2.0, the target was for all schools to be funded to their school resourcing standard (SRS) \u2013 a needs-based model designed to provide a baseline education to students by 2023. For public schools, the states were set a 75% funding target by 2023 and the federal government a 20% target. For private schools it was the reverse, with schools receiving funding above their SRS to transition down by 2029.   Related: Private school funding increased twice as much as public schools\u2019 in decade after Gonski, data shows    The federal government has almost met its targets, but the states have not. This is due to bilateral agreements that were struck in 2018 as part of the reforms, which saw the 2023 target pushed back for some states. Only the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Western Australia have reached, or are above, the 2023 target for public school funding, according to a Senate estimates brief by the Department of Education. New South Wales recently committed to reach its target by 2025, two years earlier than under the agreement. Meanwhile, the department briefing shows Tasmania will reach its target by 2027, Victoria by 2028, and Queensland is projected to reach it by 2032. The NT has no commitment to reach the target. \u201cWe\u2019ve had now an entire generation of students who\u2019ve been to public schools that have not been fully funded to meet their needs,\u201d said Correna Haythorpe, the president of the Australian Education Union.   Interactive   The AEU is urging the federal government to increase its share of public school funding to 25% in the next schools agreement, given it has greater revenue raising power than the states. But that figure should be raised further for the NT given it is well below other states in meeting the needs of its students, the union has said. In the NT, public schools have reached just over 80% of their school resourcing standard, while private schools are at more than 97%, according to a Department of Education internal briefing. \u201cEffectively you\u2019ve got a whole cohort of students who are missing out on funding in the Northern Territory, yet [there are] huge [and] compounded needs there,\u201d said Haythorpe.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  This year the NT government met 59% of the resourcing standard for public schools, and the commonwealth contributed 21.5%, according to the department briefing. In 2018, the federal government had contributed 23.5% of the NT\u2019s SRS, the highest of any state or territory. But this has been trending downwards since the federal government decided to set the cap at 20% for all states and territories. \u201cIt\u2019s our view that there has to be a special deal for the Northern Territory,\u201d said Haythorpe. The education minister, Jason Clare, has committed to work with state and territory governments to get their public schools to 100% of their SRS, with a new National Schools Reform Agreement to be negotiated in the next year. Trevor Cobbold, an economist and the national convener of Save Our Schools, agrees that the federal government should increase its contribution to the NT \u2013 as long as the NT doesn\u2019t then reduce its own contribution. This has happened in the past. From 2013 to 2021, Cobbold said the NT government\u2019s funding to public schools dropped by more than $1,500 per student while federal government funding increased by just over $2,500.   Related: The parents fleeing Australia\u2019s public school system \u2013 and those choosing to stay    He said several other states also took the opportunity to reduce their funding in real terms after the commonwealth started to increase its recurrent school funding after the Gonski review. This included Victoria, he said, which reduced its state funding per student in real terms from 2012 until 2016. \u201cIn the next agreement the commonwealth has to ensure state and territory governments actually increase their funding,\u201d Cobbold said. Haythorpe also said state contributions are misleading because most states, under the current agreements, are able to factor in 4% of additional costs not originally deemed part of meeting the school resourcing standard, including school bus costs and in some instances early childhood learning. According to the department briefing, this was worth more than $2bn in 2023. \u201cThe real cost to the country is actually 4% more than what state and territory governments say they are doing,\u201d she said. The NSW education minister, Prue Car, said the state government had pledged alongside the federal government to get its schools to 100% of its school resourcing standard. \u201cThe truth is that public schools have been underfunded for far too long,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for the Victorian government said the state would reach its school resourcing standard as planned by 2028. The NT government was contacted for comment.", "Afternoon Update: Labor, Greens strike deal in \u2018big win for the climate\u2019; Oscar nominees get piece of Queensland; and is Twitter falling apart?

Parents would be able to add up to $1000 into their child\u2019s Kids Future Fund account every year, matched by up to $400 a child by the government annually. Government modelling suggests children would then have access to between $28,000 and $49,000 when they turn 18 that can only be used on education including HECS debts or purchasing a property.

If a child moves out of the state before turning 18, no further funds will be added but the money will still be made available to them once they come of age. There are almost 1 million children aged 10 and under in NSW and about 100,000 babies are born in the state every year. The cost of the policy covers it for the next four years. Labor has accused the government of unveiling a policy that will benefit wealthier families who will be able to invest $400 per year into the fund while it would be too much for others. Opposition treasury spokesperson, Daniel Moohkey, said it did little to fix the problems in schools and housing availability and affordability immediately. \u201cAt a time where interest rates are skyrocketing mortgages, families don\u2019t have to spare money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems as though the families that need the help the most will benefit the least from this policy because they don\u2019t have the money to put into this account.\u201d The premier made his re-election case to the party faithful at the Liverpool Catholic Club on Sunday.

Last month, X was ordered to hide the posts of the stabbing attack on bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel while he was giving a livestreamed service at the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church in the Sydney suburb of Wakeley.The eSafety commissioner sought a federal court injunction after X only made the tweets unavailable to Australian users and vowed to challenge the notice. The injunction was due to expire on Monday unless the court extended the order ahead of a final hearing, which is expected in mid-June.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Justice Geoffrey Kennett on Monday refused the application to extend the injunction. Kennett\u2019s reasons were expected to be released later on Monday. At a hearing on Friday, Kennett heard from X\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, that the wording of the order to hide the tweets was not something the company could technically comply with. At the time, Kennett said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by that information. The initial setback for the eSafety commissioner\u2019s powers came after Walker told the court on Friday that X believed the notice issued to the platform to remove the tweets was not valid. He said it was \u201cmanifestly inadequate\u201d in lacking detail in the decision by the eSafety officer, who deemed the videos to be \u201cclass 1\u201d under Australian classification law and ordered their removal.   Related: Order from eSafety to hide Sydney church stabbing video was invalid, X tells court    Walker argued the determination referred to a depiction of \u201ccrime, cruelty or violence\u201d, which was not something he said would rise to the level that would be refused classification by the classification board in Australia. He said the depiction of such an act of violence, with a camera close to see how it is being done, does not meet that bar. The barrister for the eSafety commissioner, Tim Begbie KC, told the court the decision document captured key factors the decision-maker considered and a full statement of reasons will be provided through the separate review process X launched in the administrative appeals tribunal. Walker said X had taken all reasonable steps to prevent Australians accessing the tweets, although they had still been accessible via virtual private network connections for the small subset of people who choose that method of access. He said it was a \u201creally remarkable proposition\u201d for a country to argue the only way to control what\u2019s available to end-users in Australia is \u201cto deny it to everybody on Earth\u201d. Begbie, however, argued X routinely removed content globally, but viewed it as unreasonable when ordered by the Australian government. The case returns to court on Wednesday.

[2024-05-13T04:42:54Z]": "The Albanese government will create powers to cap international student numbers at universities and in the vocational education and training sector.   Related: Why have we been excluded? The students left out of Labor\u2019s promised placement payments    The measures have been blasted by the VET sector as a \u201cchaotic\u201d policy, seeking to dictate where and what students can study and driven by \u201cshort-term populism\u201d on migration. But how would such a cap work \u2013 and what will the impact to the tertiary education sector be? How did it work previously? The number of students coming to Australia is determined by the courses offered by education providers and demand for those by students, not by Australia\u2019s skills needs or by a target or cap on the number of arrivals. Student visas are subject to rules on English language skills and minimum financial requirements, to ensure students can support themselves. After the migration review was released in December, the government tightened these requirements, including stronger English-language requirements and plans to create a new genuine student test to crack down on those looking to come to Australia primarily to work rather than study. What impact have the measures had? Although the measures have increased the rate of student visa application rejections, international student arrivals and the overall number of temporary entrants to Australia remain high. The latest home affairs data shows that the proportion of offshore student visa applications being refused has reached a record high, with as many as one in five students having their visas rejected in the year to March.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But while the flow of students is slowing, the number of international students studying in Australia still sat in excess of 700,000 as of the end of February, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. What is the proposed cap? On Saturday the government announced new legislation to allow the education minister to set a maximum number of new international student enrolments education providers can offer. A similar cap set by or on advice from the skills and training minister will operate for the VET sector. These will limit the number of international students that can be enrolled over a particular period of time. If universities want more international students, they will be required to establish additional purpose-built student accommodation for both international and domestic students. How will it be set? According to the draft international education and skills strategic framework, the government will be able to set limits on enrolments at a provider level, including within specific courses or locations. The policy won\u2019t be implemented until 1 January 2025. The caps will be set in consultation with \u201cindividual universities\u201d but for VET providers the government \u201cwill consult with the sector on a mechanism to distribute VET international student enrolments\u201d. Factors considered in setting the cap will include supply of student accommodation by the uni and the contribution of enrolments to meeting Australia\u2019s skills needs, such as health and education. The government will make schools and postgraduate research enrolments exempt from the caps, and consider excluding short courses, non-packaged short English courses, and non-award courses. Who will this most affect? The caps will probably affect VET providers who authorities believe are not offering quality courses or whose admissions undermine the integrity of the migration system, as well as universities who accept high numbers of international students.

It also noted that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of onshore international students studied in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, which was creating pressures on accommodation, transport and other infrastructure. Will there be compensation for universities? The framework says there will be \u201ctransitional arrangements that support the sector to manage this change effectively\u201d, which might suggest extra funding for those hardest hit. On Monday the finance minister said the budget \u201cwill have a focus on universities\u201d and \u201cobviously we need a strong and viable university system and VET system\u201d. What does the VET sector say? A spokesperson for the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia (Iteca) said although there were positives to the approach, the draft framework \u201csets out a policy direction driven by short-term populism over concerns about overseas migration and tenuous links between the cost of housing in urban centres\u201d. \u201c[The approach] seeks to tell independent tertiary education institutions what they should and shouldn\u2019t offer international students. For international students, the Australian government\u2019s approach is even more profound as it suggests that the government tell students what they will study and where,\u201d Iteca said. \u201cOn balance, Iteca members believe the framework is a collection of ordinary policy options lumped together with a series of bad ones. It reflects a chaotic approach to international education, where there is little relationship between tertiary education reform, the migration strategy, and a nonexistent population strategy.\u201d Iteca said the strategy would cost jobs across the sector. What do universities say? Universities Australia, the peak body for the tertiary sector, said \u201ccertainty, stability and growth\u201d were needed in future policy. It said international education contributed $48bn to the economy last year \u2013 more than half of Australia\u2019s economic growth. \u201cDecades of careful and strategic work by universities and the government has seen Australia grow to be a leading provider of international education,\u201d the CEO, Luke Sheehy, said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this work go to waste. \u201cWe will be working closely with the government to co-design the policy settings needed to give the international education sector a strong and sustainable footing from which to grow into the future.\u201d   Related: Urgent higher education reform is needed to fix a broken system and secure Australia\u2019s future | Mark Scott    The chief executive of the Group of Eight, Vicki Thomson, said the body strongly supported measures to improve quality and integrity in the international education sector although \u201cany mix of policy settings must be considered, and nuanced\u201d. The Go8 universities educate one in three of Australia\u2019s international students and are heavily reliant on their revenue \u2013 at the University of Sydney, international students account for more than 40% of revenue.

We are in the planning stages of increasing youth detention centre infrastructure in Queensland, working in partnership with the Department of State Development, Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning, and in consultation with key government agencies,\u201d Linard said. \u201cAlternate models of detention are being investigated, including smaller facilities that incorporate therapeutic approaches.\u201d The minister also said \u201cthere must be consequences\u201d for \u201cserious repeat offenders\u201d. Crisafulli said the state government\u2019s failure to \u201cplan\u201d and \u201clisten\u201d had resulted in all three of the state\u2019s youth detention facilities reaching full capacity. \u201cNo one can suggest that locking up kids for several weeks without any form of rehabilitation assists in the long term.

The cuts reverse some of the Morrison government\u2019s most controversial spending, from pre-2019 election commitments including the urban congestion fund, the Hells Gate Dam and regional funds established by the Coalition\u2019s last budget in March.

This includes a cut of $769m from the urban congestion fund, including a $160m saving from the controversial commuter car park fund, which the auditor general found was used to fund Coalition election commitments. If you\u2019re hoping to park and ride at MacArthur or East Hills on the T8 line, or Hurstville in New South Wales; or Bentleigh, Ferntree Gully or Hampton in Victoria then there is bad news: the budget axes the commuter car parks promised for these suburbs.

The government has also \u201creprofiled\u201d the funding of existing projects, meaning the projects will still be built but over a longer timeframe, with $6.5bn of infrastructure spending pushed out of the forward estimates (the next four years) into the medium term. The budget papers explain this was done \u201cto better align investment with construction market conditions\u201d. Although this measure is a net $4.7bn saving, the government is also spending in the infrastructure portfolio, including:  $2.6bn for Victoria, including $2.2bn for the Suburban Rail Loop East $2.1bn for Queensland, including $866m for the Bruce Highway $1.4bn for NSW, including $500m for the early planning for Sydney-to-Newcastle rail  Regions The budget shows a $1.4bn saving for \u201cresponsible investment to grow our regions\u201d.

The deal secured the passage of the NRF bill through the lower house on Thursday and gives Labor a likely pathway to pass it in the Senate with the support of the Greens and crossbench in late March. The breakthrough on the NRF could also help pave the way for a deal on the safeguards bill, with Greens leader Adam Bandt suggesting parliament had accepted fossil fuels must be treated differently, a principle which could also be applied through a limit on their use of carbon credits. The NRF bill establishes an off-budget $15bn investment fund to support manufacturing and emerging industries. The bill was opposed by the Coalition, which has labelled it a slush fund and argued that large-scale investment might be inflationary, forcing Labor to deal with the Greens. The passage in the NRF bill in the lower house comes as Labor and Greens are still deadlocked on the safeguard mechanism bill requiring big emitters to reduce emissions intensity by 4.9% a year, with the Greens calling for a ban on new coal and gas projects and Labor insisting it has a mandate to reject a condition it says would reduce supply of gas as a transition fuel.

Bandt told reporters in Canberra it\u2019s \u201cclear that parliament is willing to acknowledge coal and gas are making the climate crisis worse\u201d, arguing they must be \u201ctreated differently to the rest of Australian industry\u201d. Bandt said the Greens were concerned that under the safeguards mechanism bill fossil fuel projects could buy unlimited carbon credits, hinting that limiting their use of credits could be a fall-back position if Labor continues to reject the Greens\u2019 \u201cprincipal position\u201d to ban new coal and gas projects. Bandt said that other options proposed by the Climate Council and Australian Conservation Foundation were \u201con the table\u201d, including a pause on new coal and gas, an option already rejected by climate minister Chris Bowen. Allman-Payne said the Coalition \u201ctried to use public money to fund coal and gas through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and they were unable to do so because of the guardrails that the Greens and Labor put in place\u201d. \u201cWe have the same assurance that the NRF won\u2019t be used to fund the climate crisis.\u201d To pass the NRF bill Labor will still require the votes of senator Lidia Thorpe, who has committed to vote with the Greens on climate; and independent senator David Pocock, who is meeting the government to discuss the bill next week; or the Jacqui Lambie Network. JLN senator, Tammy Tyrrell, responded furiously to the deal, arguing it breached a commitment by Anthony Albanese in May 2022 to support native forest harvesting. \u201cGiving in to the Greens\u2019 demands is a smack in the face to Tasmanians,\u201d Tyrrell said. Earlier, the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, told the lower house it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that Labor had struck the deal, particularly because \u201cgas has played a key role in the transition to renewable energy\u201d. In a statement Ley said that \u201cevery expert is calling on the prime minister to unlock more supply of gas\u201d but the \u201cawful deal\u201d with the Greens would make this harder.

They urge governments to also take steps to restore parents\u2019 trust in the public system, and stem the growing concentration of disadvantage. \u201cOur kids can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d says the Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to pretend that fairness is central to our national identity when our public school system is on the brink of collapse and elite private schools are swimming in cash.\u201d The federal government is working on a review of the education system before setting a new national schools reform agreement next year, and has committed to get every school to 100% of its Schooling Resource Standard (SRS), the fair funding level proposed under the Gonski reforms. The education minister, Jason Clare, says there is a crucial gap that needs to be filled. \u201cBy the end of this decade all nongovernment schools will come down to 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard. But apart from in the ACT, no government school will be.\u201d    The former New South Wales state education minister Adrian Piccoli says the onus is on the federal government to increase its contribution to public schools from the current 20% because it has greater taxation powers than the states.  \u201cThat\u2019s why you get this disproportional increase because the commonwealth are increasing their funding, but they fund nongovernment schools more than they fund government schools, so of course the nongovernment funding goes up more than the government schools funding goes up.\u201d He says the federal government should fund public schools at the same proportion it funds private schools. \u201c[It] could be 50/50 or that the commonwealth funds 80% of all students,\u201d he says.

But Allman-Payne says lifting the commonwealth contribution to 25% is not enough: \u201cAnother 5% won\u2019t close the gap in the Northern Territory, where public schools are underfunded by more than 20%. Or in Queensland, where they\u2019re being shortchanged by over 10%.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The former prime minister Malcom Turnbull says the reason his government set the federal contribution at 20% \u2013 which was an increase from 17% \u2013 was to hold the states to contributing at least 75%. \u201cOtherwise you get a zero sum game where the commonwealth puts in more and the state just takes money out the back end,\u201d he says. Boosting confidence As the example of Shepparton shows, restoring parents\u2019 confidence in public education requires more than just a funding increase. O\u2019Brien says the facilities in the amalgamated school are a big improvement on what was available to students previously. \u201cStudents love going into these spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s shown them that it\u2019s possible for them to get the best, regardless of their background, demographics.\u201d Greater Shepparton secondary college was built to hold about 3,000 students. But last year only 2,083 were enrolled, a drop from 2,269 students in 2020, and 562 fewer than the combined figure for the final year when the four pre-existing public schools were open in 2018.  More affluent parents have continued to turn to or remain in the independent and Catholic schools in Shepparton. MySchools data shows their students perform above Greater Shepparton secondary college on Naplan.   Interactive   Michael Sciffer, president of the Armidale Teachers Association, says restoring trust in public education needs to start with a narrative shift from the top.  \u201cIn my view the conservative side of politics are part of the problem in creating this negative view of public schools,\u201d he says. \u201cGovernments need to talk about the fact that public schools provide equal opportunities for kids to reach their potential in life.\u201d Enrolling in diversity Part of the problem is simply one of perception about standards in public schools. The OECD\u2019s Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) studies show the results of both Australia\u2019s government and nongovernment schools fell between 2009 and 2018, but public schools had the smaller drop. It was also the only sector to not have a significant drop in reading and literacy, according to Pisa.    If a school has a good reputation, they\u2019re going to get more students and more enrolments and better educational results  Dr Tracy Woodroffe     Sciffer says attracting more students from affluent backgrounds back to the public system is a win-win. The Pisa data underlines that on average, students from a low socioeconomic background perform better in schools that also have students from a high socioeconomic background. And students from a high socioeconomic background tend to perform just as well at a public school as they do at a private school. Sciffer says governments could consider adjusting Atar ranks according to a school\u2019s socio-education disadvantage. Similar moves in Texas and California have helped draw middle-class families back to neighbourhood public schools, he says. Dr Tracy Woodroffe, a Warumungu Luritja woman and an education expert at Charles Darwin University, says in relation to Indigenous students, governments need to consult more with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents, and also calls for a concerted effort to train more Indigenous teachers \u2013 currently only 2% of the workforce.    \u201cWe get the annual Naplan report that shows that Indigenous students [are] performing below their non-Indigenous peers, and that\u2019s even more the case for remote Indigenous students,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe people don\u2019t know enough about the diversity of Indigenous peoples across Australia, and programs that are implemented are often one size fits all.\u201d She says meeting the specific needs of a community would benefit the broader community. \u201cIf a school has a good reputation, they\u2019re going to get more students and more enrolments and better educational results. So really, that cross-cultural communication and learning benefits all our kids.\u201d   Related: Private school funding increased twice as much as public schools\u2019 in decade after Gonski, data shows    Tom Greenwell, the author of Waiting for Gonski: How Australia Failed its Schools, says ultimately all schools should be free to reduce the concentration of disadvantage in certain schools and boost education outcomes.

Meanwhile, the federal government\u2019s $22m scheme designed to provide Covid insurance for live events was redundant before it had a chance to kick in and there appears to be nothing in the pipeline to replace it over the summer. More than a dozen music festivals have been cancelled this year due to heavy rain and storms brought on by La Ni\u00f1a weather patterns, including Strawberry Fields in the Riverina, The Grass is Greener in Canberra and Geelong, Bendigo\u2019s Almost Summer and both This That festivals in New South Wales and Queensland.

But the fund only applied to events affected by mandatory isolation requirements \u2013 so when the national cabinet agreed in early October to end isolation requirements, the insurance scheme was rendered irrelevant.

Along with threats of bad weather and an ongoing pandemic, the Australian Festival Association (AFA) said the industry faced the start of 2023 with a 30% rise in supplier costs, inconsistent advanced ticket sales compared with pre-Covid patterns and a hike in insurance premiums by as much as 300%. \u201cThe festivals that we know and love may not survive if they don\u2019t have a successful first season back after Covid,\u201d the association\u2019s managing director, Mitch Wilson, told the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019ve struggled to stay alive.\u201d Despite being axed in early October, the $22m insurance fund was still counted as money spent to support the arts in the 2022 federal budget delivered on 25 October, some two weeks after the scheme had been abandoned. Neither the arts minister, Tony Burke, nor his department would respond to the Guardian\u2019s queries about why funding for a defunct support scheme was included in the 2022 budget. A spokesperson from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications and the Arts said in a statement that Labor had made good an election promise to provide cover for live performance adversely affected by Covid. \u201cIn line with national cabinet\u2019s decision to end mandatory Covid-19 isolation periods from 14 October, industry can now proceed with events such as plays, concerts and festivals with confidence and without the need to access pandemic-related coverage from the commonwealth,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe government is carefully considering future funding decisions ahead of the May 2023 federal budget, including any reallocation of unexpended funds.\u201d Calls grow to flood-proof outdoor festivals An early December poll of 1,107 young people in five marginal NSW electorates conducted by the United Workers Union found that more than 40% of voters aged 18-24 wanted the NSW government to offer public funding to help flood-proof outdoor music events. Just over 20% believed it was not a government responsibility. Union director Karma Lord said the live music industry had been \u201csmashed\u201d by years of repressive lockout laws, hostile planning regulations and Covid. \u201cOutdoor music festivals are a rite of passage for young people, but in 2022 we saw just how vulnerable they are to extreme weather events like floods,\u201d she said.

On Tuesday, the Palaszczuk government committed $262.5m to protecting more land for nature. That included $250m for land acquisition and capital works, a figure the World Wide Fund for Nature described as the largest single investment in national parks acquisition in the state\u2019s history. Dr Stuart Blanch, a conservation scientist at WWF Australia, said the money was \u201ca massive step in the right direction\u201d towards addressing the fact that a state home to \u201csuch amazing wildlife and ecosystems\u201d had the least developed network of protected areas in Australia. \u201cThe 2020 national assessment of protected areas found only 8.71% of Queensland is within protected or conserved areas,\u201d Blanch said. \u201cThis figure pales in comparison to [figures of] 42.3% in Tasmania, 24.9% in the Northern Territory and 23.3% in Western Australia.\u201d   Related: Queensland state budget increases taxes on miners, big business to fund new hospitals and mental health services    The Queensland government has a protected area target of 17%. But the director of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said until this point there simply had not been the money to achieve that target. \u201cThe big problem has been that we haven\u2019t had enough money to buy land as suitable places that could be protected come on to the market,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we do.\u201d Though dominated by big-ticket spending in response to the pandemic and planning for the 2032 Brisbane Games, Copeman said the funding for national parks would provide this budget\u2019s longest-standing legacy. \u201cWhen Covid and the Olympics are trivia questions, the areas protected by this funding will be visited by our grandkids,\u201d he said. Copeman said it was critical that money be spent on buying land that would allow species to adapt to a changing climate. \u201cIf we want to avoid mass extinction, we need to protect habitat that acts as climate refugia,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could act as the lifeboats for threatened species that keeps them alive as the temperature warms.\u201d Just how effectively that money is used, however, would be determined over the course of a decade or more, with land to be bought as it hits the market. A far easier assessment to make, according to the Australian Conservation Foundation\u2019s Jason Lyddieth, was the budget\u2019s commitment to confronting the climate crisis. \u201cThere is nothing for climate in this budget,\u201d the Brisbane-based climate and energy campaigner said. \u201cConsidering that we\u2019ve had devastating floods in the last six months, another coral bleaching event \u2013 the first time that\u2019s ever happened in a La Ni\u00f1a year \u2013 and that we are seeing the climate starting to impact Queensland really badly, the fact that there is no spending on climate change is outrageous.\u201d Lyddieth said the Palaszczuk government had gone to three elections promising climate action but had still \u201cnot delivered\u201d \u2013 instead expanding the coal and gas industry. \u201cThey\u2019re walking both sides of the fence, and that is going to be disastrous for us,\u201d Lyddieth said.

In most cases retirees\u2019 investment earnings are not taxed on accounts with a balance of less than $1.7m. On accounts with a balance above $1.7m, investment earnings are taxed at just 15%, well below the top marginal tax rate of 45%.

Initially touted as costing $700m, the likely bill had almost tripled to about $2bn by March this year, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office. That sum excluded the offset costs for the environment damage of flooding as much as 6,000 hectares of the Greater Blue Mountains world heritage area that the government put at $1.34bn as a minimum. Coalition governments under three premiers had backed it as \u201cthe most effective infrastructure option to reduce the regional flood risk\u201d for the 140,000 people living on the flood plain. No funding, though, was ever allocated to the wall-raising and no business case was ever made, the current government said. Had the project been approved, planning and construction would have take seven to eight years. The water minister, Rose Jackson, said the cancelling of the planning application was \u201cthe final step\u201d of meeting Labor\u2019s pre-election commitment to stop the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a box-ticking exercise but it is a box that needed to be ticked,\u201d she said. \u201cWaterNSW needed to formally say \u2018we are not proceeding with that project\u2019.\u201d Jackson said the government was examining other options. One is to double the size of Sydney\u2019s desalination plant to meet 30% of the city\u2019s water needs, potentially lowering the reservoir\u2019s maximum water level to give it so-called airspace to absorb more inflows before the dam spills downstream. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that whilst we\u2019re so reliant on it for drinking water,\u201d she said, noting the dam supplies about 85% of the city\u2019s water. The government had also made it clear \u201cwe do not want more development on the flood plain\u201d, Jackson said. So-called in-fill development by raising the density of housing along transport corridors was instead the priority. Harry Burkitt, one of the leaders of the Give a Dam campaign that had opposed the wall-raising, said it required unstinting efforts of \u201cobsessive individuals\u201d willing to endure a \u201cslow, tedious, and paralysing\u201d effort. \u201cThere have been a handful of such people,\u201d Burkitt said. \u201cTheir determination and devotion has today paid off.\u201d Rob Pallin, who helped fund the campaign through the Paddy Pallin Foundation he set up in his father\u2019s name, called the project\u2019s cancellation \u201ca great win for the environment\u201d.

Delivering the first Labor budget in almost a decade on Tuesday, the treasurer also flagged the need for tax reform in this term of government to be able to put the budget on a more sustainable footing as spending pressures mount and government debt and deficits worsen across the forward estimates.   Related: This is a budget of no surprises \u2013 designed to be sober, to build trust in the hope of better things to come | Katharine Murphy    Chalmers also signalled more government intervention in the energy sector, saying he is \u201cworried\u201d about gas and electricity price rises of up to 30% next year. The budget contains few new commitments beyond those promised before the election, with a housing policy that aims to boost supply by a million homes by 2030 the headline announcement, backed by $350m in new funding. It also delivers on Labor\u2019s key election promises, allocating $7.5bn for childcare reforms, aged care, cheaper medicines and expanding paid parental leave.   Interactive   Chalmers said with inflation tipped to be higher and more persistent than previously forecast, the government had put a premium on spending restraint to ensure it did not add to pressures already faced by households. \u201cRestraint is the name of the game in this budget, restraint is what defines this budget, and what differentiates it from March and from recent budgets under our predecessors,\u201d he said. Amid a \u201chighly uncertain\u201d global economic outlook that poses the risk of a further downturn in Australia, the treasurer said he had resisted calls for cash handouts to help people deal with cost-of-living concerns, saying he did not want to make the problem worse.

While confining its cost-of-living measures mostly to those promised before the election \u2013 with the most expensive being the government\u2019s childcare reforms \u2013 Chalmers said the government was looking to do more to combat rising energy prices, with the budget forecasting retail electricity price rises of 20% this year and 30% in 2023-24. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that we\u2019re not worried about these electricity price forecasts,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cI think any responsible government facing these kinds of price hikes for electricity and for gas needs to consider a broader suite of regulatory interventions than they might have considered in years gone by.\u201d In an attempt to limit the budget\u2019s impact on inflation, the government has returned 99% of the increase in tax revenues to the budget over the next two years and offset most of its policy decisions in that timeframe. In contrast, Chalmers said, the seven budgets between the mid-year budget update in 2013-14 and the March budget had returned an average of 40%. The budget\u2019s key new measure is an affordable housing accord signed with industry and the states, with an \u201caspirational target\u201d to build 1m new homes in five years from 2024 that would target areas of low vacancy and high rents. Details are yet to be fleshed out with institutional investors, with work to be pursued by a newly formed \u201cround table\u201d of representatives from the superannuation and banking sector. Savings of $22bn have been found across the forward estimates, with the largest of these \u2013 $6.5bn \u2013 coming from \u201creprofiling\u201d of infrastructure spending promised by the former government. The government\u2019s budget repair task has also been boosted by a revenue boom coming from soaring commodity prices and a strong labour market, which has delivered a $41.1bn improvement to the budget bottom line in 2022-23, and a $12.5bn improvement next year. Cumulative deficits over the forward estimates now total $181bn, compared with the $224.7bn forecast before the election. But from 2024-25 as commodity prices decline, the deficits are worse than previously forecast, peaking at 2% of GDP in 2024-25 to be $51.3bn, and at $49.6bn in 2025-26. This is $11bn worse than forecast in March.   Related: Six graphs that explain the 2022 federal budget: rosy views mugged by reality | Greg Jericho    Chalmers said the government had demonstrated it was prepared to take \u201cdifficult decisions in difficult times\u201d but there remained a bigger job ahead to put the budget on a more sustainable footing given the worsening outlook. He said the task could not wait until after the next election: \u201cI don\u2019t think that that work can wait for another three or four budgets, it has been neglected for too long, and so we do hope to lead a conversation this term about how we get this budget on a more sustainable footing.\u201d The spending pressures include interest payments on government debt which are growing at 14.4% annually, followed by a 13.8% annual increase on national disability insurance scheme spending, and 6.5% for hospital spending. Despite the government ruling out tweaks to the stage-three tax cuts in this budget, Chalmers said he believed the \u201cnational conversation\u201d about how to fund the services that Australians expected needed to canvass the possibility of changes to the tax system. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done in this budget is we\u2019ve built the foundation of a more sustainable budget but there\u2019s more work to do, and that will involve ongoing spending restraint, it will involve trimming spending where we can, targeting investments, and also tax reform,\u201d he said. The government\u2019s post-election budget paints a grim picture of the economic outlook, with warnings there could be a sharper slowdown in domestic activity that could place further pressures on households. Growth has already been downgraded by one percentage point to 1.5% next year, and down 0.25% this year to 3.25%. Globally, key risks include recession across major advanced economies, a sharper-than-expected downturn in China, a sudden tightening in financial markets and further energy price shocks stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These risks could drive inflation even higher than the 5.75% forecast for 2022-23, with inflation set to peak at 7.75% in the December quarter this year.   Related: Jim Chalmers\u2019 first budget comes amid a darkening economic outlook. Here\u2019s what could go wrong    The budget papers also point to the uncertainty linked to the floods, future interest rate rises and household responses to inflation as key risks to economic activity. \u201cHigher-than-expected inflation may further constrain consumer spending by lowering real incomes, while a potentially weaker economic outlook could see households exhibit precautionary savings behaviour that further weighs on consumption,\u201d they say. They also say low-income households are expected to be more heavily affected by the high-inflation environment, as essentials such as housing costs and energy make up a larger share of their household expenses. Wages are not expected to outpace inflation until 2023-24, when they are forecast to grow 3.75% compared with the consumer price index of 3.5%, at the same time as unemployment jumps from 3.75% to 4.5%. The opposition\u2019s treasury spokesman, Angus Taylor, accused the government of breaking an election promise to reduce power bills by $275, and said the budget would not help ease cost of living concerns. \u201cThe real test \u2026 was whether Labor was going to deal with the cost of living pressures Australians are facing,\u201d Taylor told the ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that if you are a typical Australian household, you are not going to see any improvement between now and Christmas.\u201d", "ABC given $83.7m to reverse Coalition\u2019s funding cuts but little help for arts in 2022 budget [2022-10-25T08:46:56Z]": "The Australian Broadcasting Corporation will receive an additional $83.7m over four years to restore funding it lost as a result of the former Coalition government\u2019s freeze on annual funding increases.

At least $500m a year would be spent on the housing sector \u2013 with Albanese saying that over the first five years the fund would build 20,000 social housing properties, with 4,000 of those to be allocated for women and children fleeing domestic violence, and for older women on low incomes at risk of homelessness. \nRead our explainer on the legislation, here. \nHow has it been received? \n \n  Related: No pets allowed: NSW pushed to act on \u2018urgent\u2019 need to make rentals more animal-friendly   \n \nThere have been a few major criticisms. For one, the fund wouldn\u2019t start until 2024, with the first builds not scheduled until 2025. The government believes the fund would create 30,000 homes in the first five years, but the Greens say this will not go far enough to solve the problem, and that the number needed would be closer to 700,000. \nWhat do the Greens want? \nThe Greens have scaled back their demands which at one stage included a $5bn direct spend on housing every year and an additional $1.6bn a year to incentivise the states. The party also wanted a rent freeze for 2.5 years and limited increases there after. \nEarlier this month, the Greens announced it would settle for a $2.5bn annual spend on housing and a year of rent freezes. \nHas the government offered to compromise? \nThe government has made the $500m spend a \u201cfloor not a ceiling\u201d, meaning it would be the minimum spent each year over the five-year investment. \nAlbanese and housing minister Julie Collins have repeatedly said the Haff is just one piece in their housing policy pie and there would be more initiatives, including direct action with the states, to complement it. \nCollins says $575m would be allocated from the national housing infrastructure facility for social and affordable homes, as would $350m through the national housing accord for 10,000 new affordable rental homes. \nOther concessions included indexation of payouts from the Housing Australia Future Fund from 2029; a review to be completed by December 2026; energy efficiency standards in new homes; and $200m from the fund for the repair, maintenance and improvement of housing in remote Indigenous communities. \nWhat is happening with rents? \nThe Albanese government has put renters\u2019 rights on the national cabinet agenda but has continued to reject the Greens\u2019 claims it could force a national rental freeze. \nThe Greens have cited the energy market intervention as proof it could work, with housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather saying it would be a \u201cbrave\u201d state or territory government which turned down funds to make housing cheaper. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nBut Albanese told parliament last week each of the states and territories were in agreement and had advice a rental freeze \u201cwould not work\u201d.  \nThe Albanese government says the issue is housing supply and that will be the priority . \nSo what about supply? \nThat\u2019s where the $2bn social housing \u201cbooster\u201d payment comes in.

Both have continued to publicly criticise the other for not doing enough to shift the housing crisis. \nThe Greens will continue to push for action for renters, with a freeze on rents its main aim.

Even after Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund, ACBF-Youpla, was kicked off the government system, it continued to reap the benefits. In 2017 alone, the company pocketed more than $3.4m from cancelled policies, new data shows.

The current federal government has a responsibility to right that historical wrong and make amends to those who suffered and are still suffering today.\u201d The collapse of ACBF-Youpla left thousands of mostly low-income Aboriginal people, some of them elderly and in palliative care, without any means of paying for a funeral. As liquidators sift through the remaining assets, it is unclear if those affected \u2013 estimated to be about 30,000 Aboriginal people \u2013 will ever receive a refund. People had paid between $3,000 and $30,000 into the fund during its time of operation from 1992 to 2022. Corporate regulator Asic is seeking a record $7.5m penalty against the insurer for its \u201cdeliberate and knowing conduct of preying on vulnerable Aboriginal people\u201d. Asic alleges the company engaged in deceptive and misleading conduct between 2015 and 2018. In September, the federal government set up an interim relief scheme amid reports that people were forced to leave their loved ones in the morgue while they raised money for funerals. The scheme is open until 30 November 2023. Advocates argue governments were aware of concerns about ACBF-Youpla for decades. In October 2007, Centrelink investigated ACBF, which was also found by Asic to have breached the anti-hawking provisions of the Corporations act by selling insurance policies door-to-door. But the company was allowed to remain on the Centrepay system until the Turnbull government finally kicked it off in 2017. ACBF-Youpla cancelled policies if a holder missed more than two successive payments. New data from the liquidator shows there was a 300% increase in such cancellations when ACBF-Youpla was removed from Centrepay. Centrepay was critical to ACBF-Youpla\u2019s exploitative business model, Bettina Cooper of Save Sorry Business told Guardian Australia. \u201cBecause ACBF was the only insurance fund ever allowed on Centrepay, it gave them the tick of approval.

Unlike other guests, they weren\u2019t travelling; the motel was emergency accommodation. The family had become homeless only days before. \nThe Orlandos had been evicted from their affordable housing property, one of 32,000 nationally that had been leased to renters under the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS). \nAfter spending years in the shelter of below-market rents, they and other NRAS tenants are being thrust into a private rental market vastly more expensive and competitive than when they left it, coupled with a state-based social housing system that is on the verge of collapsing under the weight of need. \nIt\u2019s the pointy end of a national housing crisis that has yet to be adequately addressed. \n \n  Related: \u2018I am panicking\u2019: the vulnerable renters at risk as housing subsidy expires  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a hellride,\u201d Richard Orlando says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to call it.\u201d \nWhile the debate in federal parliament over the past weeks has centred on the efficiency of the Labor government\u2019s proposed long-term housing solutions, NRAS renters say that, with the expiry of the program, their biggest concern is immediate support. \n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing, basically,\u201d Susanne Orlando says. \u201cNothing to follow up NRAS and everyone wants to pass the parcel to everybody else.\u201d \nAdvocates say this is a problem that has been years in the making \u2013 and was entirely foreseeable. \nEnd of NRAS stokes tenants\u2019 fear \nThe Orlandos first moved to the Gold Coast to be closer to an elderly relative. Richard had been a painter by trade but had to stop working after developing a cavernoma in his brain, which causes brain bleeds and extreme seizures. After years stuck on jobseeker, he was finally granted the disability pension in 2020. \nRichard and Susanne have been separated for over a decade but chose to share a house as single adults a few years ago, partly because Susanne understood Richard\u2019s disability, and so Richard could be close to their son, Wayde. Wayde is autistic, and Susanne receives a carer\u2019s pension to look after him. Staying in the area where they have been living is important to the family, as Wayde requires a school that has the right environment for his learning needs, while Richard needs to be close to his medical support system. \nThe household has no other assets or income other than Centrelink. They were on the waitlist for social housing in Queensland some years ago but were bumped off it when they accepted the NRAS lease. \n \n  \n  How do you explain to a six-year-old that you might not have a house? \n   Leandra Arrowsmith \n   \n  \n \nNRAS was a national Rudd-era program that paid property owners a subsidy in exchange for them keeping rents on new homes on a cheaper rate for a decade. It was criticised for being inefficient, axed by the Abbott government in 2014, and homes have been progressively phased off the scheme since, with the last ones due to expire in 2026. \nAbout half the properties were owned by private investors, many of whom are choosing to sell once their subsidy expires \u2013 as the Orlandos\u2019 landlords did, triggering their eviction last year. \nOthers are raising rents to market rate, stoking tenants\u2019 fears. \nBill Turner, who rents a one-bedroom NRAS unit in Mandurah, Western Australia, says he was told his rent would increase from $188 a week to the market rate of $350 in October. \nTurner retired last year after Covid made his small entertainment business unviable. He receives the aged pension, but has had to start working again in order to make extra income, which will soon be going towards his rent. \n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about that. Certainly not,\u201d Turner says. \u201cThe reality is striking home now. I\u2019m 73 and there\u2019s limited income there. I didn\u2019t come through my working life with a great deal of money.\u201d \n \n  Related: Australian renters face surging costs after end of national affordability scheme  \n \nTurner worries what will happen when he is forced to try to find low-cost accommodation on the private rental market, particularly as he gets older. He is also worried about some of his neighbours, also in NRAS properties, and who cannot work. \n \n Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads \n \nLeandra Arrowsmith, 39, was paying $272 a week for the house she lives in with her young twins in Brisbane. Her lease rose to $420 a week and she has only been able to maintain it after receiving a six-month study assistance grant from a charity that pays for the rent that her single parenting payment doesn\u2019t cover. \n\u201cIt has been extremely stressful, and even though I\u2019m set for now, I know that this problem is going to come back again in October when the lease runs out,\u201d Arrowsmith says. \n\u201cHow do you explain to a six-year-old that you might not have a house?\u201d \nHousing agency \u2018would welcome\u2019 another subsidy \nThe Orlandos have found the private rental market impossible. Not only are private rentals too expensive for them (median Gold Coast rents have increased by 33% in the past five years), they have the added complication of their final rental ledger showing them as in arrears. That black mark means all their private rental applications have been rejected. \nThe Orlandos say the ledger is incorrect; that their bank statements show they ought to be hundreds of dollars in credit. They have tried to address the issue with their former estate agency, Horizon Housing Realty, a subsidiary of Community Housing Ltd, but it has not yet been resolved. \n \n  Related: \u2018Now you\u2019re evicting them?\u2019: Victorians in \u2018life-changing\u2019 housing scheme face homelessness again  \n \nThe executive director of Horizon, Gavin Potter, said the company\u2019s records showed the ledger to be correct and that Horizon had written a positive rental reference for the family, but said he would welcome the opportunity to work through the issue with the family again to resolve any discrepancies. \nAbout 30% of all NRAS properties were in Queensland, and Horizon managed hundreds of them. Potter said the agency had appealed to the Queensland government for a reduced subsidy program to help maintain NRAS tenancies post-expiry. \n\u201cWe are doing our utmost best but are limited as these are not our properties and there is no current funding mechanism for exiting NRAS tenants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will continue to advocate and support to the best of our ability but would welcome a subsidy to assist.\u201d \nQueensland\u2019s \u2018unusual\u2019 eligibility criteria \nThe Orlandos\u2019 difficulties have been exacerbated by the tight eligibility criteria for Queensland social housing. Despite having no assets or income other than Centrelink payments, and with two disabled household members, the Orlandos have been told they earn \u201ctoo much\u201d to be eligible. \nThe maximum income threshold for social housing in Queensland is vastly lower than other states and territories, with maximum income for two single adults and a child sitting at $877 a week. In Victoria, the closest equivalent classification is for two adults and a dependent child, for which the maximum weekly income threshold is $2,284 a week \u2013 more than $1,400 higher. \n \n  \n  The housing crisis has been a decade in the making. \n   Housing advocate Emma Greenhalgh \n   \n  \n \nThere are already more than 27,000 households on the Queensland waitlist. A recent report for Queensland Council of Social Services estimated the unmet need at more than 100,000 households. Changes to social housing eligibility criteria in 2019 resulted in restrictions that were \u201cunusual by Australian standards\u201d, the report said, effectively excluding all but the most extreme-needs households. \nThe chief executive of Gold Coast community disability support service CASSI, Sharon Wrigley, said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that the Orlandos had been rejected from the social housing register. \n\u201cThis is a sign of a significant, systemic issue across our state,\u201d Wrigley said. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason why people who are on a pension, who meet the wellbeing criteria for accessing social housing, should be discriminated against. Because they have a child with them, their need is dire.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe Queensland minister for communities and housing, Leeane Enoch, did not directly answer questions from Guardian Australia about why social housing income thresholds were significantly lower than much of the rest of the country to the extent where a household living solely on Centrelink payments could be excluded. \n\u201cSocial housing is a limited resource and is provided to customers in greatest need,\u201d Enoch said. \u201cPeople on low incomes, such as an income payment from Services Australia, are generally eligible for social housing. \n\u201cThe department uses eligibility settings, including income eligibility limits, to ensure reasonable and fair access to housing assistance and to tailor products and services to customer needs.\u201d \n \n  Related: \u2018Holding cell\u2019: Melbourne family with disabled son stuck in \u2018transitional\u2019 housing for a decade  \n \nThe Greens MP for South Brisbane, Amy MacMahon, says by restricting social housing eligibility, the Queensland Labor government had been \u201cmasking the scale of the housing crisis\u201d. \nShe is calling on the state government to follow their recent commitment to buy 335 NRAS homes by buying every NRAS home that would otherwise go to the private market, and build more public housing. \nProposed policies not enough for now \nGoing into the 2022 election, the federal Labor party proposed measures to address the housing crisis, including development of a housing and homelessness plan and an investment fund to generate capital for housing construction. \nThe fund is now locked up in Senate negotiations. Much of Labor\u2019s policy platform is focused on construction, an industry that has been plagued by delays and constraints, which are forecast to continue. And the government has refused so far to commit to raising commonwealth rent assistance or income support payments beyond inflation. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nThe chief executive of housing advocacy organisation National Shelter, Emma Greenhalgh, says the federal and state governments could have acted sooner to provide a safety net after NRAS. \n\u201cThe housing crisis didn\u2019t happen in one year, this has been a decade in the making,\u201d she says. \nNational Shelter has called on the federal government to provide a $2bn rapid response housing fund in the next budget that would allow housing providers to increase affordable housing quickly, for example, through spot buying or refurbishment and renovation. \nThe federal minister for housing, Julie Collins, did not address this specific proposal, but in a statement said up to $575m in funding was already available through the national housing infrastructure facility. \nCollins said the proposals before the Senate represented \u201ca once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a secure, ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable housing over the long term\u201d. \nThis is of little comfort to the Orlandos. At the time of writing, it was unclear where they would spend the Easter holidays. On the Wednesday afternoon before the long weekend, they were frantically packing again.

The flyers, which listed the name of an interstate white supremacist group, contained a racial slur and the images of two local girls accused of a serious assault and depravation of liberty. The identities of three girls charged in relation to the 11 March incident \u2013 aged 12, 13 and 14 \u2013 are suppressed under Queensland law, but their names and photographs appear in hundreds of live social media posts on multiple platforms, including calls for people to \u201cbash\u201d them or take retribution.   Related: Queensland house burned down in suspected vigilante attack was subject of social media posts calling for violence    Guardian Australia revealed last month that the location of the Tewantin home of two of the accused girls had been identified in dozens of social media posts calling for violence against them.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The property, owned by the Queensland Department of Housing, was destroyed in a suspected arson attack last month. Police have said there were prior incidents of vandalism and attempted arson at the address. It is unclear whether police believe there is a direct link between the distribution of racist flyers and the arson attack. In a statement, police said were investigating possible links between the assault accusations against the girls, the flyers, and the house fire. \u201cInvestigations indicate an unknown group of people distributed offensive and harassing materials via mail in the Tewantin area in the lead-up to the arson of the house,\u201d police said. \u201cInvestigators believe there may be a link between the three incidents. \u201cAnyone with information regarding the arson or distribution of hate mail is asked to contact police.\u201d Police said the three men may be able to assist with their inquiries. The footage shows the three men in the Tewantin neighbourhood. One man places a flyer in a letter box and two others are shown walking through the streets. Guardian Australia has viewed posts \u2013 which remain online on multiple social media platforms \u2013 identifying the girls accused of the attack, and listing their addresses, physical description, ethnicity and phone numbers. Information posted also includes the names of the girls\u2019 family members, their phone numbers, addresses and workplace information. One post included a map showing the location of the property, a photograph of the front of the house, names one of the girls and says: \u201cSee ya soon.\u201d Hundreds of posts naming the girls remain online. There have been increasing concerns about vigilantism in Queensland, particularly amid a heightened environment relating to youth crime. Children living in a Queensland residential care home were the subject of death threats on social media earlier this year \u2013 including calls for neighbours to \u201cstorm the house\u201d and \u201chang whoever is inside\u201d \u2013 after media reports incorrectly claimed the premises was a halfway house for young criminals. Police also expressed concerns about the potential for vigilantism at a crime forum in Toowoomba in February, while the state\u2019s human rights commissioner, Scott McDougall, has spoken of \u201cthe need for police to closely monitor vigilante activity\u201d.", "Crossbenchers urge Labor to have \u2018courage\u2019 on changes to resources tax and stage-three tax cuts [2023-10-27T03:13:40Z]": "Influential crossbench parliamentarians have called on Labor to toughen up the petroleum resource rent tax and redistribute stage-three tax cuts to raise revenue to alleviate the cost of living. The independent senator David Pocock and MPs Monique Ryan and Dai Le have called for more \u201ccourage\u201d on tax reform, with all three supporting revamping the stage-three tax cuts aimed at middle and high income earners.   Related: Australia\u2019s taxes \u2018inadequate\u2019 for \u2018adequate services\u2019, former secretary of finance warns    In comments to the Australia Institute\u2019s revenue summit on Friday, Le urged Labor to \u201creally consider their roots\u201d in providing more cost-of-living relief, such as reducing the petrol excise, while Ryan presented a plan to double rent assistance with savings from retaining the 37c tax bracket. The stage-three tax cuts, passed by the Morrison government in mid-2019, begin in July 2024. They remove the $120,000 to $180,000 tax bracket, increase the top tax bracket to $200,000 and reduce the marginal rate of tax for everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 to 30%. The Albanese government has insisted there is no change to Labor\u2019s plan to leave the stage-three tax cuts in place, arguing they help return bracket creep, which occurs when income earners face higher rates of tax as they move into higher tax brackets.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  At the revenue summit, Ryan said that retaining the 37c tax rate which applies to income above $120,000 would provide $8bn of additional revenue. This could fund a $3bn capital grant program to build 10,000 social houses a year and $5bn to double commonwealth rental assistance, she said. \u201cThis will support the most vulnerable people in our community though the toughest cost-of-living crisis in decades,\u201d Ryan said. Le, the member for Fowler, said the government \u201creally can\u2019t go ahead with\u201d and \u201cshouldn\u2019t go ahead with\u201d the stage-three tax cuts. Le cited the average income of $1,200 a week of her constituents in south-west Sydney, an income level of $62,400 a year that would see most worse off under stage three after the removal of the low and middle income tax offset. \u201cLabor is supposed to be for the working Australians,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I call on the Labor government to really consider their roots and how they can provide some relief now for working Australians.\u201d Pocock reiterated his calls to raise more revenue from the petroleum resource rent tax. In August, Pocock ruled out supporting Labor\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d changes which would collect $2.4bn more over the next four years but has been criticised for bringing forward rather than increasing revenues. On Friday Pocock said \u201cwe have to start getting a return for our resources\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve largely missed out on the fossil fuel export boom \u2013 it\u2019s not too late to put some good measures in place to get a return from that.\u201d Pocock also backed calls from teal independent MPs to introduce national road-user charging after the high court struck down Victoria\u2019s electric vehicle tax. Pocock said Australia needed a \u201cuniform road-user charge\u201d that considered the weight of vehicles because \u201cthat is what damages roads\u201d while also incentivising drivers to choose smaller more efficient vehicles. Pocock called for \u201ca really low level road-user charge, and use all of that revenue \u2026 to put it into charging stations and infrastructure which we desperately need\u201d. \u201cI think most EV drivers will probably be OK with that, if they were paying a couple of cents a kilometre \u2026 but it meant there were more chargers.\u201d   Related: You be the Australian treasurer: raise welfare, reform the tax system, go for a federal budget surplus    Pocock called on Labor to reconsider negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts, two policies it abandoned after its 2019 election defeat. After the Liberal senator Maria Kovacic suggested in September that the government could consider capping the number of houses investors could negatively gear, Pocock said there \u201cwould be a lot more people in the Coalition concerned about housing\u201d. \u201cBut there\u2019s people like Senator Kovacic that are courageous enough to say it out loud.\u201d The intervention from the crossbench comes as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development called on Australia to consider broadening the goods and services tax and potentially lifting the rate, to help rebalance the tax system so retirees take on more of a share alongside workers. Australia gets 26.5% of its total tax take from GST, compared to the 32% OECD average, although upping the rate comes with its challenges as all states and territories need to unanimously agree to change it. In its economic survey report for Australia, the OECD also urged the federal government to revisit tax concessions on superannuation. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the OECD report lined up well with Labor\u2019s economic plan. \u201cThe Albanese government\u2019s economic plan aligns with the OECD\u2019s agenda, including getting our budget into better nick, investing in our people and their skills, improving women\u2019s economic participation, broadening and deepening our industrial base, and embracing the opportunities of the net zero transformation,\u201d he said.", "Queensland koala funding diverted to rollercoaster could be much better spent, experts say [2022-07-29T20:00:07Z]": "The Queensland government\u2019s decision to quietly divert $2.7m from what it had previously promised would be a state-of-the-art koala research facility to build a rollercoaster instead was a public relations disaster. But the Queensland Conservation Council director, Dave Copeman, is not mourning the loss of the jettisoned Future Lab wildlife research centre at Dreamworld, nor its impact on marsupials recently declared endangered. \u201cThe fact that the most recent deforestation data shows that more than 90,000 hectares of likely koala habitat was cleared under the Vegetation Management Act is the real disaster,\u201d Copeman said. \u201cNot a koala tourism facility not being built.\u201d That description appears a far cry from how it was spruiked back in March 2019, when the then assistant tourism industry development minister, Meaghan Scanlon, trumpeted what she said would be Queensland\u2019s first native animal genome research facility. \u201cThe Dreamworld Future Lab will be a world-class research facility and will allow us to deploy experts to tackle some of the biggest issues facing our native wildlife \u2013 like the threat of chlamydia on the local koala population,\u201d Scanlon said at that time.

They added there \u201cwere of course added benefits that aligned with the government\u2019s priorities of preserving Queensland\u2019s koala population\u201d. The deputy director of the University of the Sunshine Coast\u2019s Genecology Research Centre, Prof Peter Timms, has been leading the fight against koala chlamydia. Though he was never involved in the Dreamworld Lab \u2013 which was to partner with the University of Queensland \u2013 he said it is \u201calways disappointing\u201d to see money diverted from any conservation research. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure it was the end of the world because it\u2019s a complex process, saving koalas, and trees are what matters most,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we keep knocking them down.\u201d But while land clearing is the number threat to koalas, he said that chlamydia is driving previously stable populations into decline. And Timms has a solution that could make \u201ca huge difference\u201d to the fate of the koala: a chlamydia vaccine. Timms said his team has developed a vaccine that is ready for production and is lobbying for $2.5m in government funds to roll it out nationally \u2013 $200,000 less than what was given towards the Steel Taipan rollercoaster. But the Dreamworld Future Lab may yet see the light of day.

Now that \u201cinternational travel is back\u201d, tourism officials have \u201creached out to Dreamworld to gauge their interest in restarting discussions about revisiting the koala research centre\u201d. Timms said that, if flying international tourists to hold koalas at tourist attractions helps the marsupials, \u201cit doesn\u2019t do it directly\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t misrepresent it.\u201d Copeman has his own suggestion for boosting tourism revenue.

The budget comes at a time of growing international economic turmoil and fears of a widespread global slowdown, along with increasing pressures on the domestic front that are hitting household budgets hard. While the budget bottom line is getting better compared with previous forecasts, spending pressures remain, and Chalmers has flagged that this budget will be the start of a national conversation about the fiscal challenges ahead. The budget will also be an important marker for the Albanese government five months after the election, making clear its priorities and direction for this term and beyond. So what do we know so far? The economy With households tightening their purse strings amid growing cost of living pressures, Tuesday\u2019s budget will show a slowdown in economic growth. Australia\u2019s gross domestic product is now expected to grow 3.25% this financial year, before nose-diving to 1.5% growth in 2023-24. In the March budget, the forecast was for GDP growth of 3.5% this year, and 2.5% next year.   Related: Housing, Indigenous and domestic violence services to receive extra $560m in federal budget    Inflation will also be revised up for 2023-24, going from a previously forecast 2.75% to 3.5% for 2023-24. For the current financial year, inflation will be almost double what was expected in March, going from 3% to 5.75%. Wages growth is not expected to get ahead of inflation until the following year, while unemployment will be revised upwards from 3.75 to 4.5%. International growth figures will also be downgraded, with a slowdown now expected in China, the US and the UK, and the budget figures to reflect a sharp contraction across these major economies.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  The bottom line With the economic shock of Covid now in the rearview mirror, and the economy benefitting from soaring commodity prices, the budget is expected to reflect an improved bottom line in the short term. Recently released figures for the final budget outcome for 2021-22 showed a $48bn improvement in the deficit to $32bn. Deficits will also be revised down for next year, but Chalmers has warned that spending pressures are continuing to build, and a structural deficit is expected to remain over the next decade. He has hosed down expectations of being able to deliver a surplus anytime soon. Debt also continues to grow, standing at $892.3bn as of 14 October. Spending The Albanese government\u2019s first budget will also account for commitments made in the lead-up to the election, along with a series of new commitments. A cheaper childcare package costing $5.4bn over the forward estimates was the largest of these, with the reform to come into effect in July next year. Among other large election commitments are aged care reforms costing $2.5bn, the cheaper medicines policy at $770m, extra university places at a cost of $485.5m, $220m for strengthening Medicare, and $54.3m for the electric vehicle discount policy. A $9.6bn infrastructure package \u2013 mostly announced before the election \u2013 will also be detailed in the budget, including $500m for the High Speed Rail Authority in NSW, $2.2 billion for the Suburban Rail Link in Victoria, $1.5bn for freight highways and more than $1 billion for roads in Queensland and Tasmania. The budget will also allocate an extra $560m for community organisations, including housing, Indigenous and domestic violence services, to help deal with rising inflation. Other significant costs to be reflected in the budget include the cost of servicing government debt, which is expected to grow by 14% annually, while spending on the NDIS will grow 12.1%, health 6.1% and defence 4.4%. The government has also identified an additional $6.4bn in unfunded programs and so-called \u201czombie\u201d savings measures that it will need to account for in Tuesday\u2019s budget. An increase to foreign aid has also been included in the budget, with a $900m boost to official development assistance (ODA) for the Pacific and a $470m increase to aid for South-East Asia. Savings As part of a \u201cline by line\u201d audit of previous spending commitments, the government has identified $10bn in savings that will come from cutting various projects promised by the former government. The budget will also cut $2bn in discretionary grant funding and include a \u201creprofiling\u201d of $6.5bn of infrastructure projects to give priority to its own commitments. Savings worth $3bn have been found through a commitment to reduce public service spending on contractors, consultants and labour hire companies, and another $570m from reducing advertising, travel and legal expenses. Tax After testing the waters on potential changes to the stage-three tax cuts, Chalmers has ruled out making any changes in this year\u2019s budget, despite the cost of the measure blowing out to $254bn over a decade. However, the budget will include plans to ensure multinational corporations pay more tax, with the move to raise $1.9bn over four years from 2023-24. It also forecasts a $3bn improvement to the bottom line by clawing back extra revenue through extending and boosting existing tax compliance programs.

From 2012 to 2021, per student funding to independent and Catholic schools rose by 34% and 31% respectively, while funding to public schools increased by just 17%, according to parliamentary library data provided exclusively to Guardian Australia. In Queensland, the growth in government funding to independent schools per student has been nine times greater than to public schools. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (Acara) data shows that 98% of private schools are funded above the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) recommended by Gonski and more than 98% of public schools are funded below it.   Related: Forget Victoria\u2019s private school tax uproar \u2013 public school students are still being shortchanged | Meredith Peace    \u201cThat money has gone to the wrong place,\u201d said Trevor Cobbold, an economist and the national convenor of Save Our Schools. \u201cIt has gone to those least in need.\u201d   Interactive   The Gonski review was hailed as the roadmap to reducing the impact of social disadvantage on educational outcomes. But more than decade later, government policy has had the opposite effect. Cobbold said the figures showed a \u201csabotaging\u201d of the plan by successive governments, both state and federal, which has shortchanged students in the public system.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cThe Gonski model wasn\u2019t perfect, there were some flaws,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it offered a change in terms of where funding would be directed in terms of the most in need, and that has not happened.\u201d The Greens education spokesperson, Penny Allman-Payne, said the gap in funding between private and public schools had created one of the most unequal and segregated school systems in the OECD.   Related: Sydney public high schools to go co-ed in Labor shake-up as parents face tough choices    A Unicef report in 2018 ranked Australia 30th out of 38 OECD countries in providing equitable access to secondary education. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the implementation of Gonski has been a failure. By no measure can anyone say, a decade later, that our school funding model is working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a twisted and perverse system that is widening the gap between rich and poor kids and lowering average student performance.\u201d The decade since Gonski One of the core recommendations of the Gonski review when it was released in 2011 was implementing the SRS, a needs-based model to provide a baseline education to students, set at $13,060 for primary students and $16,413 for secondary students. The federal education minister at the time of the Gonski review, Peter Garrett, said the aim was to ensure any student, irrespective of their background, could reach their potential. \u201cThe legislation we put in place meant Australia finally had a genuine needs-based funding system for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis required a massive effort to produce significant buy-in from most of the education sector Australia wide.\u201d But a briefing by the education department prepared for witnesses appearing before Senate estimates and seen by Guardian Australia, estimates that schools in the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Western Australia will reach only 75% of their SRS this year, with the remaining states and territories also falling short of 100%. On its current trajectory, the Northern Territory will never reach it. Cobbold said the failure to fund schools according to need could be traced back to key decisions made by successive governments after the Gonski review. The first kick to its success, he said, was the Gillard government\u2019s edict that \u201cno school would lose a dollar\u201d. A deal was struck with the Catholic system and other private schools \u2013 which were found to be overfunded at the time \u2013 to maintain their revenue from government.    Over the past decade, states have not been held accountable for delivering the full share  Correna Haythorpe     Documents released in June this year through freedom of information laws revealed more than 1,000 private schools \u2013 or 40% of Australia\u2019s non-government schools \u2013 would be overfunded by $3.2bn over the next six years. Cobbold pointed to the Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget, which scrapped the biggest increases in school funding agreed to under the Gonski reforms, planned for 2017 and 2018, the bulk of which would have gone to public schools. Cobbold said the funding model for public schools was further undermined in 2017, when the Turnbull government introduced an \u201carbitrary\u201d commonwealth funding cap of 20% for public schools, with the remainder to be covered by state governments. For non-government schools, the caps are the reverse.   Related: University of Melbourne vice-chancellor calls for free university education    The president of the Australian Education Union, Correna Haythorpe, said putting the onus on the states to implement 80% of funding failed to adhere to the Gonski review\u2019s recommendation that the commonwealth should put in more, given its greater capacity to raise revenue. \u201cWhat we know is that over the past decade, states have not been held accountable for delivering the full share,\u201d she said.   Interactive   Former New South Wales National party MP and former state education minister, Prof Adrian Piccoli, said the Turnbull government did cap the funding increase for schools that had reached 100% of the SRS \u2013 most of which were in the independent sector \u2013 after the Gillard government had promised to increase funding by 3% a year for all schools. \u201cWhat the Gillard government did was better than what was there before, what the Turnbull government did was a little better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was far from perfect.\u201d Cobbold said the final blow to funding schools according to need came from the Morrison government, which negotiated a $4.6bn increase in funding for Catholic schools over 10 years but no additional money for public schools. \u201cMorrison basically said it\u2019s up to the state governments [to fund public schools], but the state governments haven\u2019t been delivering either,\u201d Cobbold said. \u2018It can be a lot better and fairer\u2019 In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, state government funding in real terms has gone backwards since 2012, falling by 5.6% and 7.75% per student respectively, according to the Acara data. The overall funding disparities have not been spread equally across the country. Real government funding per student has increased by more than 16% in metro areas, more than 22% in inner regional areas, and more than 20% in outer regional areas. But in remote and very remote areas it has risen by barely 14% and 10% respectively.

Interactive   The federal government is now undertaking a review to inform the next National School Reform Agreement, with the aim to work with state governments to get schools to 100% of their SRS.

Julian Hill, the chair of the parliament\u2019s audit committee, said \u201cthe so-called Regional Growth Fund was yet another giant rorted slush fund\u201d, delivering 16 projects in Coalition-held electorates and just one in a Labor-held seat, the Coalition target of Lingiari. An analysis of the successful projects reveals that $261m was spent on the 16 projects in Coalition-held electorates and just $11m on the one in Lingiari.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  According to the department, all regional growth fund projects were approved by Michael McCormack, then deputy prime minister and regional development minister. Its answers note a ministerial panel also played a role selecting projects in consultation with cabinet. The regional growth fund was set up in the 2017-18 budget, intended to support \u201cmajor transformational projects\u201d. Despite being set up before the 2019 election, almost half ($132m) of its budget was spent in 2022-23. The Liberal-held seat of Forrest received two grants, of $13m for the Busselton jetty village, an \u201cunderwater discovery centre\u201d, and $10.35m for the Busselton entertainment, arts and culture hub. In the South Australian electorate of Barker, the Mount Gambier sport and recreation centre received $15m from the federal government. Hill said under the regional growth fund, \u201cif you weren\u2019t in a Liberal or National seat, you didn\u2019t get a look in\u201d. \u201cThey treated taxpayer funds as Liberal party funds, yet their government was so rotten to the core they still don\u2019t seem to get what they did was wrong,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. In response, McCormack told Guardian Australia that \u201c'program decision processes followed the publicly advertised guidelines and decisions were approved by cabinet\u201d.  \u201cThe Coalition held and holds more seats in regional areas. Each elected Government can create programs to deliver funding to areas of need and in establishing the regional growth fund, then minister Fiona Nash felt she was addressing the needs of eligible communities.\u201d McCormack queried why Labor \u201cdoesn\u2019t move on and do something rather than worry about something we did \u2013 they\u2019re in government now\u201d. \u201cAll of those [grants] were doing what the program was called \u2013 growing the regions,\u201d he said. McCormack noted that some regional grants programs were designed to deliver election commitments, likening them to Labor\u2019s blackspot program, which the opposition has criticised for disproportionately benefiting Labor seats. But the regional growth fund was designed as an open, competitive process \u2013 not to deliver projects selected through election commitments. The regional growth fund is one of a string of programs cancelled by the Albanese Labor government and replaced by $1bn over three years for competitive grants in the growing regions, regional precincts and partnerships programs. These included the controversial $1.15bn building better regions fund, which the audit office found resulted in Coalition seats receiving twice as many grants as Labor electorates. But two new Labor programs, announced in the October budget, will be delivered through closed grants: $1bn over five years for the priority community infrastructure program and $350m over five years to deliver small-scale community, sport and infrastructure projects. In March the audit committee revealed that the Morrison government\u2019s urban congestion fund allocated 83% of its projects \u2013 worth almost $3bn \u2013 to Liberal-held seats.

The government will continue to consider each project on a case-by-case basis, under the law.\u201d The government said no submissions had been received about the project during the public consultation period, including from environment groups. But climate campaigners had made public statements calling on Plibersek to reject the mine in line with scientific advice that no new fossil fuel developments should go ahead if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C. \u201cScientists, energy and climate experts have said that the climate cannot afford new coalmines, and they\u2019ve said it so many times I\u2019ve lost count,\u201d said Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute. \u201cThe fact that this is a small coking coalmine is beside the point \u2013 fossil carbon needs to stay in the ground. We\u2019ve already got more than enough coalmines approved to cook the planet, including coking coalmines that could run into next century. \u201cThis approval comes late in the evening in budget week, the perfect time for controversial news.\u201d The announcement comes a week after Plibersek cancelled two coal projects whose applications had lapsed. Dr Coral Rowston, the director of EnvA (Environmental Advocacy) CQ, a grassroots group in central Queensland, said the project would affect habitat for the vulnerable ornamental snake. \u201cThe other key issue for us is the mine will also leave a legacy for our water quality in central Queensland due to the release of affected water from sediment dams into the Isaac River which feeds into the Great Barrier Reef.\u201d Plibersek also plans to move three other projects \u2013 two in New South Wales and one in Queensland \u2013 to the next stage of the assessment process. The three mines are among a group of 19 proposed new coal and gas projects that Environment Justice Australia, on behalf of the Environment Council of Central Queensland, had sought to have reconsidered and effectively rejected because of their potential greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cToday\u2019s decision means minister Plibersek joins a long line of federal environment ministers who have said it\u2019s not their job to consider the climate risk of new coal and gas mines,\u201d the council\u2019s president Christine Carlisle said. The government found it could not stop the projects at this point in the process because national environmental laws state they would have to prove the emissions of a specific project would be a substantial cause of climate change effects on matters of national environmental significance. Of the remaining 16 projects, five have been withdrawn by the developers or cancelled by the government due to lapsed applications. Thursday\u2019s decision leaves 11 still to be reconsidered by Plibersek. Environmental Justice Australia senior lawyer Retta Berryman said: \u201cOur client is carefully considering all legal options in light of today\u2019s decision \u2013 including one or more federal court challenges.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 May 2023 to remove a statement from Coral Rowston referring to koala and greater glider habitat.

So what\u2019s going on? What are soft plastics? Simply put, they\u2019re plastics that can be scrunched into a ball. The term covers bread and cereal packets, vegetable packaging, chocolate bar wrappers and clingfilm. Australians use 70bn pieces \u2013 or about 538,000 tonnes \u2013 of soft plastics each year, according to the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (Apco). What was REDcycle? Formed in 2011, REDcycle was a national soft plastics collection and recycling program. It operated across 2,000 Coles and Woolworths supermarkets and some Aldi stores, with customers able to drop off used soft plastics for processing.   Related: Soft plastic, not fantastic: what to do with Australia\u2019s bread bags and chip packets    Before its collapse in November 2022, the program claimed to collect 5m items a day. Prior to 2018, most of those were sent to China. After that, some were mechanically recycled into road surfacing, bollards, benches and paths in Australia. But a mid-2022 fire at Close the Loop\u2019s Melbourne plant \u2013 where soft plastics were turned into an asphalt additive \u2013 took away a key recycling pathway. The fire was largely blamed for REDcycle\u2019s suspension along with a \u201cdownturn in market demand\u201d exacerbated by the Covid pandemic. Coles and Woolworths said in April 2023 that REDcycle had been stockpiling soft plastics without their knowledge while the scheme itself claimed it had been holding on to the waste while trying to ride out problems.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  What happened next? The discovery of 11,000 tonnes of stockpiled soft plastic at 44 storage locations across the country led to the establishment of the Soft Plastics Taskforce under the aegis of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and chaired by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. Its members \u2013 Coles, Woolworths and Aldi \u2013 were tasked with ensuring the rubbish would not reach landfill. In March 2023, the taskforce released a plan titled the roadmap to restart, which detailed a phased restart of soft plastic collections in stores from the end of the year. That deadline was not met. The taskforce has, however, \u201cconsolidated and safeguarded\u201d REDcycle\u2019s stockpiles and will run a small-scale soft plastics trial collection in the coming months. Just 120 tonnes have been recycled. Why does some packaging still come with the REDcycle logo? Today, Coles shoppers can still see the REDcycle logo and read about the scheme on the back of many own-brand products, including brussels sprouts and corn cobbettes. Woolworths customers are advised to return some own-brand packaging to stores. Brands including Uncle Tobys, Kellogg\u2019s and Cadbury continue to carry the REDcycle symbol on their packaging.    Both supermarkets told Guardian Australia the incorrect labelling was due to a desire to avoid adding to landfill. \u201cPackaging is often printed in bulk and used across products for months or years, so we\u2019re running down existing stock before we update the recycling label to ensure we don\u2019t create unnecessary waste,\u201d a Woolworths spokesperson said. The supermarkets also display in-store messages informing customers that REDcycle is no longer operating. Are supermarkets allowed to provide incorrect labelling? At the moment there isn\u2019t an independent authority that actively assesses recycling labels on packaging to ensure accuracy, an Apco spokesperson said.  But Jeff Angel of the Boomerang Alliance environmental group says: \u201cThe current labels are too close to greenwash and too far away from independent tracking and verification processes.\u201d What will the REDcycle logo be replaced with?   Related: Reduce, reuse, refuse: tips to cut down plastic use in your kitchen    Customers will begin to see a \u201ccheck locally\u201d Australasian Recycling Label on their groceries, Woolworths says. But asking households to check for local recycling options creates too high a barrier, says Angel, who believes the \u201cindustry has to be responsible, not just stick a label on it and say \u2018it\u2019s up to you, customer\u2019.\u201d New details on reforms to the regulations of packaging at federal and state levels are expected in May. Angel hopes the regulations will contain \u201cno escape clauses\u201d. How can consumers recycle soft plastics now? Generally, they can\u2019t. Most of Australia\u2019s 60-odd material recovery facilities, where rubbish is sorted for recycling, do not have the physical ability to handle soft plastic, which is often highly contaminated by food and made of multiple materials. A trial kerbside collection scheme has been under way in some councils in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, while Randwick, Hornsby and Bendigo residents can drop off soft plastics at recycling centres. Mosman, Central Coast, Newcastle and Tamworth councils all collect soft plastics via the Curby program. How are soft plastics recycled? Options are limited. Close the Loop\u2019s new Reservoir plant in Victoria launches on Wednesday and will use more than 3,000 tonnes of soft plastics a year to manufacture its asphalt additive. Other mechanical recovery companies include Polyrok, Replas, Plastic Forests and SaveBoard. A prototype KitKat wrapper, trialled on NSW\u2019s Central Coast in 2021, was made with 30% recycled soft plastic from Licella, which converts post-consumer plastics to oil that can then be used to create food-grade plastics. Licella is yet to work at scale in Australia. Chemical recycling options are not yet mature, while fungi, algae, black fly larvae and even edible plastics might one day help eliminate plastic waste. A fundamental problem with the recycling model is the small end market for expensive but low-grade recycled plastic. So long as the cost of virgin plastic is pegged to the low (and falling) cost of oil, why buy recycled? So what else can councils do with our soft plastics? Waste-to-energy treatment \u2013 burning plastics to salvage energy from their otherwise low-quality bulk \u2013 has been online for decades in Europe and is in development in Australia. Otherwise, it goes to rubbish dumps \u2013 where 93% of our soft plastics currently end up. \u201cPlastics are inert and as long as they don\u2019t leach chemicals into the groundwater, landfill is potentially a better place for them to go than using very energy-intensive processes,\u201d says Dr Ben Madden, a senior research consultant at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney. But there must be a better alternative? We could use less plastic. Australia\u2019s supermarket sector, which is valued at almost $135bn, has the power to drive innovation and push for non-plastic packaging, says Dr Tillmann Boehme, a circular economist at the University of Wollongong business school. \u201cSupermarkets are one of the most powerful players in the supply chain,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can have a lot more influence over manufacturers. They should lead, not be the last.\u201d What are Australia\u2019s recycling goals?   Related: Australia\u2019s plan to phase out expanded polystyrene packaging is failing and was never possible, industry says    The Australian Food and Grocery Council\u2019s national plastics recycling scheme will see food and grocery manufacturers paying a levy towards recycling the soft plastics they create. The government and industry\u2019s voluntary 2025 national packaging targets aim for 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging, 70% of plastic packaging to be recycled or composted, 50% recycled content in packaging and the phase-out of single-use plastics. The all-government national waste policy action plan is aiming for an 80% reduction of materials going to landfill by 2030 and to phase out problematic and unnecessary plastics by 2025. Sounds ambitious Packaging targets will almost certainly not be met. State, federal and local governments need to leap from a combined recycling rate of 40m tonnes to 60m tonnes in six years to meet the target of an 80% reduction of materials going to landfill. There is no way that can be achieved without new or increased levies, subsidies, grants, mandates or bans, says Mike Ritchie, the managing director of MRA Consulting Group. How much would it cost to fix the problem? REDcycle\u2019s budget was too small, with Coles and Woolworths paying a combined $20m to the scheme over the past decade. In July 2023, the Albanese government announced a $60m boost for soft plastics recycling, part of a $250m commitment to the recycling modernisation fund. Angel estimates addressing the problem will cost tens of millions of dollars a year. Other experts estimate that creating collection capacity could cost $180m plus $20m a year in operating costs. But that doesn\u2019t cover the recycling to follow.    Who is responsible for our plastics problem? \u201cNo one takes on responsibility for plastics,\u201d says Boehme. Federal, state and local governments all weigh in as do industry, consumer and environmental groups, but \u201cthere is no ownership \u2013 it is a mess\u201d. Does recycling soft plastics make a difference? Yes. But even if governments were successful in collecting and processing all soft plastics, it would divert only 10% of total plastics from landfill, experts say. So that bigger issue needs to be addressed, too. To put things in perspective, REDcycle collected less than 1% of the soft plastic used by Australians each year.  \u201cWe need to focus on the big waste streams and big solutions,\u201d Ritchie says. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 January 2024 to remove an incorrect reference to \u201cthermonuclear\u201d treatment of soft plastics.", "Commonwealth Games 2026: why has Victoria pulled out and what happens now? [2023-07-18T03:09:35Z]": "The Australian state of Victoria will not host the 2026 Commonwealth Games, after the state premier, Daniel Andrews, said the cost had blown out and he was not prepared to redirect money from other parts of his government\u2019s budget to make up the shortfall. \nTuesday\u2019s sudden announcement means that with less than three years to go, one of the major events in many athletes\u2019 calendars is now up in the air. \nThe decision by Victoria to scrap the Games just over a year after it announced the event to great fanfare is just the latest sorry chapter for the Commonwealth Games, as it struggles for hosts \u2013 and relevance. \nWhat has happened in the Commonwealth Games and why? \nThe leader of the Australian state of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, says his decision simply came down to cost. It\u2019s just 17 years since Victoria last hosted a Commonwealth Games, so when his government announced its bid it said it would be \u201cdifferent\u201d. The government planned to host the event across five regional sites and predominantly outside the major city of Melbourne. \nIn April last year, when Andrews thanked the Games\u2019 organisers for accepting his bid, he acknowledged it could be more difficult than other editions. \u201cI\u2019m sure from their point of view, it\u2019s a bit riskier than just running it in the middle of a large city,\u201d he said. \nOn Tuesday, Andrews said the cost of hosting had grown beyond his expectations. \u201cWhat\u2019s become clear is that the cost of hosting these Games in 2026 is not the $2.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) which was budgeted and allocated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is in fact at least $6bn and could be as high as $7bn.\u201d \nCommonwealth Games Australia chief executive Craig Phillips has said that he sees the stated cost overrun as \u201ca gross exaggeration\u201d. \nHe added that \u201cthe Victorian government wilfully ignored recommendations to move events to purpose-built stadia in Melbourne and in fact remained wedded to proceeding with expensive temporary venues in regional Victoria.\u201d \nAndrews has said the government will still build the sporting facilities it had promised regional communities, but he would not take money from other parts of the budget, such as health, to deliver the games. \nWho was set to pay for the Games? \nThe Victoria government had faced questions for some time over how the Games would be paid for. $2.6bn was initially allocated, but in the state\u2019s May budget, no additional funding was set aside.  \nAn argument over funding with prime minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s federal government doesn\u2019t appear to have helped matters. \nWhile the federal government\u2019s budget in May included more than $1bn for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games, nothing was allocated for the 2026 Commonwealth Games. Andrews vowed to not let the commonwealth \u201coff the hook\u201d for help to fund the event.  \nIn June the federal sports minister, Anika Wells, told Guardian\u2019s Australian Politics podcast that the Albanese government was \u201cstill working through with the Victorian government their proposal for federal support\u201d. \nWhat next for the 2026 Games? \nWithin hours of Victoria\u2019s announcement, the neighbouring state of New South Wales \u2013 whose state capital Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympic Games \u2013 said it would not step in, citing budgetary pressures. The leaders of other Australian states, with the exception of Queensland, poured cold water on the idea, too. \nThe games have only been cancelled twice in their history \u2013 in 1942 and 1946, both due to the second world war. It\u2019s unclear whether a new host will be able to be found in time, but the Games have form at finding willing and able cities to host at short notice. \nIn 2015, the South African city of Durban was awarded the 2022 Games after its only competitor in the bid \u2013 the Canadian city of Edmonton \u2013 withdrew citing cost concerns. \nJust two years later though, the city was stripped of the rights to host after failing to meet promises contained in its bid. Like Andrews, South Africa\u2019s sports minister cited financial constraints, saying \u201cWe gave it our best shot but we can\u2019t go beyond. If the country says we don\u2019t have this money, we can\u2019t.\u201d \nIn 2017, Birmingham and the British government stepped in to save the 2022 Games. The UK government stumped up more than \u00a3560m to ensure the Games could go ahead in the West Midlands city, and the local council putting in another \u00a3190m. \nBirmingham had been scheduled to host the 2026 Games and so the 2022 decision left a hole in the schedule. The Commonwealth Games Federation was due to announce the 2026 host city in 2019, but the decision was postponed until 2020, and then again to 2021, and then again to 2022. \nFor the 2026 race, Kuala Lumpur, Cardiff, Calgary, Edmonton and Adelaide all pulled out from proposed bids because they were concerned about costs, leaving Victoria as the only viable candidate. \nIs it just about money? \nIn recent years, criticism of the Games has expanded beyond just the financial burden. The colonial origins of the Games \u2013 they were once known as the British Empire Games \u2013 have also been a point of contention, as have their inability to attract younger audiences. \nPrior to last year\u2019s Birmingham games, British Olympic diver Tom Daley also condemned the homophobia across many Commonwealth countries. \nOut of 56 member states, 35 criminalise same-sex relations, making up half of the countries globally that outlaw homosexuality. Seven Commonwealth nations have a maximum penalty of life imprisonment under laws imposed by Britain in the 19th century when it was a colonial power. \nDame Louise Martin, the president of the Commonwealth Games Federation, has said she recognises that the Games need to adapt and modernise in order to maintain their \u201crelevance\u201d. But after today\u2019s announcement, that task will be all the harder. The CGF must find a new host for 2026, while at the same time securing a host for their centenary in 2030, after a bid from the Canadian city Hamilton collapsed earlier this year.", "Proceeds of crime: gambling firms keep millions when Australians steal to fund addiction  [2022-11-28T14:00:23Z]": "In 2018 a 27-year-old Tasmanian assistant financial accountant was convicted of multiple counts of fraud after stealing $292,955, most of it from his employer.

He was sentenced to jail and was issued with compensation orders, despite being deeply in debt. \nSportsbet kept the money. \nIn 2021 a 48-year-old Tasmanian woman faced court after stealing $940,221 from the veterinary practice where she worked, and accruing a debt of $24,218 on a fraudulently obtained credit card.

She played the game through Facebook, which took a 30% cut of every transaction. She was convicted of 26 counts of fraud and ordered to compensate the companies she stole from, despite the court noting she was already in debt and unlikely to be able to repay them. \nAristocrat and Facebook kept the money. \n \n  Related: \u2018I would have had my own house by now\u2019: the devastating effects of a life in thrall to the pokies   \n \nIn September Gavin Fineff, a former Sydney financial adviser pleaded guilty to multiple fraud-related offences in the NSW district court. Fineff lost more than $8m to sports gambling, much of it belonging to his clients and friends, some of them elderly and vulnerable. \nThe victims of his crimes never got their money back.

No one asks the simple question, \u2018How do we return the stolen funds to the victims?\u2019\u201d \nHow is regulation supposed to work? \nStates and territories are primarily responsible for regulating gambling companies, but they are also captured by federal anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Those laws require companies to report suspicious transactions, including money going in and out of the country and payments over $10,000, to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. \nThey also require companies to investigate customers\u2019 sources of wealth. Austrac can investigate companies for noncompliance with the laws. \nWhen the Tasmanian accountant started stealing money from his employer to fund his gambling, he transferred funds from workplace credit cards to a PayPal account, which he then used to deposit money into his Sportsbet account. The court heard that between January and June 2017 he conducted 248 transactions, with a steep escalation of activity in April and May, which paralleled his intensifying gambling. \nAs the transactions increased, PayPal queried why he was receiving so many payments from his employer\u2019s credit cards. He responded with fraudulent information and set up a new PayPal account to hide his behaviour. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nPayPal said it could not comment on individual customers. \n\u201cPayPal adheres to all relevant laws, regulations and compliance requirements in markets in which we operate. The company remains committed to fulfilling its regulatory obligations and we report applicable transactions to Austrac.\u201d \nSportsbet, like many other online gambling companies, is licensed in the Northern Territory, where regulation has historically been more relaxed than in other jurisdictions. But in 2019 the Territory government legislated codes of practice for online gambling companies, obliging them to train staff to identify and act upon \u201cproblem gambling red flag behaviours\u201d, which include \u201cgambling for an extended period\u201d, \u201cchanging gambling patterns\u201d, \u201cincrease in deposit frequency\u201d and \u201cescalating sums of money deposited\u201d. \nA spokesperson for Sportsbet said the company \u201cacted appropriately at all times and is comfortable that all legal and reporting obligations were complied with\u201d in relation to the case. The company would not comment on whether it carried out any investigations into the man\u2019s betting. \nSportsbet was not ordered to release the funds it received from him, nor has it voluntarily done so. \n \n  Related: \u2018Socially aware\u2019 superannuation funds among those investing billions in gambling industry  \n \nThe game on which the Tasmanian woman lost her money, Heart of Vegas, is based on simulated poker machines, marketed as exact replicas of the actual machines in Las Vegas.

The deputy chief executive of regulatory strategy at Austrac, Peter Soros, told the ABC in 2020 gambling companies that did not perform additional due diligence on high-risk customers \u201crun the risk of not complying with our laws\u201d. \nLevin says that when a salaried young finance professional deposits hundreds of thousands of dollars in the space of a few months with major gambling companies, it should raise obvious red flags. \n\u201cShouldn\u2019t they have suspected something?\u201d \nAndrew Wilkie, an independent federal MP has campaigned for years to tighten legislation. This year he put forward a private member\u2019s bill that would give Austrac the power to make compensation orders against gambling companies if they allowed a customer to gamble \u201cin circumstances where there were reasonable grounds to suspect the person would pay for the service using stolen property\u201d. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nWilkie\u2019s bill, written with Fineff\u2019s assistance, would also put a \u201cpositive obligation\u201d on the companies to report to Austrac any suspicion that a person was gambling using stolen money.  \n\u201cIt is grossly unfair that the gambling companies keep the stolen moneys, while addicted people are jailed and their victims are left with nothing,\u201d Wilkie says. \n\u201cThe current patchwork of state and federal laws fail to protect us because these laws are weak and rarely enforced.\u201d \nState-based victims of crime compensation schemes exclude property-related crimes from their remit, leaving victims of gambling-related fraud and theft with no avenue for redress. \nLevin suggests that there may be a role for the commonwealth director of public prosecutions to act on behalf of victims to get money back from gambling companies, but that would require someone to investigate and refer the case to them. \n\u201cBasically, no one has bothered looking for the money to give back to the victims,\u201d she says.  \nShe notes that in Sweden bets shown to be funded by the proceeds of crime are void and companies must forfeit the money. In the UK there are provisions to strip operators of profits, along with pathways for victims to get their money back. \n\u201cIf the legislation we have doesn\u2019t work in practice, then we need to fix it,\u201d Levin says. \u201cThere is no good reason for gambling operators to profit from crime-funded gambling. \n\u201cThat is just wrong.\u201d", "Chalmers offensive: crunch time as treasurer faces first federal budget | Katharine Murphy [2022-10-21T19:00:47Z]": "Sometime after midnight on a freezing morning in August 2002, 24-year-old Jim Chalmers swum the length of the fish pond at University House at the Australian National University.

Michael Cooney, a close friend since their ANU post-grad days, says Australia\u2019s treasurer is one of the few people of his acquaintance with the brio to dive into a fishpond in the dead of Canberra\u2019s winter \u201cand the poise to make such good use of it\u201d.   Related: The Coalition scoffed at the idea of a wellbeing budget. But Australians want Jim Chalmers to deliver | Rebecca Huntley    On Tuesday, Chalmers will have his chance to walk further and forward, defining himself, defining the new government, when he delivers the Albanese government\u2019s first budget. It\u2019s a big moment for a new treasurer only five months into the portfolio. Nerves would be understandable. But he\u2019s a veteran of the ritual. Chalmers has staffed 16 budgets as a backroom adviser in opposition and in government. In the parliamentary parlance, this makes him the father of the Canberra lock-up. Chalmers has known the secretary of Treasury, Steven Kennedy, for 15 years. His chief of staff, Claudia Crawford, worked with him when they both worked for Wayne Swan, the Labor treasurer who piloted Australia through the global financial crisis. He understands the bureaucracy and the regulators. The econocrats and their rituals are as familiar and comforting as a pair of old socks. Katy Gallagher, the finance minister, is a friend as well as a colleague. Gallagher is regarded by many cabinet colleagues as the EQ of the Albanese government. The treasurer says preparing a budget with her is like being \u201chit in the arse with a rainbow\u201d.    Given his political apprenticeship, much about being treasurer feels very familiar. But Chalmers is making two transitions. The first is from the backroom to front of house. The second is opposition to government.  Chalmers advised Swan during the global financial crisis. In opposition, he helped craft pre-election policy during a global health emergency that became a supply shock. In government, he\u2019s assembling his first budget in the middle of a global inflation shock, with rising interest rates and the potential for major economies to tip into recession. While market analysts scan the horizon for a hard landing, flood waters in eastern Australia continue to rise, inundating crops and property, creating a new round of supply shortages and inflationary pressure. The treasurer spent the Rudd-Gillard years as a private actor, often in the rooms where it happened, never on the news. This backstory makes him both a veteran and a fresh, next-generation figure; as one colleague puts it, Chalmers is the class captain of the parliamentary intake of 2013. The class of 2013 included a number of former senior staffers, freed hostages, decoupled from the feuds and intrigues of their mentors. The unofficial motto of this cohort is never forget, never repeat.   Related: Australia\u2019s economic outlook to be downgraded in budget amid global \u2018deterioration\u2019    When we speak this week, I ask Chalmers to tell me what he\u2019s learned from his privileged vantage point. He says three things. If you want to stay in government, you need to do big things slowly and little things quickly. Pacing always matters. Unity matters. If there\u2019s \u201cnot a collective coherence to the cabinet then you compromise your achievements\u201d. And the third is a lesson about time. It takes an eternity to win government, and you can be past-tense in the blink of an eye. \u201cYou wake up one day and it\u2019s finished, it\u2019s over. It goes so quickly.\u201d Promises, problems and puzzles Chalmers hails from Logan City, south of Brisbane. He lives 900 metres from where he grew up. Logan is classic struggle street. The treasurer\u2019s constituents in the seat of Rankin live on the frontline of the current inflation shock and they won\u2019t benefit from stage-three tax cuts costing the budget $254bn over 10 years. Tuesday\u2019s budget will also see the end of the low- and middle-income tax offset, a tax break worth up to $1,080 a year. The treasurer\u2019s mother is a nurse who worked night shift. His father, a courier driver, left the marriage when Chalmers was 13. He has two older sisters but was home alone at night for most of his adolescence. He says he was a badly behaved kid who could have spiralled. A high school history teacher found a way to reach him and give him a sense of purpose. Chalmers tracked towards politics through university, culminating in the doctoral thesis at ANU. He worked in the Queensland bureaucracy, then Labor politics, with the organisational wing the entry point.    Chalmers met Anthony Albanese in the same year he staged the Hawke homage in the University House fish pond \u2013 2002 \u2013 when he worked in Labor\u2019s national secretariat with Tim Gartrell, then an ALP assistant national secretary, now Albanese\u2019s chief of staff. At their first meeting, Albanese was in a tracksuit. Gartrell was helping him move apartments. The two struck up an easy friendship. Albanese was close to Swan and used to visit the office frequently during the long nights of Rudd-Gillard. Often, Albanese would have a nightcap with Chalmers. The prime minister and the treasurer share a March birthday, although there\u2019s a 15-year age gap. This relationship survived the complexities of the Rudd-Gillard civil war, but was tested after the 2019 election. After Bill Shorten lost, Albanese hoped to take the party leadership unopposed given he had support from the overwhelming majority of the left faction and from chunks of the right. But Chalmers was encouraged to run. A next-generation rightwinger from Queensland as federal leader was considered a smart response in some quarters of the party to the devastating election result, and Chalmers gave stepping up serious thought. But ultimately, Albanese got his wish. He would lead by acclamation. Chalmers would be shadow treasurer. Wanting the same prize frayed their relationship. Things have turned a corner, but it took time, patience and demonstrations of goodwill to restore equilibrium. Maintaining that equilibrium will be critical to the success of the new government. It is possible for prime ministers and treasurers to be too close. Josh Frydenberg, who bunked in with Scott Morrison at the Lodge during the pandemic, and was bundled out of parliament in May in a visceral, anti-Morrison swing, could perhaps shed some light on the perils of proximity. But avoiding poison in the relationship is also critical. Governments work best when prime ministers and treasurers trust one another and pursue common objectives. Right now, the first Albanese-Chalmers budget has to deliver election promises and set signposts to the future. But the challenges the new government faces are already crowding in and things will get harder as time passes. The global economy is volatile. The budget is in structural deficit, and spending on important social services and defence is baked in and rising. So is the interest bill on the accumulated debt. The budget has a revenue problem, and Labor just won an election by shedding the controversial revenue measures voters rejected in 2019.    There is an obvious tension between maintaining election promises and doing what needs to be done. With Albanese\u2019s endorsement, Chalmers recently began making the case for winding back the fiscally irresponsible stage-three tax cuts that Labor promised to keep in the run-up to the May election. But that particular conundrum won\u2019t be resolved in next week\u2019s budget. Having lost elections in the past because of perceptions of scary taxes and broken promises, there is collective paranoia about not repeating past mistakes. I wonder if Chalmers thinks Labor needs an explicit mandate at another election to bring the budget back in order. The answer is clearly no. \u201cI don\u2019t think our major budget challenges can wait years down the track,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it would be strange to identify pressing structural spending pressures and say we can\u2019t deal with them for four or five years.\u201d   Interactive   The treasurer wants next Tuesday to be the start of a conversation that will span four budgets. \u201cI\u2019ve got three little kids at home,\u201d Chalmers says. \u201cWe do a lot of jigsaw puzzles. When you tip the box out and you\u2019ve got 100 pieces or 500 pieces and you\u2019ve got all this jumble, what do you tell your kids? You tell them to start with the corners. The corners are inflation, another corner is the wasted decade \u2013 skills shortages, an energy crisis, an aged care crisis, wage stagnation. Another corner is floods. How are we going to fund the support people need and deserve? \u201cYou start with the corners, with the edges, and you fill it in. We might have four budgets this term. Three, maybe four. I\u2019ve tried to think about this journey not as a budget every now and again, but three or four budgets that we colour in over time.\u201d    I think people are sick of the schmaltz and the fakeness of economic commentary. They want something real, even if it\u2019s a bit spiky  Jim Chalmers     I wonder whether or not the journey from the corners of the jigsaw to the centre requires some kind of structure or scaffold. Something like the Henry tax review that was convened by the Rudd government after the \u201cAustralia 2020\u201d summit in 2008. Does a conversation like this need an event to give it both momentum and a focal point? Chalmers can\u2019t be definitive on that point because a decision like that is always collective. But the treasurer\u2019s predisposition is clear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rule out some form of formality [like a review] but it\u2019s not my inclination. I feel like there is a structure around the current conversation and that\u2019s a bit different to the immediate aftermath of the 2020 summit. \u201cI do want to engage people, engage experts, have a structured conversation, but I haven\u2019t instinctively reached for a review headed by a person or a panel because I feel like people broadly understand the issues.\u201d    Walking further, and forward Chalmers says Keating remains the gold standard in political communication about the economy. \u201cWhat he did best was include people in a conversation about the economy and talk up to them rather than down to them,\u201d Chalmers says. \u201cI think about that almost every day. How do I take the complexity of the economy and the budget and not dumb it down but explain it and level with people about what we are grappling with; try and give them the sense that there\u2019s a lot of 50-50 calls in managing the economy. That\u2019s the sense I want to give.\u201d   Related: Jim Chalmers says cost of stage-three tax cuts has blown out to $254bn over 10 years    He acknowledges he\u2019s learning on the job. \u201cI don\u2019t always do that eloquently or elegantly. You are always trying to find a balance but I really try and talk up to people rather down to people and one of the main reasons I\u2019m trying to be different to my immediate predecessor is I think people are sick of the schmaltz and the fakeness of economic commentary. They want something real, even if it\u2019s a bit spiky.\u201d Real and spiky is the unavoidable fact that the budget needs more revenue. Despite the enormous pent-up need in Australia after a decade of policy drift, the times also call for expenditure restraint, both to subdue inflation and rebuild the fiscal buffers in the event of a new global downturn. Chalmers will unveil a temporary windfall on Tuesday. Tax receipts will be revised up by more than $100bn over the forward estimates, but that bonanza will quickly wash through. One key test of policy seriousness on Tuesday night will be how much of that windfall Labor spends.    Looking ahead, the treasurer says the response to the challenges of our times will require different strategies than the ones Hawke and Keating deployed in the 1980s to transform Australia\u2019s economy and set the country up for decades of economic expansion. Doing what needs to be done will involve Albanese and Chalmers walking further, and forward. This week I ask Chalmers to define what that means for him. He says you can\u2019t pay tribute to Labor leaders past by retracing their steps or swimming in the same pond. \u201cOur equivalent is delivering clean, cheaper and more reliable energy, it\u2019s turning the massive multibillion superannuation pool to our advantage when it comes to our national economic priorities,\u201d Chalmers says. \u201cLooking forward for us means doing something meaningful about climate, it means getting the human capital piece right, getting the investment flowing in modern ways, and not photocopying agendas from the 1970s or the 1980s.\u201d At the moment, the central policy battle in the portfolio is inflation. \u201cI feel the cost of living thing properly because you don\u2019t have to be a genius to understand the pressure people are under,\u201d Chalmers says. He understands the political stakes. In 2025, voters will judge Labor\u2019s performance on its merits, and the mark will be pass or fail. \u201cThere is pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I feel that pressure every day.\u201d", "White House meeting: key takeaways from Anthony Albanese\u2019s visit to Washington [2023-10-26T05:03:23Z]": "Anthony Albanese is in the final stages of an official visit to Washington. He wanted to engage the president of the United States, Joe Biden, on a range of policy fronts during the four-day trip. Here are the key takeaways from the visit. Trouble with nuclear submarines When the prime minister arrived in Washington, dysfunction in the legislature was on full display. The House of Representatives had been paralysed for three weeks because there was no speaker. This chaos affects the biggest defence project in Australia\u2019s history. The Biden administration needs to be able to pass legislation underpinning the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine pact. Three bills sit in the queue: ship transfer legislation, export control legislation, and a supplementary budget request for submarine industrial base support. Whether they emerge from the queue remains anyone\u2019s guess.    Related: Aukus will \u2018get done\u2019 despite jitters in Congress, Biden tells Albanese at White House meeting    Also anybody\u2019s guess: whether Biden\u2019s commitment to Aukus will be honoured by Maga Republicans in the event they win back the White House in 2025. Given the known unknowns, Albanese needs the incumbent president and key US lawmakers to focus on assembling and future-proofing the Aukus nuts and bolts. Ensuring the right people are focused was one of the key objectives of this visit.  Biden was asked by a reporter whether he could give a personal guarantee Aukus-related legislation will pass. As it happened, the president could not. In response to the question, the president said: \u201cDo you know anyone in an elected office [who] can give a personal guarantee that it happens?\u201d The journalist persisted: \u201cWell, we\u2019d like you to try.\u201d Biden responded: \u201cI\u2019m going to try. And I believe it will get done.\u201d Keeping US eyes on the Pacific Just as Australia needs Biden to be focused on Aukus, both the Albanese government and the Dutton opposition want the US focused on, and engaged in, the Pacific. The reasons for this are obvious. China is becoming the regional hegemon. Australia remains dependent on the US for our security.   Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Albanese and Biden have unveiled a number of joint measures in the Pacific, including co\u2011financing infrastructure projects in Kiribati such as the rehabilitation of Kanton wharf and Charlie wharf in Tarawa. According to a joint statement from the leaders, Australia and the US will engage Pacific nations to develop and deploy a pilot initiative in the region to increase national cyber resilience. There are also joint climate change-related commitments, including a bonds program to help small firms in the Indo-Pacific work on the energy transition and an effort to ensure financing from the green climate fund is targeted to \u201cthose most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including least developed countries and small island developing states\u201d. The race to net zero Sticking with the energy transition, another key focus of the trip has been a bilateral discussion about critical minerals. Gaining reliable supply of the commodities required to power the net zero world is one of the biggest emerging geopolitical power plays. As the US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, noted this week: \u201cChina has a headstart, and that means we have to work a little harder and a little faster. [China has] the technology and sustained investment over a long period of time, particularly in midstream processing and refining, to dominate the market for critical minerals.\u201d  The US wants a secure supply chain of commodities to build batteries and electric vehicles. Australia also wants to develop a domestic battery industry. Raimondo again: \u201cAs we race towards a more stable supply chain, there\u2019s a moment for us, US and Australia, to partner as it relates to critical minerals to our mutual benefit.\u201d Albanese put it this way: \u201cWe want to move Australia up the international value chain in critical minerals, energy and manufacturing.\u201d  As a downpayment on this objective, Australia announced an expansion of the existing critical minerals facility during this Washington visit. The expansion was worth $2bn. But industry players say much more needs to happen, and soon. Cyber and space Albanese opened his trip by confirming a significant new investment by the US computing giant Microsoft in Australia\u2019s hyperscale cloud computing capacity and cyber defence. The announcement in Washington came ahead of the government\u2019s release of a new Australian cybersecurity strategy covering the period to 2030. Release of the new Australian strategy is expected within weeks.    Related: Australian artist \u2018a tad hysterical\u2019 after Albanese gifts her bushfire painting to Biden    The two leaders are also collaborating on policies related to space. The strategic competition between the US and China extends beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There is a renewed space race between countries and between billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Biden and Albanese will sign a new technology safeguard agreement that will allow more launches of US rockets from Australia. The two leaders also welcomed progress in negotiations of a \u201cbilateral space framework agreement\u201d to facilitate private investment in assets like commercial spaces stations. Canberra, Beijing, Washington, Tokyo With strategic competition with China the consistent backdrop to the trip, the two leaders also took steps to bring Japan closer. Albanese and Biden said they would explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on drones to \u201cenhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy\u201d.  Biden said the whole piece \u2013 Aukus, cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the Quad grouping with India and Japan \u2013 was not an attempt by the US and its allies to surround China. It was an attempt to maintain stability. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about \u2026 it\u2019s about maintaining stability. Stability. The Taiwan Straits, the Indian Ocean, that whole area. And I think it\u2019s going to increase the prospects for long-term peace rather than anything else.\u201d", "Morning Mail: budget\u2019s $14.6bn cost-of-living relief, tributes to Zonfrillo, second Texas tragedy [2023-05-07T21:04:07Z]": "Good morning.

Housing is back in the political spotlight, with Anthony Albanese refusing to rule out a double dissolution election if the Senate refuses to pass the bill.

The health minister, Mark Butler, on Wednesday announced the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme changes, which are part of next month\u2019s budget.  Under the changes, about six million Australians will be collect two months\u2019 worth of medicine for the price of one month, essentially halving the cost. The changes will take effect from 1 September and apply to 320 common medicines, including for chronic conditions such as heart disease, high cholesterol, Crohn\u2019s disease and hypertension. Butler said the move will save patients more than $1.6bn over the next four years. General patients can expect savings of up to $180 a year for each medicine, while concessions card holders will be $43.80 better off for each medicine. The Australian Medical Association has been pushing for the change, which was recommended in August 2018 by the independent pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee. The policy was welcomed by the patient advocacy peak body the Consumer Health Forum but will probably spark backlash from pharmacists, who will see a cut to their government subsidies for dispensing medicine due to fewer patient visits. Despite giving patients two months of medicine for the price of one, the government expects to save money from the measure through fewer GP visits and lower pharmacy subsidies. It promised that every dollar saved will be reinvested into community pharmacies.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  With repeats and two-for-one scripts, doctors can give patients 12 months\u2019 supply of a medicine before a new prescription is required. The government says GPs will retain the option to issue a one-month supply if there is any risk to the patient. It insists the policy won\u2019t add to medicine shortages because overall demand for medicines will remain unchanged. \u201cAfter nine years of cuts and neglect, the government has looked at all options to make healthcare more affordable for Australians,\u201d Butler said. He said changes from 1 January cutting the maximum co-payment for medicine from $42.50 to $30 had \u201calready saved Australians over $58 million on 5.1 million prescriptions\u201d. \u201cEvery year, nearly a million Australians are forced to delay or go without a medicine that their doctor has told them is necessary for their health. \u201cThis cheaper medicines policy is safe, good for Australians\u2019 hip pockets and most importantly good for their health.\u201d Dr Elizabeth Deveny, the chief executive of the Consumer Health Forum, said the change would provide \u201cassistance for cost-of-living pressures\u201d allowing patients to \u201cbetter look after their health\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of evidence that many Australians are choosing paying their mortgage or rent over the medicine they need, getting the kid\u2019s medicine but not their own, or the doctor gives them a list of medicines and they get some but not all of it, or they take their medicine every second day,\u201d she told Guardian Australia.   Related: Doctors v pharmacists: who benefits from Australia\u2019s turf war over prescriptions?    Deveny said the policy was a \u201chuge boon\u201d for patients in rural and remote areas who have to travel great distances for prescriptions, or those who require additional assistance from carers. She said patients\u2019 \u201cNo 1\u201d demand was still \u201ctimely, affordable and fair access to primary care\u201d, urging the government to do more to help Australians \u201cto see their health professional, get in quickly when they need to\u201d. The Australian Medical Association president, Steve Robson, said the policy had \u201cenormous potential to make it easier to see a GP\u201d. \u201cA lot of people won\u2019t have to go for repeat prescriptions and that will free up an enormous number of GP appointments to allow people who have changes in conditions to get appointments,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Robson said the policy was \u201clong overdue\u201d and \u201ca great outcome\u201d and to help the \u201cincreasing proportion of Australians skipping medicines just because can\u2019t afford them\u201d. The Pharmacist Guild of Australia has been lobbying for its members to have power to prescribe common medications, after a pilot scheme in Queensland and similar trials in New South Wales and Victoria. GPs oppose that measure.", "Australian renters face surging costs after end of national affordability scheme [2023-03-30T14:00:06Z]": "Ruth Johnson was afraid her rent would surge when it was no longer covered by a federal government subsidy program. She was right. For three years, Johnson was one of 32,000 renters benefiting from the National Affordability Rental Scheme (NRAS), a Rudd-era program that paid property owners a subsidy in exchange for them keeping rents on new homes below market rate for a decade. Under the NRAS, Johnson\u2019s suburban Brisbane townhouse cost her $272 per week \u2013 until last May, when the subsidy expired. When Guardian Australia first spoke to Johnson in October 2021, she was working part-time and sole-parenting her toddler. She had moved into the NRAS property after unexpectedly becoming a single parent a few months before her daughter was born.   Related: \u2018I am panicking\u2019: the vulnerable renters at risk as housing subsidy expires    \u201cI needed support and NRAS was there to offer that support. The thought of being without it is quite frightening,\u201d she said at the time.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  NRAS cost approximately $3.1bn over its lifetime, which critics said was too much for the relatively small amount of affordable housing it made available. It was scrapped by the Abbott government in 2014. The homes already participating were grandfathered and new ones were unable to join. Johnson\u2019s rent increased immediately to $320 per week after her home was phased off the scheme. In the past few weeks, she was notified that it was increasing again, to $400 per week. \u201cReally all they said is \u2018this is market value for the area\u2019. The rental crisis in general is crazy,\u201d Johnson said. She has had to return to full-time work to pay for the increases despite wanting to spend more time with her preschool-age daughter. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Johnson said.  Emma Greenhalgh, chief executive of national housing advocacy organisation National Shelter, said Johnson\u2019s story was \u201cnot unusual\u201d, especially for those in NRAS homes owned by investors rather than community housing associations. About 30% of all NRAS properties were located in Queensland, by far the highest concentration. About half of all properties nationally were owned and managed by private companies, and half by not-for-profit community housing groups. Many NRAS properties have already exited the scheme; all of the subsidies will have expired by 2026. In her previous role with Q Shelter, Greenhalgh said she had spoken to many NRAS tenants in Johnson\u2019s situation. \u201cPeople were highly distressed \u2013 particularly people who had come off the housing register originally,\u201d Greenhalgh said. \u201cIt\u2019s fear and stress and powerlessness.\u201d To address the rental crisis, the Queensland state government this week put forward a proposal to limit rent increases to once a year, but has come under fire from tenants advocates who say the proposal does not go far enough. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, also said on Wednesday that the government, in partnership with a community housing organisation, would \u201cinvestigate\u201d buying up to 335 of the 5,000 homes that will be sold after they exit NRAS in the next couple of years. It comes as the federal Labor government\u2019s signature housing program, the Housing Australia Future Fund, became locked in a stalemate after the Coalition, the Greens and key independent senators refused to support it. Independent David Pocock said the bill needed \u201cmore ambition\u201d while Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather called it \u201ca $10bn gamble on the stock market where the volatile returns are invested in housing\u201d. HAFF would invest $10bn and then spend the earnings, up to $500m a year, on affordable and social housing projects. There had been a lot of \u201cfrustration\u201d in the housing sector around the future fund debates this week, Greenhalgh said. \u201cThe housing crisis, it didn\u2019t happen in one year \u2013 this has been a decade in the making.\u201d   Related: Labor\u2019s $10bn social housing bill in limbo as negotiations with Greens deadlocked    National Shelter was broadly supportive of the fund but wanted it \u201coptimised\u201d and \u201cimproved\u201d. The organisation has called for the federal government to invest an additional $2bn into a rapid response housing fund that would allow housing providers to increase affordable housing more quickly through means other than construction \u2013 for example, through spot purchasing or renovation. Johnson said she has not sought a new rental because the idea of trying to negotiate the current rental market was too stressful. \u201cI\u2019ve watched a lot of people end up homeless with their stuff on the side of the road,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are single mothers out there putting up posts on Facebook saying, \u2018come and collect my belongings, I have nowhere to live\u2019.

As the plan\u2019s assessment date of June 2024 draws closer, environment groups are becoming increasingly concerned about the states\u2019 failures to deliver on moves designed to deliver water for the environment via efficiency projects. Of particular concern is the final 450GL of extra water that South Australia demanded as its price of signing on to the plan a decade ago.   Related: Murray-Darling Basin plan in chaos as Victoria and NSW oppose further water buybacks     This water for environmental flows was due to be retrieved by on- and off-farm water efficiency projects, such as covering canals, but this proved an expensive way to retrieve water and difficult to implement, with just 5% of the target achieved after nearly 10 years. The Albanese government committed $146.8m in Tuesday\u2019s budget towards their election promise to complete the Murray-Darling Basin plan, but this is mainly for scientific studies and work to assess progress. Australia\u2019s peak conservation groups covering every basin state said more funding will be needed to reach basin plan targets and restore the rivers to health after a decade of delay \u2013 and they want water buybacks from farmers, not promises of projects.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Farmers oppose buybacks because they say they reduce agricultural activity and hurt communities. \u201cUnder the Coalition, we lost years and billions of dollars on bloated handouts and dodgy offset schemes. Now water\u2019s more expensive, the Albanese government needs to allocate more money for water recovery,\u201d Tyler Rotche, Environment Victoria\u2019s healthy rivers campaigner, said. \u201cThe Albanese government has some leftover funding. The bulk of the $1.575bn to recover 450bn litres went unspent while the Murray-Darling faced mass fish kills and toxic blackwater events.\u201d \u201cThe government needs to get the most water for the funds already set aside. Purchasing water from willing sellers is the most reliable option. It\u2019s by far the most straightforward, aboveboard and cost-effective method on the table.\u201d Environment Victoria, Nature Conservation Council New South Wales, Queensland Conservation Council and the Conservation Council of SA said additional funding was needed and it should be used to buy water from willing sellers rather than projects as this was cheaper and more effective. \u201cWhile the decision not to fund the dud Dungowan Dam near Tamworth is applauded, the money saved should have been repurposed for water purchases,\u201d Jacqui Mumford, the CEO of the Nature Conservation Council NSW, said. \u201cThe solution is simple. We need stronger laws to stop over-extraction, purchase more environmental water, and invest in regional communities,\u201d she said Plans for a new Dungowan Dam near Tamworth were all but buried last October when the budget review revealed it had been deferred following a very unfavourable assessment from Infrastructure Australia. Tuesday\u2019s budget formally axed it. The NSW water minister, Rose Jackson, announced on Wednesday that NSW would also abandon the project. The move will save NSW taxpayers $632m and would enable the state government to look at more affordable and effective water security options for the region. \u201cWe know there is a major water security issue in this region and we are committed to addressing it but at the end of the day the numbers didn\u2019t stack up,\u201d Jackson said. In the coming weeks, the NSW government will be releasing the final Namoi water strategy, which will outline the path forward and plan to improve water security in the region. \u201cIt is going to take more than just a new dam to solve the water security issues for Tamworth. It is why I am now receiving briefings from my department on a range of infrastructure and non-infrastructure options that could be implemented within a shorter timeframe,\u201d Jackson said. The Dungowan Dam project had been championed by the former National party leader Barnaby Joyce, in whose electorate it is located, as a water security measure for nearby Tamworth, which came close to running out of water during the drought. But advisers, including the Productivity Commission, declared it a flawed project that was about delivering more water for agriculture, when other cheaper options could boost the town water supply.", "2022 budget: Jim Chalmers delivers national housing agreement to build 1m homes [2022-10-25T06:00:28Z]": "A national plan to build 1m new homes before the end of the decade will be announced in the federal budget as part of a historic agreement between governments, investors and the construction sector. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will announce the national housing accord during Tuesday\u2019s budget, which will include the target of building 1m \u201cwell-located\u201d and energy-efficient homes in five years, starting from 2024. The budget will include $350m in additional federal funding for the construction of 10,000 affordable homes over the five-year period, while state and territory governments have committed to building to 10,000. Chalmers said this was on top of the $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund, promised by Labor before the May election to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties in five years.   Related: You be the treasurer: scrap the stage-three tax cuts, spend money, or pay down the federal budget deficit    \u201cWe want more Australians to know the security of decent housing and more Australians realising the aspiration of homeownership,\u201d he said in a joint statement with the housing minister, Julie Collins. \u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that we work together to ensure there is an adequate supply of affordable housing where it is needed \u2013 close to jobs, transport and other services.\u201d Chalmers said the accord, signed by federal, state and local governments, as well as institutional investors \u2013 including superannuation funds \u2013 and the residential development, building and construction sectors, recognised the majority of housing supply \u201cneeds to come from the market\u201d.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Government, he said, would play a \u201ckey role in enabling and kickstarting investment\u201d. \u201cRelative to comparable countries, Australia has a low level of institutional investment in housing,\u201d the accord reads. \u201cAt the same time, we have the world\u2019s third-largest pool of capital in our superannuation system, which is hungry for investments that will deliver stable returns over the long term for the benefit of members.\u201d The Treasurer\u2019s Investor Roundtable, a forum established earlier this month involving the government, the chief executives of the nation\u2019s big four banks and the heads of the largest superannuation and investment funds, will meet in November to discuss private investment in housing. The accord also details short- and long-term actions to address supply problems, including by improving zoning and planning regulations and releasing state and Commonwealth-owned land for social and affordable housing. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about 985,000 new homes were built over the five years to March 2022, though the majority were completed before 2018-19. Since then, home completion rates have been declining, largely due to rising labour and material costs, with an estimated 174,000 homes built in 2021-22. Treasury forecasts there will be about 180,000 housing completions on average across the next three financial years, which is consistent with estimates from the Master Builders Australia and the Housing Industry Association. Last month, the Productivity Commission described the private rental market as \u201cthe epicentre\u201d of the nation\u2019s housing affordability problem and recommended state and territory governments commit to firm targets for new housing supply. In 2020, the Victorian government announced a $5.3bn \u201cbig housing build\u201d to fund 12,000 new social and affordable homes in four years.   Related: Budget deficit to halve this financial year but spending pressures mean boost will be short-lived    Earlier this year, it announced a levy on developers to fund 1,700 new social and affordable homes each year after the end of the big build, but it was scrapped within days after opposition from industry groups. It is also hoping to increase homeownership in the state by tripling the size of its Victorian Homebuyer Fund to $1.1bn. The fund allows homebuyers to purchase with a 5% deposit, with the government providing up to 25% of the purchase price of the home. Homebuyers can then buy out the government\u2019s share at market value over time, with payments reinvested to help others enter the property market. The Queensland government, meanwhile, recently announced $2bn to deliver 13,000 social and affordable homes by 2027.

And they\u2019re potentially worsening inequality \u2013 11,000 Australians have mega super balances of over $5m, and a lot of that isn\u2019t even being spent in retirement, it\u2019s just an accumulation of wealth at the top end. \nMy colleague Paul Karp has broken the discussion down in this quick explainer. \nTop news \n \n Wage growth lower than expected | Salaries increased at a faster pace in the December quarter, but not enough to prevent the gap with inflation (7.8%) widening to a record level. The wage price index for the final three months of 2022 came in at 3.3%, an increase on the 3.1% pace in the September quarter and the highest since the end of 2012. Economists had forecast a 3.5% increase. \n Woolworths and Santos post bumper profits | The flipside to the inflation crisis is a boost in profits in sectors like supermarkets and energy. Woolworths reported a $907m net profit for the six months to December, up 14% from the previous corresponding period. And energy giant Santos\u2019s underlying profit more than doubled in 2022, coming in at $3.6bn, up from $1.4bn the year prior. \n \n \n Experts condemn Queensland child bail law | Experts say there is zero evidence to support Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s controversial decision \u2013 which includes overriding the state\u2019s Human Rights Act \u2013 to pursue criminal charges against children who breach bail. \u201cI know of no evidence anywhere in the criminological literature that would support the effectiveness of such a measure,\u201d Ross Homel, a criminologist at Griffith University, said. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to increase the number of kids in pretrial detention.\u201d \n Former Victorian minister lobbied for a property developer | \u2026 in exchange for donations to the 2018 election campaign of his daughter, the state\u2019s corruption watchdog has found.

The pre-budget announcement on Monday pledged the emergency funding over the next four years for Trove, plus an additional $9.2m in ongoing annual funding, to save what the arts minister, Tony Burke, called one of Australia\u2019s most significant historical and cultural resources. Trove, the expansive archival database that holds billions of images, newspapers, documents, manuscripts and myriad other resources that are freely accessible to the public, was under threat of closure earlier this year, with its funding under the previous Coalition government scheduled to end on 30 June.   Related: Australian War Memorial funding dwarfed that of other cultural institutions in Coalition\u2019s final years    Trove is counted among Australia\u2019s most popular internet domains and receives more than 20m hits each year. On Monday, Burke described Trove as Australia\u2019s \u201cdigital memory\u201d. \u201cThis funding helps restore and maintain our strong cultural infrastructure \u2013 a key pillar of Revive, the government\u2019s new national cultural policy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt takes us a step closer to ending the budget cuts and culture wars of the previous government.\u201d  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  In January, the National Library\u2019s director general, Marie-Louise Ayres said Trove had been treading water for years under a funding model no longer fit for purpose, surviving on about $5m annually. There has been a groundswell of support, with collecting institutions, historians, researchers and members of the public lobbying the Albanese government in recent months. In February, Professional Historians Australia issued a public statement saying the threat to Trove funding was \u201cjust one of many crises\u201d facing Australia\u2019s national cultural institutions due to decades of budget cuts and minimal investment in cultural infrastructure. \u201cLeft unchecked, it may result in exacerbating a distinct disinterest and a dangerous lack of understanding about the importance of our cultural heritage,\u201d the statement said. On Monday, Ayres said in a statement she was delighted Trove\u2019s future had been secured. \u201cHardly a day goes by when I don\u2019t hear from a member of the public about what Trove has made possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether that is the history of a group of trees around an oval in the suburb next to my own, or the history of the LGBTQI Jewish community, or research into the Queensland Native Police, or even the ways in which endometriosis has been handled in the Australian media, or when specific fish species were last sighted in inland rivers \u2013 I never cease to be amazed at the curiosity and ingenuity of Australian researchers, and delight in that curiosity. \u201cAnd I am so pleased that satisfying that curiosity will be possible for many, many years.\u201d", "\u2018Nonsensical\u2019: Indigenous leaders say no point in regional voices without national body [2023-04-19T06:31:23Z]": "Remote Indigenous community leaders have told a federal inquiry it would be \u201cnonsensical\u201d for the voice to parliament to be made up of regional and local bodies without a national body advising Canberra. \nLeaders from remote communities in Cape York, the Torres Strait and Far North Queensland passionately advocated for a voice during Wednesday\u2019s public hearing in Cairns. \nNed David, chairperson of the Gur A Baradharaw Kod Torres Strait Sea and Land Council, told the parliamentary committee into the referendum that the model advocating local and regional bodies, put forward by the Coalition, did not make sense. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything more nonsensical to have just a voice for the regional and nothing to the formal connection to a national setting, I think that\u2019s silly, you need that connection and that seat at the table,\u201d David said. \n\u201cI can\u2019t see how you would have a disconnect between a voice at a regional and local level and not one that sits across a national narrative. I can\u2019t see the justification or the rationale behind that,\u201d he said. \n \n  Related: Yes or no: party politics on the road to the voice - podcast  \n \nHe said that while it was important to contextualise regional and local issues and priorities, there must be a conduit to national decision making. \n\u201cAll the big decisions that are made nationally that impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, all First Nations people are done at that level,\u201d he said. \nCape York Land Council chairperson, Richard Ah Mat, also advocated for the voice be able to make representations to executive government. \n\u201cTo be genuine and to have the sort of influence and authority you would need to have both, you would need to be able to talk to both the executive and parliament,\u201d Ah Mat said. \nDavid dismissed claims the voice would trigger a deluge of legal action as \u201cfear mongering\u201d. He said claims like this stirred unfounded fears that Indigenous people would seek to claim title over people\u2019s back yards after the Mabo decision. \n\u201cThis is the fear mongering that government can do \u2026.

The company has applied to expand its Peak Downs mine in the Bowen basin, which it operates in a joint venture with Mitsubishi. Under the proposal, the mine would be expanded into a new area of the site covering about 4,000 hectares. It would involve clearing of habitat for the endangered koala, greater glider and other threatened species. In a referral submitted to the federal environment department, the company says the latest end date for the project, if approved, would be 2116.   Related: BHP to close NSW\u2019s largest coalmine in 2030 after failing to sell it    Harriet Kater, the climate lead at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the move to extend the mine for 93 years was \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine anyone had a straight face when they keyed those dates in\u201d. \u201cWhat part of net zero by 2050 does [BHP] not understand?\u201d she said. \u201cThe company has been speaking out both sides of its mouth on climate change for too long. \u201cIt is hard to imagine that BHP\u2019s carefully curated reputation for climate leadership can withstand such decisions for much longer.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  In August BHP said any BMA (BHP Mitsubishi Alliance) metallurgical coal growth was on hold after changes to Queensland\u2019s resource royalty scheme. The company has however previously indicated it does not believe high-quality coking coal demand is likely to reduce any time soon. In the same month, BHP sought federal approval to build another metallurgical coalmine south of Blackwater in central Queensland. That project would run for up to 90 years. \u201cBHP\u2019s attempts to expand its Peak Downs project and mine coal for another 93 years demonstrate how hollow its recent threats were over the Queensland government\u2019s modest royalties increase,\u201d said Ellie Smith, the spokesperson for Lock the Gate Alliance Queensland. Smith said the proposal had been submitted to the federal government in the same week the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, launched a new threatened species action plan promising no new extinctions of any Australian wildlife. \u201cUnfortunately, this [proposal] also means the many threatened animals in the path of BHP\u2019s planned expansion face a real threat.\u201d A spokesperson for the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance said: \u201cThe world will need reliable long-term supplies of higher quality metallurgical coal for steelmaking, to support economic development and to make the infrastructure required for decarbonisation. They said they remained concerned about the Queensland government\u2019s \u201csignificant\u201d increase to coal royalties. \u201cThe near tripling of the top royalty rate will make future Queensland projects less competitive and less likely to go ahead.\u201d", "\u2018You are still overweight\u2019: how a doctor\u2019s health advice triggered Sarah\u2019s eating disorder [2023-09-11T15:00:08Z]": "Sarah Cox was admitted to hospital and placed on a feeding tube because she was malnourished, yet hospital staff discharged her with a weight loss plan. \u201cI was told: \u2018You\u2019re still overweight, you still need to lose weight.\u2019\u201d Cox says her eating disorder began after she was told by her GP to lose weight and that her body mass index (BMI) was too high at every appointment she attended throughout 2018-19, despite displaying no indicators of poor health such as blood test abnormalities or high or low blood pressure.  Cox remembers raising concerns with her GP about the diet after she passed out multiple times and being told: \u201cYou are still overweight. You need to ramp it up, not ramp it down.\u201d   Related: Ryan\u2019s rule: the Australian right to a second medical opinion that may soon be saving lives in England    In 2020 Cox developed atypical anorexia, an eating disorder with all the same symptoms as anorexia except the person never becomes clinically underweight. Between 2020 and 2021, Cox was admitted to hospital more than 10 times. Experts in diet and nutrition say cases such as Cox\u2019s reveal why health, not weight loss, needs to be the focus of public health messaging, but that dietary guidelines from government bodies are doing the opposite \u2013 contributing to eating disorder risk.  &nbsp;Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Cox says when she was treated by one of the chief psychiatrists in eating disorders for Queensland, he told her she would never have developed a disorder if medical professionals had not put so much pressure on her to lose weight.  Dr Fiona Willer, a dietitian and lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology, says the primary risk of developing an eating disorder comes from trying to change one\u2019s weight, yet it is a message reinforced by some doctors and health departments. \u201cEveryone\u2019s saying, \u2018if you\u2019re larger-bodied, you should try to be smaller-bodied\u2019.\u201d The National Eating Disorders Strategy, released last week to guide policies, programs and services over the next decade, identifies challenging weight stigma as one of the key social and environmental factors that can help prevent eating disorders. \u201cThis includes ensuring that policies related to nutrition, physical activity and weight management do not contribute to eating disorder risk,\u201d the strategy states.    But the federal government\u2019s website for dietary health guidelines, eatforhealth.gov.au, include \u201ctips for losing weight\u201d while the CSIRO\u2019s website tells Australians they can \u201close 3x more weight\u201d through its total wellbeing diet, giving examples with before and after pictures captioned \u201cTerry lost 100kg\u201d and \u201cAdele lost 18kg\u201d. Willer says the government\u2019s weight-centric position echoes stigmatising beliefs in the wider community and health professionals can also be affected by weight stigma. The federal and New South Wales governments\u2019 health department websites, as well as the Victorian government\u2019s Better Health Channel, include BMI calculator tools, despite experts saying it is not necessarily useful as an indicator of an individual\u2019s health. Cox says BMI calculators were a \u201chuge driving force\u201d for her eating disorder. She says she used \u201cevery one of them\u201d \u2013 including those on the Australian Heart Foundation\u2019s website and on the government\u2019s website for its 2011 \u201cswap it, don\u2019t stop it\u201d campaign. The campaign featured a cartoon balloon person with a tape measure they pulled tighter around their waist, which Cox says added to the weight stigma. Fusing the concepts of weight and health is incorrect, Willer says. \u201cPeople can be completely well nourished in a smaller body, a medium-sized body, a large body, a much larger body. \u201cWe have a huge disconnect between what weight science says and what policy currently says and we have a whole heap of weight discrimination hanging from that misinformation,\u201d she says. The nutritionist Rosemary Stanton says the promotion of weight loss \u201cdoesn\u2019t come from health, it comes from this whole idea of an ideal body image\u201d. Stanton says the focus on healthy eating needs to replace the idea of weight loss, otherwise it creates a culture where people are encouraged to diet and think that medications can help them to lose weight. She says she is particularly \u201chorrified\u201d by people thinking that injecting themselves with Ozempic is a good way to lose weight. \u201cPeople have lost the pleasure of eating,\u201d she says. Public health messaging, Stanton says, has largely focused on addressing people with a weight that is hazardous to their health. \u201cIt\u2019s a balancing game \u2026 and we\u2019ve probably balanced it the wrong way and ignored eating disorders.\u201d   Related: These women were told their babies would not survive \u2013 but Catholic-run public hospitals refused to provide abortions    Willer says for weight stigma to decline, body size should be added to weight discrimination laws and public health messaging should overtly state weight is no longer a relevant factor. Instead, health and wellbeing need to be the central values, Willer says, especially because \u201cwe know with level-A certainty\u201d weight lost through dieting tends to come back within two to five years. Asked whether there were plans to change the language on government websites to adhere to the new eating disorder strategy, a federal health department spokesperson told Guardian Australia the government would \u201cconsider how messaging, communication methods and platforms are tailored to different groups and use positive, contextual and culturally safe language to avoid weight related stigma and disordered eating\u201d. Cox says she recovered from anorexia only after being admitted to a health facility last year where staff told her they were not looking at the scales to work at her ideal weight but at her health indicators. \u201cAnd then this year has been the first year I\u2019ve had my life back.\u201d  In Australia, the Butterfly Foundation is on 1800 33 4673.

Proponents have argued that using fossil fuels to create hydrogen and sequestering the emissions \u2013 so-called blue hydrogen \u2013 could lower the price and boost demand, paving the way for a later switch to renewables to create green hydrogen versions of the nascent fuel. \nOpponents, though, say the cost of capturing and storing the resulting carbon emissions will likely render fossil fuel-sourced hydrogen uncompetitive. \nShort-term contracts, long-term problems \nGuardian Australia understands the federal and state governments have been asked for \u201cmultiples\u201d of the $50m both have so far invested in a project that is not expected to reach commercial scale before 2030. \nWorse, the Japanese partners are offering contracts to take hydrogen produced in the Latrobe valley for fewer than five years. The project owners would then have to sign up alternative customers at a time when green hydrogen supplies should already be available. \nGuardian Australia approached Tim Pallas, Victoria\u2019s treasurer and the government\u2019s most outspoken backer of the Latrobe project, for comment. \u201cWe will work with Japan and the commonwealth to further assess the commercial, technical and environmental feasibility of the project,\u201d a government spokesperson said. \nA spokesperson for the federal climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the Albanese government welcomed \u201cthat Japan looks to Australia to enhance efforts to build the global hydrogen industry\u201d, but said Bowen had not received a request to support the next stage of the project and did not comment on the length of the proposed offtake contracts. \nJeremy Stone, the non-executive director of one of the Japanese partners, J-Power Latrobe Valley, said the consortium was \u201cgrateful for the ongoing support of the Australian and Victorian governments\u201d, but declined to comment on the request for more funding. \n\u201cThe length of offtake agreements will be confirmed once we have finalised our current round of feasibility studies,\u201d Stone said. \nJapan Suiso Energy, the organisation responsible for clean hydrogen liquefaction, storage and loading in Victoria, is yet to determine how the \u00a5220bn grant from the Japanese government \u201cwill be split between these elements\u201d, he said. \nThe Australian Hydrogen Council, an industry group, said the HESC project would not require renewable energy resources that were needed for other parts of the state\u2019s decarbonisation efforts, labelling it an \u201calternative pathway\u201d to the \u201cmain game\u201d of renewable hydrogen. \n\u201cWe can utilise it so long as there\u2019s a sequestration solution,\u201d said Katerina Aleksoska, the international general manager at the AHC. \u201cIf [the Guardian\u2019s] information is correct [and] only short-term contracts are being offered, it will make the project more challenging.\u201d \n \n  Related: Is hydrogen really a clean enough fuel to tackle the climate crisis?  \n \nAnalysts such as Llewelyn Hughes, a Japan specialist at the ANU\u2019s Crawford school, say a short-term contract contrasts with the long-term deals the LNG industry has signed with Asian customers. Santos\u2019s GLNG venture in Queensland, for instance, underwrote its main operations with a 20-year contract with South Korea\u2019s Kogas. China and Japan have a range of 25-year contracts. \n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know what role hydrogen is going to play ultimately in Japan\u2019s decarbonisation efforts,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real risk of some winding back.\u201d \nAndrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest, who is pouring billions of dollars into developing green hydrogen, said the Japanese investment in Latrobe was \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d but \u201cI simply wouldn\u2019t do it\u201d. \n\u201cCarbon capture and sequestration, statistically, has been a massive, abject failure. It literally waits for the next sucker to come along,\u201d he said. \nDepending on the size of the residual emissions from the project \u2013 since not all of them can be capture and sequestered \u2013 the venture might also attract costs under the new safeguard mechanism passed by the Albanese government. \n\u201cThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water is developing an international best practice emissions intensity value for new hydrogen production under the safeguard mechanism,\u201d Bowen\u2019s spokesperson said, adding that new hydrogen producers \u2013 if covered by the mechanism \u2013 would have to meet baselines or purchase offsets or credits to make up the difference. Victoria\u2019s D\u2019Ambrosio said \u201cit\u2019s a no-regrets investment for the commercial proponents, but we get the added emissions\u201d. \n\u201cYou have to ask: is this a good deal for Victorians?\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n", "Sydney weather: temperatures set to soar to 30C when band of heat arrives at end of this week [2023-09-12T05:18:48Z]": "Temperatures in Sydney are set to hit 30C at the end of the week, with a band of heat forecast to stretch from Bega to the Hunter Valley on the New South Wales coast. Dylan Bird from the Bureau of Meteorology said that from Friday until Monday, large parts of NSW would experience temperatures 10-14C above average, possibly peaking at 30C in Sydney. The warm weather is being caused by a high-pressure system over south-east Australia with northerly winds pushing warm air south-eastwards from Queensland and central Australia.   Related: Sydney\u2019s urban fringe braces for hot, dry summer as firefighters warn over bushfire risks    \u201cIt\u2019s the first real warmth since last warm season,\u201d Bird said. \u201cWe will get a front or a trough to clear the heat eventually, but not until Tuesday or Wednesday next week.\u201d Sydney Marathon runners will take on the unseasonal heat as well as 42.195km on Sunday. About 40,000 runners are expected to compete across multiple events, with the full marathon drawing more than 14,000 runners. Weatherzone predicted marathon start-time temperatures of 17-19C, rising to 28C by the close of race. Average temperatures for the month of the event range from 11C to a high of 20C. Smoke from hazard reduction burns in the Sydney area and the predicted warm weather were both on marathon organisers\u2019 minds on Tuesday. In a statement, the Sydney Marathon race director, Wayne Larden, said organisers were working with the Rural Fire Service and the BoM ahead of Sunday\u2019s race. \u201cSydney Marathon has taken several precautionary steps, including increasing the availability of hydration capacity and medical assistance points along the course. This is in addition to the existing rigorous safety protocols and medical support available on course,\u201d he said. He said the RFS was working to minimise the impact on the Sydney Marathon. A high of 27.9C was recorded on marathon day in 2019 \u2013 while the year before, in 2018, the marathon took place on a day that reached just 17.4C, according to BoM charts. The bureau has not yet declared an El Ni\u00f1o for the summer ahead, but Bird said the agency was observing climate criteria closely and that the phenomenon, now given a 70% chance of emerging, was \u201cvery likely\u201d. It forecasts a hotter, drier summer for much of Australia, owing to the likely El Ni\u00f1o and the Indian Ocean Dipole development. Sydney residents have been told to prepare for a high risk of bushfires this summer, while prolific vegetation growth has added to fuel loads as bushfire season approaches.", "Budget management in a time of big-spending Victorian election campaign promises [2022-10-14T19:00:45Z]": "For decades, the Victorian Coalition has traded on the idea that it is a better economic manager than Labor. Which makes it surprising to see it has so far pledged $19bn more than the government on election promises, while simultaneously vowing to bring \u201cwasteful spending under control\u201d. The Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO), which tallies political parties\u2019 election commitments ahead of the November election, shows at the time of writing the opposition has announced 216 promises, of which 165 are funded, at a cost of $24bn. This includes commitments within the past week to cap the daily fare of public transport in Melbourne at $2 and halve regional fares. Experts have raised concerns about the viability of the plan but it was well received by voters struggling with cost of living pressures, which has left some in Labor\u2019s ranks rattled.   Related: Victorian Liberal leader distances himself from party HQ after shock departure of its legal adviser    According to the PBO, the $2 public transport cap will cost $1.3bn over four years, while the estimated cost of halving regional fares was not disclosed by the opposition. The opposition maintains both commitments will be paid for by reining in \u201cDaniel Andrews\u2019 spiralling debt and wasteful spending\u201d, under \u201cstage one\u201d of the Coalition\u2019s \u201clong-term economic plan\u201d. The plan includes a legislated debt cap to prohibit any future government from exceeding the limit without parliamentary approval. The shadow treasurer, David Davis, is yet to specify what the limit will be, arguing he needs a clearer sense of the state\u2019s financial position to do so.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  The plan includes the opposition\u2019s commitment to shelve the $34.5bn Suburban Rail Loop project to pay for new and upgraded hospitals (though less than $10bn is freed up by doing so) and a comprehensive audit of Labor\u2019s major projects. \u201cOur debt cap will bring wasteful spending under control. There will be no new taxes. There will be no cuts \u2013 the only cuts will be to Labor\u2019s wasteful spending,\u201d the Liberals said earlier this month. Davis has warned, as recently as Friday after the release of treasury\u2019s annual financial report, that the state\u2019s predicted net debt of $167.5bn by 2025-26 will \u201cexceed that of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania combined\u201d. This is equivalent to about 7% of total revenue, the highest proportion since the mid-1990s when it hit 14%. At the time, the state\u2019s precarious economic situation led the then premier, Jeff Kennett, to embark upon an austerity program that involved cutting more than 45,000 public service jobs, the closure of hundreds of schools and hospitals and the privatisation of billions of dollars worth of public assets. But David Hayward, an emeritus professor of public policy and the social economy at RMIT University, says that\u2019s \u201cno comparison\u201d to the current economy and \u201cno justification for panic\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for people to become obsessed with the state\u2019s debt. It\u2019s time the analysis shifted from debt to looking at the assets the government has accrued or how it has used that money,\u201d Hayward says. He says about two-thirds of Victoria\u2019s debt was incurred during the pandemic, to prepare the health system and support jobs and businesses. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would argue that it would have been better not to have had that health investment. People would have died,\u201d Hayward says. \u201cAs for the infrastructure spend, think about all the assets that have been built up as a result.\u201d   Related: Controversial ex-Liberal Geoff Shaw to run for United Australia party in Victorian election    Friday\u2019s annual financial report showed the state\u2019s 2021-22 deficit was $13.8bn, an improvement of $3.8bn from when the budget was handed down in May. The treasurer, Tim Pallas, credits this to lower than forecast demand for Covid testing and PPE, and an additional $1.2bn in revenue as the economy bounced back. Net debt was just under $100bn, equivalent to about 19.4% of the state\u2019s economy, $2bn lower than the budget estimate. As for election commitments, Labor has made 31, all of which are funded, at a cost of $5bn. However, the election commitment tracker doesn\u2019t take into account government announcements, which means projects such as the $6bn new medical precinct and upgrades to the Royal Melbourne and Royal Women\u2019s hospitals, are not included in the tally, despite the important role they will play in Andrews\u2019 campaign for a third term in office. As the campaign begins to ramp up and more promises are made, how each party spruiks their economic management credentials will be interesting to watch.", "Federal budget 2022 summary \u2013 winners and losers: who will benefit and who was left behind?

It also reduced and \u201crealigned\u201d support for CCS away from new fossil fuel developments. Instead, the government promised $141m over a decade to develop CCS in \u201chard-to-abate\u201d industries in which there were few alternatives to cut emissions, such as cement manufacturing. Some of the funding would also be directed to \u201cnegative emissions\u201d technologies that aim to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it, such as direct air capture.   Related: ABC given $83.7m to reverse Coalition\u2019s funding cuts but little help for arts in 2022 budget    But the bulk of that CCS funding has been delayed until after the four-year period set out in the budget papers, pushing it beyond 2025 \u2013 and the next election. The government confirmed previously announced climate and environment commitments, including $20bn over 10 years for its rewiring the nation program to provide low-cost finance for new electricity transmission links. About $6bn of that was promised last week to help build the Marinus link \u2013 two new subsea transmission cables across Bass Strait \u2013 and the Kerang link between Victoria and New South Wales. It said it would establish a $1.9bn \u201cpowering the regions\u201d fund to support jobs and emissions cuts in regional areas. There was $47.1m over four years for the Climate Change Authority, which has been given an expanded advisory role after having its funding slashed by the Coalition, $306.5m for community batteries and and solar banks and an extra $275m for electric and zero emissions vehicle charging.

It said physical impacts such as higher average temperatures and more extreme weather events would increasingly affect Australia\u2019s fiscal position. As they became more frequent, they would lower productivity, damage physical capital and disrupt some regions and industries. This would erode the country\u2019s tax base and \u201cput upward pressure on expenditure\u201d \u2013 in other words, force governments to spend more. The government said it would include indicators of the impact of climate change and a list of climate spending in each budget. It said it would ensure climate considerations were better incorporated in decision-making by training the public service and rebuilding Treasury\u2019s climate modelling capability. The budget papers made clear the impact of climate change was already being felt. They included preliminary estimates that this month\u2019s current floods would lower GDP growth by about 0.25 percentage points. The damage was expected to add 0.1 percentage points to inflation in this quarter and again next quarter, mainly due to higher fruit and vegetable prices and supply chain disruptions. A table of key climate-related spending lists $24.9bn in commitments over the next eight years, with rewiring the nation and powering the regions the largest. In the environment portfolio, the government promised $1.8bn in what the minister, Tanya Plibersek, called a \u201cdown payment on strong action to protect, restore and manage\u201d nature. The biggest chunk was a previously announced $1.2bn for programs to support the Great Barrier Reef promised over a decade.   Related: Budget 2022 summary \u2013 winners and losers: who will benefit and who was left behind?    Labor\u2019s climate and environment programs were funded in part by redirecting $746.9m from programs promised by the Coalition, including $325.9m from an energy and emissions reduction program that included money for gas and CCS projects and $89.9m that had been dedicated to the former government\u2019s low-emissions technology investment roadmap, which also included support for CCS. It said it saved $63.9m by abolishing the underwriting new energy generation program and committed the funding to energy storage technologies. The budget also revealed dramatically different priorities on water projects compared with the Coalition\u2019s last budget in March. Major projects championed by the Nationals to expand agriculture, including Hells Gate Dam, the Hughenden irrigation scheme in Queensland and the Dungowan and Wyangala dams in NSW, have been dumped or postponed. Instead the government has allocated $278m over five years for \u201cnationally significant transformational projects\u201d, such as securing Cairns\u2019 water supply. It said the Murray-Darling Basin Authority would get a boost of $51.9m over five years to update its understanding of climate change and its impacts on the basin.

Related: Coalmine approvals in Australia this year could add 150m tonnes of CO2 to atmosphere    Mullins, the Greens and independent MPs including Sophie Scamps are calling for more decisive action on global heating, including tearing up fossil fuel subsidies. The International Monetary Fund recently calculated fossil fuels cost the Australian budget $65bn a year \u2013 although most of the cost ($55.6bn) is indirect subsidies for failing to recoup the environmental and health costs from polluters. Earlier in September, the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, approved an expansion of the Gregory Crinum coalmine in central Queensland, which produces metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. Coalmine expansions and developments approved in Australia so far this year are expected to add nearly 150m tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere over their lifetimes. Climate scientists and bushfire experts have warned the country faces an elevated risk of bushfires this spring and summer compared with the past three wet years, with a predicted El Ni\u00f1o likely to deliver drier and hotter conditions. Mullins said a degree of warming was \u201cbaked into the system \u2026 until 2050\u201d but what happened after was \u201centirely reliant\u201d on what the government does to reduce emissions today.

Which is not what Hazel had hoped for Taylor. He was taught at his local primary school, which tried hard to include him.

But at the end of 2021, after almost two years of persevering, Hazel opted to pull Taylor out of his local high school. Despite many meetings and much effort to get Taylor out of special education and into mainstream classes, Hazel felt the school was unwilling to work towards the \u201cbig systemic changes\u201d required to make it truly inclusive. \u201cI wanted him to have a regular experience just like every other kid does,\u201d Hazel said. \u201cUnfortunately, none of that has worked out to be.\u201d Queensland\u2019s education minister, Grace Grace, said the government was committed to giving families a choice between sending eligible children to a special school or their local state school. \u201cIn fact, the overwhelming majority of children with disability in Queensland \u2013 95% \u2013 attend their local state school,\u201d Grace said. \u201cStarting in January 2023 Queensland will be transitioning to a game-changing new disability resourcing model, providing dedicated resources and support to a further 30,000 students with disability.\u201d", "\u2018Slap in the face\u2019: unions demand higher wages for Queensland public servants as inflation bites [2022-06-16T17:30:02Z]": "Queensland unions are calling for pay increases for public sector workers ahead of the state budget next week, with one union claiming anything less than a 5.5% yearly increase would be a \u201cslap in the face\u201d. Inflation is expected to hit 7% by the end of this year but public sector workers across the state have been receiving annual wage increases of 2.5% for several years. As inflation bites, the Palaszczuk government \u2013 like other states \u2013 is under increasing pressure to boost stagnant public sector wages.

Historically, we\u2019ve provided wage increases that have been above cost of living.\u201d Peter Ong, state secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, said the union had proposed a 5.1% annual wage increase for public sector workers, which was not accepted by the state government. \u201c[The current annual increase is] not acceptable. And I\u2019ve told government that I\u2019m not prepared to take anything back to my members unless it has a four in it and an increase in superannuation at the very least,\u201d Ong said. Last week, the New South Wales government announced it would lift its wage-rise cap from 2.5% to 3%, which was criticised by unions as being too low. Public Service Association members went on strike across NSW after the announcement.    In Victoria, frustrated teachers have reportedly quit the Australian Education Union, accusing the union of delivering them a \u201cpay cut\u201d after they accepted a 2% annual pay rise over the next four years.

But despite the potential for a more than $20bn boost to the state\u2019s economy, neither major party says it has any plans to capitalise on record prices that have seen the value of coal exports more than double in the past year. In June, the Queensland Labor government announced a dramatic overhaul of mining royalties in the state by introducing three new trigger points based on skyrocketing coal prices.   Related: \u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019: experts say Queensland\u2019s windfall from coal royalties could set a precedent    Under the system, which has been subject to fierce criticism from the mining sector, companies are charged 20% when coal prices are $175-$225 a tonne, rising to 40% when the coal price exceeds $300 a tonne. It has prompted calls for NSW to follow suit. The state currently charges a flat rate of 6-8% based on what type of mining method is used, and Rod Campbell, an economist at progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said it was \u201cmadness\u201d for the state to not consider a higher tax burden. \u201cThis is absolute textbook economics on what you should be taxing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be taxing the things you want less of \u2013 fossil fuel production \u2013 and you should tax higher when profits are over and above a normal return to capital.\u201d The war in Ukraine has seen the global price for coal sit at record prices for months.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, national coal exports in 2020-21 were worth $39.2bn. In 2021-22 that had risen to $109.7bn. At the June budget, NSW revised up its expected intake from coal royalties by $3.8bn or about 52% over the four years to 2025-26 thanks to surging demand. But according to analysis by consultancy firm Climate Energy Finance, NSW could have recouped an extra $23bn in royalties this year if the treasurer, Matt Kean, had followed the Queensland government\u2019s lead in overhauling mining royalties. In an analysis published last month, the CEF director, Tim Buckley, estimated that based on the current thermal coal spot prices, NSW could be in a budget surplus in the next financial year. Calling it \u201ca massive missed opportunity for NSW taxpayers\u201d, he said the state was in a better position to benefit from soaring coal prices thanks to record thermal coal spot prices. \u201cWe\u2019re in a period where the world is being smashed by hyperinflation in fossil fuels and yet a small number of fossil fuel-exporting companies are making windfall gains on back of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe NSW budget deficit is around $11bn. They could wipe that out and still have [billions] to spend on communities that need to transition away from coalmining.\u201d While he conceded current prices were not likely to last long term, the ongoing war in Ukraine coupled with the likelihood that sanctions on Russia could continue well into the future meant higher global demand for thermal coal was unlikely to abate. \u201cNSW could stand to be huge beneficiaries from that, but instead we\u2019re seeing foreign multinationals being the main winner,\u201d he said. Currently neither side of politics has shown any appetite to follow Queensland. The Coalition has indicated it will not follow suit, and this week the opposition leader, Chris Minns, ruled out adopting the same policy if Labor forms government after the March election. \u201cWe\u2019re not proposing that as a policy response in NSW,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re already the highest taxing state of any jurisdiction in any part of the country \u2026 we need to make sure that we\u2019re not putting added burden on business or the economy at a fragile time.\u201d Queensland\u2019s new royalties scheme caught most pundits by surprise when the state\u2019s treasurer, Cameron Dick, announced it in his June budget. Amid record coal prices, he said, the \u201cprogressive royalty tiers\u201d would ensure \u201cpeople of Queensland also receive a fair share of those windfall proceeds\u201d.   Related: \u2018Very different place\u2019: new campaign over mining taxes \u2018unlikely\u2019 to succeed in Queensland    It quickly sparked backlash from the industry, and shortly after the Queensland budget was released, the Whitehaven Coal managing director, Paul Flynn, warned against NSW following suit even amid soaring profits. \u201cWe will be making sure that NSW government leading up to the election in March next year understands the critical role the resources sector plays in NSW,\u201d he said at the time. Whitehaven last month posted a record $2bn net profit for the 2021-22 financial year. The CEO of the NSW Minerals Council, Stephen Galilee, said increasing the current rate would hurt investment in the state. \u201cMining royalty payments in NSW are already at record levels, reflecting strong commodity prices,\u201d Galilee said. \u201cMining royalties are just one of many taxes paid by mining companies as well as corporate tax, payroll tax, land tax and many other fees, charges and levies, and coal royalty rates in NSW are already double those for other minerals. \u201cImposing a Queensland-style royalty increase in NSW would only deliver a short-term revenue gain, while inflicting great damage to the reputation of NSW as a place to invest.\u201d But the Greens upper house MP Sue Higginson called it a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for NSW, saying a higher royalty rate could be used to fund \u201cthe inevitable transition of coal jobs\u201d. \u201cThe clean-up costs for climate-induced disasters such as the March floods are being borne by the residents of NSW while corporate mining interests are making ridiculous profits off the back of a war in the Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u201cQueensland has shown that we can and should make fossil fuel corporations pay their fair share when it comes to profits made at the expense of everyday Australians. NSW should take advantage of this spike in fossil fuel profits to better prepare ourselves for the billions we will need as we go from one climate disaster to the next.\u201d", "Failure to protect nature is a bigger threat to humanity than inflation, Australian scientists warn [2023-05-12T15:00:57Z]": "Leading Australian scientists have accused the Albanese government of offering \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d funding to stop environmental decline, and warned that failing to protect nature would lead to \u201can existential threat greater than inflation\u201d. The Biodiversity Council, an independent research hub, said the limited funding for environment programs announced this week suggested that environment minister Tanya Plibersek\u2019s promised target of ending species extinctions in the country was \u201cstill hollow\u201d. The council applauded the government\u2019s promise of $121m over four years to create a natural Environment Protection Agency, but said the budget failed to provide the funding boost needed to protect and recover threatened species and ecosystems.

Prof Hugh Possingham, a co-chief councillor at the Biodiversity Council and Queensland\u2019s former chief scientist, said it was too early to judge the government\u2019s performance, but urgent action was needed. He said it would have major consequences for the economy, human health, agriculture and clean air and water if the country continued to run down its natural capital. \u201cUnderfunding the care of the environment is an existential threat far greater than inflation,\u201d he said.

Peer-reviewed studies have found 19 ecosystems are showing signs of collapse. Prof Brendan Wintle, an ecologist at the University of Melbourne and a Biodiversity Council member, estimated the country needed to boost spending on environment programs by about six times to prevent extinctions and halt other declines. \u201cFor just 10% of the stage-three tax cuts we could recover every one of Australia\u2019s almost 2,000 threatened species,\u201d he said. The environment budget included $262m for degraded national parks, $163m for the Australian Institute of Marine Science and $45m to restore important sites in Sydney Harbour. In response to the scientists, Plibersek said the government was investing a record amount into the environment, including $224.5m for a saving native species program and $231.5m to establish 10 new Indigenous protected areas.

Plibersek said protecting threatened species required action across government, including rewriting environmental laws and the introduction of an EPA and Environment Information Australia, a separate new body promised to improve knowledge about threatened species. Legislation has been promised later this year. The chief conservation officer with World Wildlife Fund Australia, Rachel Lowry, said those commitments were welcome but in reality there appeared to be little-to-no new money for on-ground conservation compared with previous budgets. She said the government had renewed the existing Natural Heritage Trust program, which did not increase the overall pool of funding and the national parks funding was a \u201ctrifling\u201d amount spread over four years and mostly earmarked for infrastructure upgrades. \u201cThere is nothing new for critical on-the-ground conservation efforts and certainly not the major increase that is needed to halt and reverse rapid biodiversity loss,\u201d Lowry said. First coalmine approval Plibersek drew criticism after indicating a new coalmine would receive federal approval for the first time since the Albanese government was elected a year ago. The proposed Isaac River mine development in central Queensland is relatively small, expected to yield up to 500,000 tonnes of coal a year for up to five years. It would produce metallurgical coal, used in steel-making, which is considered harder to immediately replace with clean alternatives than thermal coal, used in electricity generation.

When it comes to soaring energy prices, Labor is in a tight spot. During the election campaign, and in the months before, Anthony Albanese said Labor\u2019s powering Australia policy would lead to lower power prices. More renewables in the market would reduce household energy bills by $275 by 2025. Powering Australia was released in December 2021. Since that time, things have gone south for energy users around the world. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, sending the global energy market into a tailspin and triggering a sharp increase in oil, gas and coal prices.   Related: Jim Chalmers\u2019 first budget comes amid a darkening economic outlook. Here\u2019s what could go wrong    Closer to home, 10 years of policy uncertainty in the energy sector was creating havoc. Ageing coal generators were now so clapped out they were causing domestic supply disruptions, and the combination of global factors and local conditions increased wholesale prices. The outgoing Morrison government then chose to delay releasing an important electricity pricing update due in March until after the May election. When that information was finally released to the public on 26 May, we learned many energy consumers would be hit with double-digit increases in their power bills from July.

Reputex found if more renewables could be bolted into the grid through new high voltage transmission lines, then power prices would come down, because renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Nothing has actually changed to alter the fundamentals of this calculation. Renewables are still the cheapest source of energy, and if we look to the current international challenges, the faster we can execute this transition, the less vulnerable Australia will be to global supply shocks, and local generation disruptions. In terms of specifics, Reputex said if Labor was able to roll out its plan, average wholesale prices in the national electricity market would probably reduce by 18% from today\u2019s levels (today being December 2021) and by 26% by 2030. The estimate of the saving for residential customers was $50 a megawatt hour by 2025 and $69 by 2030. Annual electricity bills for average households were therefore projected to be $275 lower by 2025 (and $378 by 2030). The caveats in this work are obvious. These forecasts assume the transition rollout goes to plan. And the prices assessed are \u201ctoday\u2019s levels\u201d. The today of December 2021 is not only a different country to today of May 2022, it feels like a different planet. But fair cop. Labor did utilise the $275 figure front and centre in its election messaging, often without the Reputex caveats or hedging, so the Albanese government put itself on the hook politically for the specific figure. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, also managed to fluff an answer to a question about the price commitment at the National Press Club on Wednesday, which gave the opposition some joy when question time rolled around shortly afterwards. Chalmers was asked whether or not Australians would still see the $275 saving. He replied: \u201cYep, it\u2019s in the budget.\u201d Chalmers said later he\u2019d misheard the question. In politics you live and die by the aggressively simplified soundbite, and that Reputex number is currently sailing past Peter Dutton, beckoning like a political liferaft. Understanding this, and understanding (more pertinently) that a 50+% increase in energy prices will cripple many households and businesses, the government is now working up what some people characterise as a significant regulatory intervention covering both gas and electricity. After downplaying the need for prices caps or other serious interventions for several weeks, the public signalling from senior ministers began to change in the week before the budget, presumably reflecting the updated forecasts and advice from energy regulators. It was too late to land a preferred intervention in the budget, but I suspect we\u2019ll see what the government has in mind reasonably soon. In the interim, let\u2019s return to Dutton and his political liferaft. The Liberal leader hit the airwaves early on Wednesday morning as empathiser-in-chief. Having read Tuesday\u2019s budget, Dutton felt there were a lot of families \u201cwho really feel deceived this morning\u201d. Somewhere between his parliamentary office, the budget lock-up, the television and radio studios of the press gallery and his Canberra accommodation, Dutton detected shock across the Australian community. Shock, because people had heard the prime minister promise on 97 occasions that power prices would come down by $275. Now the same prime minister was telling them prices were set to increase by 56% over the next two years, and gas prices would be up by 40% \u2013 and Labor was doing nothing about this. Not content with casting Albanese as the Marie Antoinette of power prices, Dutton then noted the government was happy \u201cto fund all sorts of energy activists in this space to oppose new gas fields, for example, when one of the biggest decisions that the government could take is to bring more gas online, to try to increase that supply so that we can meet our international commitments, but also to provide that support domestically\u201d. This was stirring stuff. Gaslighting (excuse the pun) and walking humbly in the shoes of the betrayed. As I said a minute ago, Labor created a political rod for its own back with its price prediction, and soaring energy prices are a genuine problem for the new government to manage. But before things get totally hysterical over the next few days, with Dutton leading j\u2019accuse, let me tell you a story about betrayal. Betrayal is being part of a government that failed to disclose an electricity price increase to voters before the May election.   Related: \u2018Rewiring the nation\u2019: Albanese and Andrews governments to jointly fund renewable energy zones    Betrayal is occupying the highest office in the land for nine years and doing everything you possibly can to turn Australia\u2019s energy market into the rolling debacle we see today. Betrayal is knowing full well that fundamental things need to change and telling voters, election after election, that things can remain exactly as they are. Betrayal is making Australia\u2019s energy transition harder and more expensive than it needed to be. Betrayal is sitting on the government benches and doing two-fifths of bugger all to lower domestic gas prices. Betrayal is failing to think deeply about getting the right balance between earning export income on Australian resources and safeguarding domestic supply. Betrayal is playing politics, all hours of the day, all days of the week. So when you hear about betrayal over the coming days, take a moment to consider the whole picture.", "State governments forced to indemnify church bodies for child abuse due to insurance \u2018market failure\u2019 [2023-05-10T15:00:01Z]": "State governments are being forced to strike confidential deals granting taxpayer-funded indemnity to church bodies for child abuse after an inundation of survivors\u2019 claims led commercial insurers to abandon religious institutions in droves. In Queensland alone, the state government has now brokered temporary deals to offer indemnity for child abuse claims relating to 18 organisations providing out of home care and youth homelessness services, including Anglicare Southern Queensland and another four church or faith-based groups. The indemnity deals guarantee to pay out survivors on their behalf where institutions are financially unable to do so. The intervention has been forced by the sudden failure of the private insurance market to cover churches and other non-government organisations providing out of home care services and youth homelessness services over child abuse claims.   Related: Australia\u2019s child abuse redress scheme will be opened to prisoners in recognition of trauma\u2019s impact    Insurers largely abandoned the field after landmark reforms in 2021 removed the time limit that previously barred many survivors from seeking justice in the courts. The reforms led to a sharp increase in child abuse claims. Without insurance, state governments feared that church-affiliated and non-government bodies would cease providing critical out-of-home care and youth homelessness services. Governments like Queensland\u2019s are heavily reliant on non-government organisations to provide such services to vulnerable children. The indemnity deals in Queensland apply only to out-of-home care and youth homelessness services which are funded by the government. The deals are also temporary and are expected to cease in September.

The Blue Knot Foundation questioned whether such arrangements allowed church bodies to avoid accountability for decades of systemic failures to protect children from abuse. \u201cSurely this should be the moral, financial and legal responsibility of the institution under whose watch children were harmed?\u201d the foundation\u2019s president, Cathy Kezelman, said. \u201cArguably taxpayers would be concerned that their money is being used to enable a powerful institution to effectively abrogate its responsibilities.\u201d The precise nature of the deals are confidential and details of any payouts are kept secret. The existence of one agreement, between the Queensland government and Anglicare Southern Queensland, was revealed in correspondence from Linard to the federal Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown, who had queried the arrangements on behalf of a constituent. Linard responded that the agreement was \u201csubject to a confidentiality agreement\u201d, which was necessary to \u201cmanage broader public policy concerns about the extent to which governments are expected to intervene in circumstances of commercial market failure\u201d. But she wrote that the deals were necessary to ensure that critical support services for vulnerable children were not compromised. \u201cWithout [physical and sexual abuse] coverage many child protection and youth homelessness service providers would be exposed to uninsured claims,\u201d Linard replied. \u201cIf claims are made that providers are unable to meet they may be forced to shut down, which would severely affect service delivery to vulnerable children and families.\u201d The chief executive of Beyond Abuse, Steve Fisher, a survivor of child abuse, was shocked by the indemnity arrangements, questioning how church groups could claim they were unable to pay, given their extensive assets and global wealth. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get insurance, that\u2019s their problem,\u201d he said. \u201cUse some of the hundreds of millions that they\u2019ve got in the bank to pay these claims. \u201cIt sounds like they\u2019re basically holding the government to ransom by saying if you don\u2019t do it, then we\u2019ll have to close down.\u201d Kezelman said she was concerned by the secretive nature of the indemnity deals. \u201cThe royal commission showed us repeatedly the cost of secrecy and lack of transparency, as the harm inflicted was perpetrated in the dark,\u201d she said.

Scamps said both the federal and state governments \u201cmust do more to fix the major issue facing the Wakehurst Parkway, the recurring flooding that leads to its closure\u201d. \u201cIt is unacceptable that one of the major arterial roads leading to the northern beaches\u2019 only public hospital is closed multiple times every year due to flooding.\u201d The NSW roads minister, Natalie Ward, noted the state government had provided $18m to the Northern Beaches council for flood mitigation on the parkway. \u201cI am disappointed that since Dr Scamps [was elected] it has taken just one federal budget for people on the Northern Beaches to be forgotten by the new Labor government,\u201d she said. The budget slashed two grants programs announced by the Coalition in the March budget as part of a deal to secure Nationals support for net zero: $6.4bn was cut from the energy security and regional development plan and $1.8bn was cut from the regional accelerator program.

Tuesday\u2019s federal budget included a comprehensive flood package, which outlined a raft of new measures including providing two additional $1,000 Disaster Recovery Payments to residents in catastrophically impacted areas who have already claimed their initial payments. The government believes these two additional payments will cost $245m in coming months, and take its total spending on disaster payments as a result of the floods to $450m by July. The government will also spend $10m over four years on a program called Resilient Kids, designed to deliver mental health care and trauma education to primary and secondary students in the NSW northern rivers affected by recent floods.

One reason for this large anticipated spend is because the commonwealth pays up to 75% of the cost of public assets, such as rebuilding roads. In announcing the flood package, the emergency management minister, Bridget McKenzie, said \u201cwe are listening to communities and providing funding for support where it is needed most\u201d. \u201cThese budget initiatives will play a critical role in supporting disaster-impacted local communities and businesses to recover as quickly as possible and be better prepared for future events,\u201d McKenzie said.

Concerns about Youpla \u2013 previously known as the Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund (ACBF) \u2013 have been around for a very long time. The first complaint about its conduct emerged in 1992, its first year of operation. Over the years, the corporate regulator Asic, Fair Trading NSW and the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (Afca) have all investigated and taken action against the company, but it continued to operate. ACBF-Youpla targeted Indigenous people using marketing materials in the distinctive red, black and yellow colours of the Aboriginal flag, including stuffed toys and colouring books for children, turning up to community events, and by conducting door-to-door sales. It was only when ACBF\u2019s conduct was exposed at the 2018 banking royal commission that its licence to sell new products was withdrawn.

So far, 160 applications have been approved. The program has paid out $1.35m to 149 recipients to help families bury their loved ones, according to a treasury spokesperson. \u201cThe collapse of the Youpla funeral fund has had a massive emotional and financial impact on many First Nations people,\u201d the Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, says. \u201cWe are working hard on a longer term resolution to assist the other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians who were affected by Youpla\u2019s collapse.\u201d Consumer advocates say the resolution must include the option of a refund. The Save Sorry Business coalition says 83% of clients they surveyed want their money back. The coalition calculates that there are an estimated 30,000 current and former policyholders with total losses in the vicinity of $300m. \u201cWhen a product fails, Australia offers as part of our consumer laws the right for replacement or refund,\u201d says Save Sorry Business\u2019 Bettina Cooper, a financial counsellor. \u201cIf First Nations people harmed by the collapse of Youpla are not given the option of money back then that goes against the principles well established within consumer laws.\u201d Cooper says previous federal governments legitimised the company by authorising millions in automatic payments from welfare income via the Centrepay system.    What does somebody do with two funerals?  Bettina Cooper     Centrepay was established so people could set up automatic payments for essentials such as rent or food from their fortnightly welfare income. Cooper says ACBF-Youpla was the only funeral fund granted access to Centrepay, and this gave it the appearance of having the government\u2019s tick of approval.  She says refunds should be on the table, alongside the option of like-for-like products. Over the past 12 months, some people have already invested in other insurance products and funeral bonds. \u201cTo not provide money back as an option means that those people will be harmed,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, what does somebody do with two funerals?\u201d Daphne Naden believes the directors of the company and its founder, Ron Pattenden, who is believed to be in Vanuatu, need to be held responsible. \u201cWhen you go out to community, that\u2019s what people always ask \u2013 about him. What\u2019s going to happen to him? When is he going to be held accountable?\u201d A 2022 Guardian Australia investigation revealed that Pattenden collected more than $20m in tax-free income from the business through a complex web of offshore companies, over 10 years from 2010, and continued to make money from it even after he sold it to new operators. Asic is investigating whether former directors have breached the law.

The matter will be back in court in May. After a year of uncertainty, Cooper says people are desperate to hear some hopeful news. \u201cThe government needs to tell people what is happening, and the steps that they\u2019re taking towards an enduring resolution, so that First Nations people are not stressed or concerned but have a clear understanding of decisions being made on their behalf.\u201d", "Public ownership of power assets key to smooth shift to renewables, Queensland energy minister says [2022-10-16T16:30:40Z]": "Retaining control of its electricity assets has given Queensland an edge over other regions in coordinating and funding the race to decarbonise the economy, the state\u2019s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, says. Queensland last month unveiled a $62bn plan to rid its power grid of coal by 2036, replacing the generation with 25GW of large-scale wind and solar farms, new transmission lines and two giant pumped hydro plants for storage. With its dominant ownership position of electricity generation and distribution assets, the government has been able to offset the impact of higher energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.

De Brenni said public ownership of the energy system allowed the state to ensure new large-scale generation, transmission, and storage infrastructure could be built in time, potentially ahead of when ordinary market signals would allow.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  \u201cBecause Queenslanders chose to keep energy assets in public hands, we have unprecedented control to guide the transformation of our energy system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to deploy those natural advantages that Queensland has to make sure that at all times the lights stay on and power remains affordable.\u201d The introduction in June of three new tiers for mining royalties to bolster state coffers has also helped pay for the energy transition, de Brenni said. New South Wales, which has a similar mix of coal for domestic use and export in its economy, has so far resisted lifting its royalty rates to collect a higher share of the record profits being garnered by miners. Queensland\u2019s resources sector, which complained it wasn\u2019t consulted on the changes, has estimated the impost would collect an extra $15bn this financial year alone. \u201cQueenslanders have a right to be rewarded when their resources are attracting incredibly high profits on global markets,\u201d de Brenni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to utilise some of those coal royalties in terms of supporting our transition to renewable energy. So high coal royalties in Queensland equal cleaner energy in Queensland.\u201d Despite criticism from miners, de Brenni said \u201ccitizens the world over want to see more investment by governments into the transition\u201d. \u201cCitizens would welcome the deployment of those returns to addressing climate change.\u201d The transformation of the energy sector won\u2019t come cheap and will likely add costs to power bills across Australia in the near term to pay for new capacity and transmission. But the near zero cost of generating renewable energy should bring down power prices, analysts say.   Related: Queensland government pledges to end reliance on coal-fired power by 2035    Queensland has been the clean energy laggard among Australian states, with just under 20% of electricity generated last year sourced from renewables. Nationally, the average was almost one-third. The head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, said Queensland\u2019s ownership of electricity assets would ease coordination issues, although the state\u2019s vested interest might explain why its transition away from fossil fuels lagged most other states to date. \u201cFossil fuel resources are horribly undertaxed in Australia,\u201d Mountain said. \u201cThe Queensland government\u2019s policy to tax a \u2018bad\u2019 to fund a \u2018good\u2019 is excellent policy that other states should emulate.\u201d But Mountain did query the government\u2019s plan for pumped hydro, which includes spending $270m to advance the Borumba and Pioneer-Burdekin sites to supply as much as 7GW of storage. Pioneer-Burdekin alone would be 5GW, or 2.5 times the size of Snowy Hydro\u2019s 2.0 project, and the largest in the world. \u201cI think there is a reason that pumped hydro gets so little attention internationally,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the government\u2019s credit it is funding proper studies and no doubt Queenslanders will be seeking a good reason if [it] does commit huge capital\u201d to the projects, he said.", "Morning Mail: Chalmers\u2019 $4bn surplus, airlines face calls for compensation payouts, frog loss fears [2023-05-08T21:01:04Z]": "Morning everyone.

Peter Dutton is intent on exploiting it | Peter Lewis [2023-05-30T01:34:48Z]": "Of all the problems the Albanese government faces as it enters its second year, housing looms as the most wicked: both devilishly complex and capable of unleashing the nation\u2019s darker angels. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, seemingly flagged in his budget-in-reply that he intends to exploit the systems failure that is our housing market to drive an immigration panic, just as Australia reopens its labour market in earnest after the pandemic pause. Dutton will receive ballast from the dawning realisation, currently being tapped and refined by the Greens, that property has become a form of inherited privilege where the barriers of entry are too high \u2013 as are the rewards for those who make their way in.   Related: Guardian Essential poll: majority of Australians support rent freezes, migration cap amid housing crisis    The doomsday scenario for the government is that these groups unify, driving Australia into a cycle of nativist distrust anchored in the economic disenfranchisement of younger people. This week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll shows the scope of the challenge the government faces. No other issue is so sharply framed along generational lines.   Interactive   The failure in the housing market is so profound that it has become a blank canvas, the perfect score for a dog-whistle symphony. Already-high property prices continue to rise, delivering a massive dividend to older generations. Those currently with mortgages bear an unfair load of the battle to manage inflation while those who are renting are hit with a double whammy of higher rents and rising market entry-level prices. Social housing waiting lists \u2013 already way too long to be considered a queue (can you come back to us in a decade?) \u2013 continue to grow, while precious homes either lie fallow as crude units of capital growth or listed on Airbnb for a premium rate. A cash-strapped government can do nothing more than offer Band-Aid solutions for a structural problem that perversely sees those already in the market have their growing wealth subsidised by taxpayers while those in desperate need are told there is not enough to go around. In this context it is true that post-pandemic immigration increases, originally set by the Morrison government, will put greater pressure on those people currently locked out of the market, while continuing to grow the value of property for those already in.   Related: I bought my first home in Australia aged 26. How? A combination of privilege and inheritance | Nicole McKenzie    We\u2019ve seen this movie before \u2013 a cynical populist pitch to the right harnessing the totally legitimate concerns of those on the wrong side of the \u201cfree\u201d market. \u201cTurn back the boats\u201d was the heroic bait and switch perpetrated on the Australian public first by John Howard and later a conga line of pale imitations, from Tony Abbott all the way to Scott Morrison. It too tapped a genuine and justified backlash against global capital. In 2001 it was resentment at the impact of the global trade in labour that was sending what had once been good, stable jobs offshore. Research we were doing for the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union at the time suggested Australians wanted government to rebuild some economic walls: \u201cfair trade, not free trade\u201d as the former Labor senator Doug Cameron would chant. Howard no doubt had access to these insights too but chose a different tack: a series of performative and dehumanising turnbacks of desperate asylum seekers trapped in a global people-smuggling trade, an unsurprising consequence of people fleeing war and tyranny. This simultaneously weaponised discontent against globalisation while providing cover for the expansion of the business and skilled migration intakes and the ongoing reduction of tariffs. Now we have d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In a classic pincer move, ageing nativists and younger Greens can now both turn on the government, with the current battle to get its modest housing fund through the parliament a proxy for this fledgling alliance. The Greens amplify the despair of younger renters by pointing out a fund of this modesty in a system in this state of disrepair will barely touch the sides. Despite the housing Australia future fund model being their invention, the Coalition votes no because it\u2019s their default, and why would they spend money on poor people anyway? In the midst of this noise it is hardly surprising there is broad support for \u201cborder control\u201d measures like capping immigration until there is sufficient housing and further restrictions on foreign ownership.   Interactive   The Greens would recoil at being implicated in Dutton\u2019s shenanigans; indeed, their voters are less likely to respond to the nativist siren\u2019s song, but weaponising housing has stark consequences. Dutton has flagged his strategy, and running in parallel with his increasingly shrill anti-voice rhetoric, he is actively inviting Australians to turn in on themselves.   Related: What does Australia\u2019s median rent of $600 a week get you in each capital city?     Social cohesion requires nuance on how the left approaches housing. It shouldn\u2019t be about pulling punches but ensuring you land in the right place. Rather than fighting each other at the margins, progressives have the chance to lead a national risk mitigation effort based in genuine systemic reform. The good news is there are some new and transformative ideas ready to be tested, iterated and scaled. And when we put them to the public, there is an openness to most of them.    Interactive   There is strong support for placing limits to speculative accumulation, capping the number of properties people can hold, or at the very least, the number that they can receive taxpayer subsidies for owning. There are new land ownership models currently under development, such as the shared equity scheme being championed by serial social entrepreneur Evan Thornley. This would get landlords out of direct ownership of rental properties \u2013 where indivisible greed or incompetence affect tenants directly \u2013 in favour of pooled investment that helps more people into the market. There are also ambitious new ways of thinking about social housing, linking other service-delivery silos such as aged care, childcare and disability supports to create better and more cohesive communities. And there is the ongoing and necessary conversation about the tax concessions going to those already in the market, including a cold, hard calculation on how these billions could be better spent. Pointedly, if we are to address a looming intergenerational showdown, we may need to question why Australia is one of the few developed nation\u2019s that does not have an inheritance tax. Fun fact: Australia did have death duties until the 1970s when Joh Bjelke-Petersen dropped his to lure people north and other governments dropped theirs to stop the flight of capital. So we entrenched intergenerational privilege because we didn\u2019t want old people to go to Queensland! Of course, a \u201cdeath tax\u201d is far too dangerous for any sane politician to countenance right now knowing the backlash of fear and loathing it would provoke, and it will probably remain so until the alternative of maintaining the dysfunctional status quo becomes worse. But thanks to Dutton and his cynical modus operandi, that moment may be closer than we realise.

The partial indexation of funding revealed by the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, aims to help community services keep up with rising costs. The Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and Australian Services Union had both called for a 5.5% increase in payments to community organisations, as surging inflation puts services already under strain from high demand during Covid at risk.   Related: Federal budget: no tax break for low- and middle-income workers as economic outlook worsens     The union pointed to increases in the superannuation guarantee and minimum wage, and inflation tipped to peak at 7.75% as sources of pressure that could force some organisations to shut their doors or reduce services. In its pre-budget submission Acoss said \u201cmany organisations in the sector have seen real cuts to the value of their funding\u201d due to inconsistent indexation. Acoss warned that \u201cunfunded shortfalls seriously impact the sector\u2019s capacity to offer services to local communities, especially at a time of rising community demand and increased complexity of service user need\u201d. It called for the wage price index or consumer price index to be used \u201cas the primary index for annual funding adjustments\u201d.

The ASU welcomed the announcement, which assistant national secretary Emeline Gaske said \u201cgives the sector room to breathe after three years of providing services under the constraints of the pandemic with chronic underinvestment by the previous federal government also taking a toll\u201d. \u201cMost people in the community recognise that community services workers are over worked and underpaid and support government investment here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe past few months shows what is possible when the community\u2019s concerns are matched with a government that actually cares about workers and our most vulnerable.\u201d On Sunday the Albanese government also announced an extra $12.4m for parent-child playgroups and toy libraries, alongside a suite of measures designed to make paid parental leave easier to access. In total 180,000 families will benefit from Labor\u2019s commitment to increase paid parental leave from 18 weeks to 26 weeks by 2026. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, revealed that while legislating the reform the government will change the rules to allow either parent to be the primary claimant. Parents will also be able to take weeks of leave at the same time, so they can spend time at home together with their children. The PPL reform will allow non-birth parents to receive PPL even where the birth parent does not meet the newly arrived resident\u2019s waiting period, meaning a further 1,500 migrant families will benefit. Eligibility will be expanded through the introduction of a $350,000 family income test, which allows families to access paid parental leave if they exceed the individual income limit of $156,647. That measure will see about 2,200 high income earners added to the scheme. Rishworth said the government was \u201ccommitted to making a better Australia and leaving no one behind\u201d. \u201cOur PPL changes will make it easier for families to share care by removing the current requirement that the primary claimant must be the birth parent,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will make it easier for partners to take leave and remove assumptions about mothers and fathers being \u2018primary\u2019 or \u2018secondary\u2019 carers.\u201d", "Government urged to reject plan to release CSG wastewater near \u2018bum-breathing\u2019 turtle\u2019s Queensland habitat [2022-10-11T16:30:09Z]": "Campaigners are calling on the federal government to stop Santos from releasing untreated coal seam gas wastewater into a Queensland river that provides critical habitat to two species of threatened \u201cbum-breathing\u201d turtles. The oil and gas company has approval to dig an additional 6,100 gas wells near Roma, in the state\u2019s south west.

The research, from two leading scientists who contributed to the UN climate panel\u2019s assessment of how quickly global emissions will need to drop, points to how far Australia has to go to legitimately claim its targets are in line with the 1.5C goal.

While Australia has a net zero target by 2050, Meinshausen and Nicholls say this net zero date should be 2038 based on Australia\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d of effort. Nicholls said: \u201cWe are at the point where we need to be going for maximum possible ambition.

The new analysis gives Australia a 0.97% share of that global budget, a figure taken from a 2014 Climate Change Authority report that sees developed countries making faster cuts to allow developing countries more time to decarbonise. That 0.97% share is considered generous, the authors said, because Australia makes up only 0.33% of the planet\u2019s population. According to Climate Resource, the government\u2019s current plans would lead to 7.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent being released by Australia between 2021 and 2050, which was \u201croughly double\u201d a budget of 4bn tonnes \u201cfor a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C.\u201d Prof Frank Jotzo, a climate policy expert at Australian National University, said it was \u201cimpossible to pin down\u201d what the \u201cfair share\u201d of any country\u2019s efforts on emissions reductions would look like \u201cbecause there are so many value judgments that need to be made\u201d. But he said to pass any \u201cplausibility test\u201d for a 1.5C-aligned commitment, emissions reductions would need to be \u201cextremely rapid, deep and sustained\u201d and Australia\u2019s current policy ambition was \u201cnot in line with 1.5C\u201d. Keeping global temperatures close to 1.5C would reduce the impacts of heatwaves, sea level rise, temperature extremes and give ecosystems such as Queensland\u2019s Great Barrier Reef a better chance of avoiding collapse. The government will set its 2035 target in 2025 after the Climate Change Authority issues advice in 2024. The authority is in the middle of a community consultation process on that issue. Last month, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, wrote to Unesco to promote the federal and Queensland government\u2019s steps to conserve the reef after a UN-backed monitoring mission called for a series of new measures.

But the broader picture is of making very clear to the public that the relatively rosy views of the economy made in March have been mugged by reality, and tough times are ahead. The March budget had inflation growth of 3.5%; now it is 6.1% with tomorrow\u2019s figures expected to be well above 7%. In March the cash rate was at the still pandemic emergency level of 0.1%; now it is 2.6%. Back then the Reserve Bank was predicting the economy in 2022 would grow by 4.25% and next year to slow to 2%; now it only expects GDP growth this year of 3.2% and next year to grow a very tepid 1.8%.   Related: Jim Chalmers\u2019 first budget comes amid a darkening economic outlook. Here\u2019s what could go wrong    Things have changed and, to be honest, whoever had won in May would have needed to redo the budget. This was predicted at the time. The March budget was designed purely to get the Coalition to the election and nothing further. So, what does the redo give us? Well, the main economic message is enjoy today because tomorrow is going to be bad, and there is a good chance it will be even worse than we hope. The budget papers expect a sharp slowing of the economy in the next two years. This very much echoes the latest estimates by the IMF. And, if we are blunt, there is a strong risk of a recession. It is rare for Australia\u2019s economy to grow by less than 2% in any 12-month period. The budget now predicts the 2023-24 year will see just 1.5% growth. That would be the slowest growth outside of the pandemic year since the 1990s recession:       If the graph does not display click here Even worse, as the budget papers note, is that the risks are very much heightened. The Treasury predicts the major global economies won\u2019t go into a recession but, if they do, that 1.5% growth becomes a mere 0.75%. Growth that weak over an entire 12 months would almost guarantee a recession, however you wish to measure it. There are also risks for this year. Households are now the big drivers of the economy, with consumption in 2022-23 expected to grow by 6.5%. That would be the biggest growth since the Beatles toured in 1963-64. That might happen because, as Treasury notes, we are beginning to start spending on services we were unable to use during the pandemic and amid border closures. But still it\u2019s a big jump, especially at a time when inflation is rising and the risk remains that people might be spooked into not spending because they are worried about rising prices. Inflation has not been all bad for the budget, though. The rise of commodity prices including oil and gas is the big reason the budget bottom line is looking better than it was in March. Since the 2020-21 budget, which was drawn up when the pandemic was most dire, revenue projections have increased dramatically:       If the graph does not display click here The budget is now looking rather better than it was just six months ago \u2026 at least for this year. The budget deficit for this financial year has gone from the deficit predicted in March of $77.9bn (3.4% of GDP) to $36.9bn (1.5% of GDP). But the big boost in commodity prices is not expected to last and the deficit in 2023-24 is expected to increase to 1.8% of GDP. This is better than was expected in March, but highlights just how big of a windfall the oil and gas prices rises have been for resource companies this year. The March budget predicted $92.2bn in company tax this year; now Treasury expects $127.3bn. Even with an increase in spending due to inflation raising the indexation of payments such as the aged pension and jobseeker above what was expected, that means a nice reduction in the deficit. But it is really a one-off. In 2024-25 and 2025-26 the budget expects larger deficits than were predicted in March:       If the graph does not display click here While the government\u2019s budget might be better for the next two years, people\u2019s own budgets are rather more fraught. A slowing economy means higher unemployment (the budget predicts that will rise to 4.5%) and usually worse wages growth. The past decade has really been a bad one for wages predictions. Strong growth is always about to occur, and then reality comes along and laughs at the budget:       If the graph does not display click here The Treasury now predicts wages growth will be 3.75% by June and stay there until at least June 2024. When we line that up with slowing growth and rising unemployment it suggests some pretty extraordinary happenings. Usually, wage growth slows when unemployment rises. Over the past six years, however, unemployment rates that would have once seen wages growing at more than 4% are now struggling to get above 3%. Each budget suggests this relationship will change back to the old ways, and each year it does not happen. Once again the budget hopes this will happen. Maybe the changes to industrial relations that will see multi-employer bargaining and a reduction in the terminations of enterprise agreements during the bargaining process will enable wages to grow. But I\u2019d wait before banking that extra money:       If the graph does not display click here We also need to consider what is happening with inflation. The budget estimates a peak of 7.75% inflation growth by the end of this year and slowing to 5.75% by June. This means that real wages are expected to fall:       If the graph does not display click here If the budget figures come true, real wages in June next year will be 5% below what they were in June 2019 and, by June 2026, they will still be some 3.2% below pre-pandemic levels. That is a historic smashing of living standards. And it also highlights the savage impact of the removal of the low-middle income tax offset. The LMTIO was increased and extended in the March budget from a maximum of $1,020 to $1,500 for those earning between $48,000 and $90,000. Neither party committed to extending the offset during the election, which meant both the ALP and LNP went to an election committed to a 3.1% tax rise for people on $48,000. That stage-three tax cut of course remains, and it means only those earning more than $97,000 will be better off after those tax cuts have come in than they were in June this year. The budget reveals the major risk and rough waters ahead but also the massive amount of work still to be done to undo the damage of the past decade.", "Labor\u2019s changes to gas tax will deliver little if any extra revenue, analysts say [2023-05-08T08:28:20Z]": "Australia\u2019s changes to its tax on big gas exporters will deliver little if any additional revenue, analysts say, with any benefits in the short term coming at the expense of future budgets.

The Greens claim the threat was discussed but was not a primary driver of the decision. \nThe Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the party room was \u201cbroadly\u201d on the same page throughout negotiations on the Haff and in the end \u201cunanimously agreed\u201d to the deal with a total of $3bn of direct spending. \nGreens targets revealed \nBefore the bill had even passed, the Greens were threatening other government bills and drawing up a plan to take their campaign for rent caps or a freeze to the next election. \nAll signs are that although the Greens have lost the battle for rent caps, the war for the votes of the one in three Australians who rent is just beginning. \nIn a speech to the Victorian Greens conference on Sunday, Bandt will cite target seats including Macnamara, Higgins, Wills and Cooper in Melbourne; Tanya Plibersek\u2019s seat of Sydney, where 52% of voters rent; and Richmond, in the northern rivers of New South Wales. \nChandler-Mather adds Moreton and Lilley in Brisbane, where the Greens were able to pick up three seats at the 2022 election. \nChandler-Mather has no intention of demobilising the campaign as he pursues the \u201ctransformation of the Greens into a full-blown not just renters\u2019 party but also an organising party\u201d. \n \n  Related: Greens vow to \u2018keep fighting\u2019 on housing as party takes aim at Labor\u2019s help-to-buy scheme  \n \nHe says the party is growing in the lower income brackets and \u201cthere are more renters voting for us than ever before\u201d, which he labels \u201ca natural evolution\u201d. \nBandt makes no apology for the fact all the targets are held by Labor. \u201cOur primary \u2026 electoral aim is to grow and to bring about real change for renters,\u201d he says. \n\u201cLabor is choosing to be the country\u2019s centre-right party \u2026 and we\u2019re offering a genuine social democratic alternative.\u201d \nPolling evidence that the Greens are on the march is mixed. In the Newspoll they sit at a primary vote of 13%, which is about what they polled at and before the 2022 election. The Guardian Essential poll has them at 15%, which is higher than the 10% they recorded before the 2022 election. \nA \u2018tsunami\u2019 is coming: pollster \nThe director of pollster RedBridge Group Australia, Kos Samaras, thinks the Greens are \u201cgoing to win the war\u201d for renters\u2019 and young people\u2019s votes. \n\u201cThose under 40 particularly those in their 20s have been looking for a third way in Australian politics. What previously prevented them from supporting the Greens is that they seemed to be a single issue party. \n\u201cSince the election the Greens have focused ruthlessly on housing and the economy in general.\u201d \nThis appeals to zoomers and millennials who feel the economic system is \u201cgamed against them\u201d, he says. \nRedBridge has the Greens\u2019 primary vote at 13%, but higher in the 18 to 34 age bracket (28%), and particularly concentrated in parts of inner-city Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. Its most recent poll even found the Greens outpolling Labor and the Coalition among that age group in Queensland. \n\u201cWe won\u2019t see the full impact for another couple of cycles, but with 450,000 to 500,000 young people enrolling every term a tsunami is coming,\u201d Samaras says. \n \n  Related: Essential poll: three in four Australians say rents should be capped to inflation or frozen until economy improves  \n \nAlthough Labor points to studies that price controls have a harmful effect on supply and argues that rental law is up to the states, the Guardian Essential poll finds the Greens\u2019 policies on rents are popular. \nMore than three quarters of voters believe rents should either be frozen (34%) or capped at the rate of inflation (44%). That dwarfs support for the solution national cabinet adopted of limiting increases to once a year (11%). \nBut still, Essential detected no significant changes in the Labor or Greens vote over the past six months among renters. \nChandler-Mather says although the Greens weren\u2019t able to win a rent freeze or cap this time, by recruiting hundreds of organisers and volunteers the party now has a \u201cplatform upon which we build our fight\u201d. \n\u201cNine months ago, no, one even knew what a rent freeze was and now the majority of the country supports it,\u201d he says. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been clear over these last nine months that you can mobilise people to act in their own material interests.\u201d \n \n  Related: Have the Greens lost the fight for renters\u2019 rights? \u2013 podcast  \n \nWhile Chandler-Mather was building the campaign, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was using the bully pulpit of the prime ministership to counter-punch hard. \nAlbanese accused the Greens of \u201chypocrisy\u201d at Labor\u2019s conference for blocking the Haff while opposing housing developments. He targeted Chandler-Mather in question time quoting at length from an article the first term MP wrote for Jacobin arguing that \u201cparliamentary conflict helps create the space for a broader campaign in civil society\u201d and that passing the bill would \u201cdemobilise\u201d the campaign. \nAlbanese said the essay \u201cexposed\u201d that for the Greens \u201cit\u2019s all about the campaign, not about the substance\u201d. \nBut to Chandler-Mather the campaign had a real, material aim: to \u201cfundamentally change the property relations in this country in favour of renters\u201d. He insists the results speak for themselves. \n\u201cI do not think we would have won $3bn [in total] for public and community housing, if there weren\u2019t hundreds of people across these country knocking on doors going to rallies and building this campaign.\u201d \nRent caps only make it worse: Burns \nOne of the MPs in the Greens\u2019 sights is Josh Burns, the member for Macnamara, an electorate where more than half (51.5%) of people rent, well above the Victorian and national average. \nBurns says he is \u201cnot focused on the Greens\u2019 megaphone diplomacy and trying to win political fights on social media\u201d. \n\u201cI care about being part of a government that can get things done, including investing billions in social housing. \n\u201cPeople on our side want to build social housing because we believe in it \u2013 not to be reactionary to the Greens.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nBurns explains rent caps may \u201csound good\u201d as a policy but \u201cmy nervousness with it is in two years there is less investment in the rental sector and the problem is made worse\u201d. The policy could also drive more landlords towards \u201clucrative\u201d short-stay leasing, such as Airbnb. \n\u201cSome people are genuinely facing financial hardship, that is real \u2013 and we\u2019re doing a number of things to help those people. \n\u201cBut in the long term if we have a supply issue, restricting investment in the rental sector is only going to make it worse.\u201d \nThe housing minister, Julie Collins, used the passage of the Housing Australia Future Fund bill on Thursday to remind Australians of the total suite of Labor policies. \nThese include the $10bn fund that will spend at least $500m of its earnings to build 30,000 social and affordable homes; $3bn of direct spending on public, social and affordable housing; and a further $3bn to incentivise the states to build more houses. \nIn the May budget, Labor increased the maximum rate of commonwealth rent assistance by 15%. \n \n  Related: Rental vacancy rate plummets to record low as Australia\u2019s housing crisis deepens  \n \n\u201cThis has never been about the people in this place [parliament],\u201d Collins said on Monday. \u201cThis is about people like [the ones] I\u2019ve met who have been on social housing waiting lists for a long time. \n\u201cPeople like Lauree, [who\u2019s] been homeless for more than a year on the north-west coast of Tasmania, who said getting a home means that she can now go back to school.\u201d \nOn Wednesday, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, boasted the Haff was \u201cthe single biggest investment in social housing\u201d since Plibersek was housing minister over a decade ago. \nChampioning a cause \nBut Samaras warns that the Greens\u2019 appeal is \u201cnot so much specific policies\u201d like a rent cap as it is \u201cchampioning [young voters\u2019] cause\u201d. \n\u201cMax Chandler-Mather is bang on about renters\u2019 rights. When we ask voters who is strongest in fighting for housing, they say the Greens. \n\u201cOn rent caps, they think they won\u2019t necessarily fix the problem, they say the problem is too big or landlords will take it out on them. \n\u201cBut they need a champion. They say \u2018at least they [the Greens] are fighting for it\u2019.\u201d \nLabor\u2019s thinking is that the Greens struggle to balance the demands of their activist base and middle-of-the-road voters, who may respect them for bargaining hard but don\u2019t want them to be blockers. \nThe Greens say they are willing to push again, and have already identified Labor\u2019s help-to-buy shared equity scheme as another pinch point in parliament. \nOn Friday Bandt noted that Labor needs his party\u2019s support for tax legislation as well, implying the petroleum resource rent tax changes could be another bargaining chip or flashpoint. \nWill the Haff fight repeat next year over the help-to-buy scheme designed to help 10,000 homebuyers a year? Chandler-Mather says: \u201cWell, I think that [is] the question for Labor \u2026 what we\u2019ve proven is that we are willing to do that.\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t apologise for that. Our job in parliament isn\u2019t to be Labor left, to roll over when you get your tummy tickled by the prime minister. Our job here is to fight for the people who often get locked out of politics.\u201d \nWhether that\u2019s bluster in a week the Greens did precisely that or a statement of intent that will resonate with voters remains to be seen.", "Morning mail: fossil fuels out of renewable fund, Ukraine plans trial for Russian leaders, news fatigue [2022-07-21T21:12:29Z]": "Good morning.

The obvious source, already flagged by the treasurer, Cameron Dick, is an increase in royalty rates for coal. \nThese rates, set on a sliding scale according to the price of coal, have been frozen for the last 10 years, as promised by the Newman LNP government after a small increase in 2012. With the 10-year freeze now expired, resources groups are lobbying intensely for no changes to the existing regime. But there is a logical case for increasing royalties on coal, which is currently trading at spectacularly high prices. \nFor most commodities, the high prices we are now observing would be a signal of favourable prospects. For coal, it\u2019s the opposite. World coal consumption peaked in 2014, and is predicted to decline steadily over the next decade. Many countries have already ended the use of coal to generate electricity, or will do so in the next few years. Metallurgical coal, used in making steel, will last a bit longer. But the coal-based blast furnace technology is already facing the prospect of replacement by coal-free techniques using renewable hydrogen. \n \n  Related: Wallabies, coal and a town called Dingo: the battle over a Queensland mine proposal  \n \nWhile coal demand has flattened out, new investment in coalmines has dropped far more rapidly. Investors can see that there is no long-term future in coal. Witness BHP\u2019s inability to sell its Mt Arthur coal mine, which it announced on Thursday would close in 2030. Meanwhile, global financial institutions have abandoned the industry, pledging not to finance or support new coalmine projects.  \nIn these circumstances, there is only limited supply response available to meet temporary increases in demand, like those arising from the strong economic recovery after Covid, followed by sanctions imposed on Russia. The result is the sharp increase in prices we have seen recently. \nCoal is on the way out, but a good deal of money can be made in the meantime, while high prices last. Most major corporations, with a long-term future in mind, have abandoned the industry. Those that remain need to reap profits fast, which is why they are more determined than ever to resist any increase in taxation. \nBut the same analysis applies to royalties, the price paid by miners to the public as owners of the coal resource. Usually there is a trade-off in setting royalty rates, between maximising revenue while protecting the long-term future of the industry. However, this no longer applies. Investment in new coalmines is in long-term decline, whether or not royalty rates are increased. \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nQueensland\u2019s focus must be on gaining additional revenue while export demand remains strong and using it to transform our energy system. The transition to a carbon-free energy system will require big capital expenditures. In particular, public investment in carbon-free energy through CleanCo needs to be greatly expanded. \nAs well as decarbonising our own electricity grid, the government needs to plan for the future of regions which currently rely on coal exports as a major source of employment.

The aid sector warmly welcomed the budget boost, which starts slowly and will be concentrated on the Pacific, but urged the government to rebuild Australia\u2019s standing by going further in next year\u2019s budget. Rev Tim Costello, the executive director of Micah Australia, said he was relieved that the government had started to change \u201cthe narrative that aid is just an ATM for us to go to whenever there\u2019s a domestic top-up that\u2019s needed\u201d. But he noted the new aid budget \u2013 $4.65bn in 2022-23, up about $100m from last year \u2013 was \u201cstill very low\u201d by international standards.   Related: Mathias Cormann calls for greater foreign aid despite role in Australian cuts    The chief executive of Oxfam Australia, Lyn Morgain, said the aid budget remained stubbornly low after \u201cyears of cuts and neglect\u201d, adding: \u201cWe can and must do better.\u201d Australia\u2019s official development assistance (ODA) had been likely to fall under the Coalition to be worth only about 0.18% of gross national income, but the level will now be \u201cstabilised\u201d at 0.2% for each of the next four years. Australia has slipped from its status as the ninth most generous donor in the OECD about 25 years ago. By last year, Australia had fallen down the list to be ranked 21st out of 29 donor countries, according to an aid tracker published by the Australian National University\u2019s Development Policy Centre. Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden are the top of the pack, spending more than 0.9% of their national incomes on aid, while the UK also remains well ahead of Australia, allocating about 0.5%.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Analysts believe Australia is likely to remain in a similar position at the bottom of the pack of OECD rankings even after the new figure of 0.2% is taken into account. Countries that are just above Australia in the rankings \u2013 New Zealand and Spain \u2013 allocated 0.28% and 0.25% of national income last year. Labor\u2019s national platform committed the party to \u201crebuild Australia\u2019s international development program\u201d to be worth at least 0.5% of gross national income, but it did not set a deadline. Instead, the party said it would \u201cincrease aid as a percentage of gross national income every year that we are in office, starting with our first budget\u201d. Costello said to reach the 0.5% target the government would have to keep making the case that increasing ODA funding was both the right thing to do morally but also served Australia\u2019s national interest. Australia is campaigning for a seat on the UN security council in 2029-30. Costello said he did not have \u201cany moral objection if aid also serves the purpose of Australia getting a seat on the security council\u201d. \u201cOften Australians say, \u2018yes, but we\u2019re in pain, we\u2019ve got to look after ourselves,\u2019 as if the Brits aren\u2019t in pain \u2013 and they\u2019re giving two-and-a-half times more to the world\u2019s poor than we are.\u201d The $1.4bn in additional foreign aid will be mostly directed to the Pacific ($900m over four years) and south-east Asia ($470m) and comes as the government works on a broader review of the development program. The Pacific figure is much higher than the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, promised in the election campaign. Marc Purcell, the chief executive of the Australian Council for International Development, said it was significant that Wong had persuaded her colleagues on the cabinet\u2019s expenditure review committee to agree to top up the election commitment. Purcell said Pacific countries had been \u201cbellywhacked by Covid\u201d but the previous Coalition government had rolled out \u201ctemporary\u201d measures for the region.   Related: Labor pledges extra $200m in Australian aid for Ukraine and $500m for veterans in budget    \u201cThis budget actually makes what was temporary permanent and that\u2019s very significant because our relationships with our neighbours in the Pacific are permanent,\u201d Purcell said. \u201cAustralia is actually better positioned now to do more in our region.\u201d Purcell said he \u201choped and expected\u201d that the government would go further next year. Unicef has vowed to work with the government to \u201cbuild the case for greater investment in our region in coming months and years\u201d. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Australia would strengthen the Pacific\u2019s climate resilience and address a decade\u2019s worth of development gains lost due to the pandemic. Other areas of focus include health, water, sanitation, hygiene, education, social protection systems, gender equality and disability inclusion. The government has reintroduced a target that development investments above $3m must include a gender equality objective. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said the budget increase would \u201cadvance Australia\u2019s interests by tackling poverty and supporting stability, prosperity and security in our region\u201d.", "\u2018Plucked from the sky\u2019: Queensland government questions funding for Sunshine Coast rail project [2022-03-28T16:31:00Z]": "Queensland\u2019s transport minister has described the budget eve announcement of a train line from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast as being in \u201ccircus sort of territory\u201d, saying the promised money appeared \u201cplucked out of the sky\u201d.

But the treasurer expressed \u201ca bit of surprise\u201d at the dollar figure attached to the Sunshine Coast rail extension. Queensland would be expected to match Canberra\u2019s $1.6b, but Dick said his government had been advised the project would cost more. \u201cThey think they can deliver the project for $3.2b \u2013 that\u2019s not the advice we received,\u201d the treasurer said.

Federal urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, said in a statement that track upgrades between Kuraby to Beenleigh would allow for the doubling of express and all stop services to the Gold Coast. Coupled with the track extension from Beerwah to Maroochydore, the two projects would \u201cenhance connectivity\u201d between the capital and major regional centres to the north and south, forming part of a 200km north-south rail corridor, \u201cwith Brisbane at the centre\u201d. \u201cWith the 2032 Olympic Games just a decade away, it is critical that we plan and invest in the required infrastructure now so that Queensland is not only well equipped to host a successful Games, but can support sustainable growth over the coming decades,\u201d Fletcher said.

Ahead of confirming funding on Friday for 34 new mitigation projects to reduce the impact of coastal erosion accelerated by the climate crisis, Watt used an insurance industry conference to put the sector on notice.

To illustrate the point, Watt cited the effect of mitigation work done in Roma in western Queensland, noting \u201cbefore 2015, if anyone so much as spat upstream of the town it would flood, with homes facing more regular inundation with premiums that rose with every event\u201d. \u201cBut the construction of a $15m flood levee, which protected 483 homes and 75 businesses, reduced insurance premiums by an average of 34%\u201d.

At current prices, coking coal was selling for about $US370 (AU$537) a tonne, less than the going price of thermal coal at $US390 (AU$566). \u201c[We] estimate that coal royalty payments to the Queensland government will increase from $6bn to $12bn in the second half of this year as a result of the increase in royalty rates,\u201d Simington said.  \u201cIf hard coking coal declines to $US230 (AU$333) and thermal to $US150 (AU$217), the additional royalty would only be about $1bn.

Morrison wrote to Palaszczuk on Tuesday night rejecting the request. He said in his letter that the measures were \u201coutside the scope\u201d of federal disaster recovery programs and the responsibility of state and local governments.

Almost 80 years later, \u201cprefabs\u201d have been renamed and are back in play, after the New South Wales government committed $10m in the state budget to a trial of whether modular housing could \u201cdeliver faster quality social housing\u201d. It will be spent on assessing planning pathways, identifying how to build to the highest standards, and scouting potential suppliers and locations.    Prefabricated construction represents about 3% of Australia\u2019s building industry, but its reputation as a cheap and nasty housing option is beginning to be challenged by sustainable, design-led and compact, yet expansive models.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Modular housing has been promoted both as a short-term measure to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters and a quick way to provide permanent family homes to help address Australia\u2019s housing crisis.  Modular construction comes in several forms. It can be delivered \u201cas a box\u201d in finished form, as a flat pack \u2013 separate parts such as wall frames and floor panels \u2013 or as a kit of smaller components.    Ashley Beaumont, the founder and director of the modular housing company EcoLiv, says the decision to fund modular housing is a promising step forward, although only one part of a much bigger picture.  \u201cIts cost-efficiency and faster construction make it a viable option to rapidly increase housing supply,\u201d Beaumont says. \u201cHowever, while it\u2019s a step in the right direction, we should also consider other critical factors like land availability, infrastructure and urban planning to ensure a comprehensive solution.\u201d EcoLiv\u2019s homes use sustainable materials, producing custom-built or pre-designed module homes with a minimum seven-star energy rating, which can be completed in about 20 weeks. Prices begin at about $500,000 for a two-bedroom, two-module home, rising to about $650,000 for a three-bedroom, three-module home. They are customisable and aim to reduce ongoing running costs by as much as 30% as a result of passive solar design.  With growing demand, Beaumont hopes that government involvement will create more opportunities for collaboration and growth, particularly in social housing, where he says regulation and a resistance to change in the construction industry can often stand in the way. Modular housing has been used recently as a quick solution for flood relief in the Northern Rivers of NSW and in central west towns such as Eugowra, but in some cases disaster relief programs have been marred by a lack of community consultation, small funding pools for buyback initiatives and inefficient rollouts. Peter Maddison, architect and director of Maddison Architects and former host of Grand Designs Australia, says modular housing may not be the silver bullet, but it has its place.    \u201cIf modular housing was the saviour for our current housing crisis, it\u2019d be everywhere, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d, Maddison says. \u201cPeople will go for the easiest way through the mire of owning a home.\u201d Its great benefit is the low cost and the speed at which a house can be built. \u201cAffordability is about size and the predictability of outcome,\u201d Maddison says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re building remote from the site, you\u2019re not affected by the vagaries of weather and you can work 12 hours a day on it.\u201d But building modular homes quickly does not always mean they can be installed immediately. \u201cIn terms of allowing permanent places to be built when they appear overnight or in someone\u2019s back yard \u2026 councils are not sure how to deal with these lightweight deliverable homes that are done quickly,\u201d says Maddison. \u201cSo there\u2019s there\u2019s certain hoops you got to jump through to build a home, and that time could be 12 months.\u201d \u2018Time and cost efficiencies \u2013 with design excellence\u2019 It was almost 10 years ago when Grand Designs planted the speed and affordability of kit homes in the minds of architecture enthusiasts with the Huf Haus. It proved that while replication keeps costs down, design constraints don\u2019t have to result in cookie cutter housing.    Numerous companies have now turned that idea into an adaptable range of modular housing options aimed at giving homeowners more choice and control, whether on a large rural property, or using stackable modules in the city. In the Victorian coastal town of Barwon Heads, John O\u2019Donnell says building his modular home was a precise and seamless experience. \u201cIt was great, because it meant what they said it would cost was exactly what it cost, as opposed to building your own house, where there always seems to be vast numbers of things that go wrong,\u201d he says. Using a customisable design from Arkular, he created a five-bedroom house using two main modules and a joining module which acts as a corridor. O\u2019Donnell has added a garage and water tanks, and has plans to install solar panels on site. With these additions and other work, it cost about $700,000.    \u201cI\u2019ve been through house building before \u2026 and like most people found it not a very pleasant experience,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cYou get there in the end, but it takes a long time. And this did not. I could pop out there and just watch it being built in front of my eyes.\u201d Arkular offers customisable or pre-configured designs from one bedroom to four, which can be built in 12 to 20 weeks, and is only one of numerous companies now offering modular options. Wild Modular, showcasing some innovative designs, was enlisted by the NSW government in 2022 to produce homes for flood-affected Lismore. Prefabulous has a suite of multi or single module designs for \u201ccoastal\u201d, \u201crural\u201d or \u201chinterland\u201d settings and has recently received government funding to produce a net zero modular housing model in collaboration with the University of Wollongong. And FabPreFab champions timber-led modular design, two of which received commendations in the 2021 House Awards. This year Blok Modular and the architects Vokes and Peters won the same award for the best new house under 200 sq m for their Stafford Heights project.   Related: Tiny homes have existed \u2018under the radar\u2019. But changing rules are making the lifestyle more permanent    Delivered as separate prefabricated components and assembled on a site with a small footprint, the project combined a pavilion with landscaping such as block-work garden walls. Alexa Kempton, the editor of Houses magazine, says the project showcased the potential of modular housing. \u201cWhat made it a winner was that it combined the benefits of prefab construction \u2013 the time and cost efficiencies that come with that methodology \u2013 with design excellence,\u201d Kempton says. She says Stafford Heights demonstrates that prefabrication does not mean compromising on any of the elements that previously gave it an image problem \u2013 \u201caesthetics, quality and durability\u201d.    State governments around the country have begun to show serious interest. Queensland has committed to continuing its apprentice-led QBuild program, manufacturing prefabricated homes in a Brisbane factory. Correctional Services NSW has committed to increase the number of modular homes it will build by June 2025 to increase Indigenous housing supply. And in Victoria the state government has begun delivering modular housing designed by Arkit to those at risk of homelessness. Maddison says changing attitudes is vital. Australia has the largest homes on average in the world and modular housing \u2013 like the tiny homes movement \u2013 encourages people to think about having a smaller footprint. \u201cIf you can swing people\u2019s aspirations around to being leaner, more stripped back, and not based on a French provincial or a Georgian home \u2026 people can digest the simplicity of modular building without all the paraphernalia, and it is just as affordable.\u201d O\u2019Donnell says the simplicity of modular design meant he was not encouraged to \u201cbuild the Taj Mahal\u201d but had enough design choices to shape his project into much more than a box. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of comments, because there is a walking track not very far from there, so a lot of local people see it. \u201cThe look of it is good, it\u2019s got a character of its own and it\u2019s really easy to look after and to live in.\u201d", "Jim Chalmers\u2019 first budget comes amid a darkening economic outlook.

At stake are commodity prices that hover not far off record levels but won\u2019t defy gravity if China stumbles.

Still unknowable, though, is how those fixed rates will respond when they hit the \u201cre-fi\u201d cliff from next May, when those paying 2% interest will suddenly face as much as 5% when they refinance. Business investment will also retreat as borrowing costs rise, with the 6% increase forecast for 2022-23 almost halving to 3.5% in 2023-24. Jobs and wages  Demand in the economy will be shored up, though, provided Treasury is right to expect the jobless rate to rise only modestly from 3.5% in October to 4.5% by the June quarter of 2024. That rate would still be below the pre-pandemic unemployment tally of 5%.  It is also pencilling in annual wage growth continuing to pick up, reaching 3.75% by June 2023, or the quickest pace since 2012. Only in the 2023-24 year will wage increases exceed consumer price inflation, barely making inroads into the 3.5% cut in real wages during the fiscal year just ended. Power struggle Energy prices will be a bane as well as a boon for the economy. Elevated gas and thermal coal prices will propel household and business utility bills skyward in the next two years, adding 0.75 percentage points to inflation in 2022-23, and one percentage point in 2023-24.   Related: Federal budget 2022 summary \u2013 winners and losers: who will benefit and who was left behind?    That jolt implies energy will make up about one-sixth of the expected 5.75% inflation rate forecast for this fiscal year, and almost one-third of the 3.5% CPI projected for 2023-24.  That will translate into retail power prices increasing by an average of 20% nationally in late 2022 and a further 30% in 2023-24, as the impact of higher fuel costs and ageing coal plants hits home. Despite a spurt in global energy prices, however, the government\u2019s petroleum resource rent tax will only tip in an extra $200m in 2022-23 compared with pre-election estimates. Over the four years of the budget, receipts actually sink $450m compared with that early forecast as output from depleted fields declines and prices of oil and gas stabilise. The burden of debt On the positive side, buoyant commodity prices and more people in jobs will deliver a cumulative $42.7bn improvement to the underlying cash balance across the four years to 2025-26. However, that balance will remain firmly in the red, rising from 1.4% of GDP in the year to last June to 1.8-2.0% of GDP by 2024-25 and 2025-26.  Gross debt will also pass $1tn in 2023-24, up from $895bn in the year just ended, to $1.159tn by 2025-26.

By 2025-26, the net cost of servicing federal debt will reach $26.5bn, or 1% of GDP, or about double the $13.5bn to be shelled out this fiscal year. However, the sting in debt repayments will come later since most debt out to 2026 will still be on low interest rates. By 2032-33, debt repayments will climb to 1.8% of GDP, with the cost climbing by an annual average of 14.4% in the decade from 2022-23, eclipsing a projected 13.8% rise in the NDIS and more than double the expansion for spending on defence, aged care, hospitals, medical costs and age pensions. Should China\u2019s growth hold up, so should commodity prices that help fill coffers and boost company profits. Treasury\u2019s conservative approach means the budget is forecasting the coal price to plummet about 80% by March and halve for both coal and iron ore.

Labor has sought to put its stamp on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade after warnings from the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, that it needs to upgrade its capability to confront increasingly challenging strategic times. The biggest new funding measure is $1.4bn in additional foreign aid, spread over four years and mostly concentrated on the Pacific ($900m) and south-east Asia ($470m).

That increase means ODA will be about 0.2% of gross national income. Australia\u2019s ODA is expected to rise to $4.77bn next financial year, $4.78bn the year after, and $4.87bn in 2025-26.

Sadly, a lack of infrastructure, funding and innovative policies, combined with regulations and restrictions that strangle existing and emerging industries, has seen our beautiful shire decline in recent years. Fortunately, we are currently benefiting from a population influx as Australians choose to escape the Covid-19 crisis in metropolitan areas in favour of our laid-back lifestyle, surrounded by pristine natural attractions and world-class fishing.   Related: Labor unveils $20m plan to use Australia Post trucks to find rural mobile coverage blackspots    While we attempt to capitalise on the opportunities presented by this exciting new trend, a strain is put on our meagre infrastructure and we are reminded of the gaps. The upcoming election further reinforces the importance of these issues, highlighting that small business owners in regional Australia like myself require the critical infrastructure taken for granted in the bigger cities to increase the capacity and efficiency of our operations. Telecommunications, for example, remains a persistent challenge. Locals joke that \u201conce you\u2019re north of Townsville, you\u2019d might as well be on the moon\u201d but how can we support our residents and businesses or attract investment without adequate mobile phone service and internet speeds? While new residents invigorate the economy and oftentimes address local skills shortages, the availability (or lack thereof) of rental properties presents another barrier. Despite an oversupply of existing and affordable houses that need a little TLC, there is little incentive to actually purchase these properties, so many people opt to buy vacant land and build from scratch.   Interactive   This is great for the construction industry, but the capacity of our local tradies and suppliers is limited and we would love to see existing housing stock given a new lease on life. For years we lobbied for the First Home Owners Grant (FHOG) to be expanded to include existing homes, but both levels of government made excuses not to expand the program due to the alleged \u201cartificial inflation\u201d of prices that would ensue. Further requests for renovations to existing homes to become eligible under the FHOG again fell on deaf ears, despite the support of construction industry bodies, real estate agents and Katter\u2019s Australian Party. Sadly, the Australian government\u2019s Home Building Grant brought little benefit to our region, because the minimum renovation value was set too high and new home construction was concentrated in the cities. Conversely, the recent funding announcement for Hells Gate Dam was appreciated. Water security supports agriculture which is the backbone of our local economy.   Related: \u2018Pie in the sky\u2019: Coalition\u2019s $6bn dams pitch puts politics before process    The high-value crop production attributed to Hells Gate Dam is expected to yield $800m a year, indicating that the $5.6bn investment will pay off quickly. This project will support agricultural diversification for a more resilient economy but, as always, the devil is in the detail. Sadly, flood mitigation hasn\u2019t been prioritised and many fear the project will never amount to its full potential. Why can\u2019t local issues like flooding be factored into major projects? Similarly, we initially rejoiced at the announcement that a $10bn reinsurance pool was being introduced after dealing with sky-high premiums for years, but as details slowly emerged, we began to have doubts. While we still hope to see some savings, it clearly won\u2019t be the salvation we were hoping for. The scope of the scheme disregards the reality of our local experiences and limits the benefits we were looking forward to. These issues aside, we cannot deny the benefits of the Boosting Apprenticeships Commencement scheme and other programs that supported our ability to employ and retain staff after Covid-19 emerged. My husband and I are proud to provide jobs to local young people so that they don\u2019t have to leave their families, or their home towns, to search for work in the cities. All in all, we feel that we have been heard and supported (at least a little) in the last few years. It\u2019s frustrating that it takes an election to see funding committed and promises made after years of neglect, but there has certainly been progress. Now that a federal election is looming, many in the area fear the thought of Labor securing power due to their perceived association with the Greens. We live in an agricultural region that is trying to grow tourism and all too often we see governments making \u201c&#x8;environmentally-friendly\u201d decisions without understanding the impacts of their policies, or the reality of the issues they are trying to tackle. Our farmers are not destroying the reef, they\u2019re feeding the nation. Improved marine access won\u2019t destroy ecosystems, it will support new industries. And don\u2019t get us started on urban flying-fox roosts! While most of these grievances are under the state\u2019s jurisdiction, the fear is ever-present; would life get harder if the Australian Labor party exerted more pressure and control over our lives at a federal level as well as a state level? What we need moving forward is less pandering to metropolitan voters and more focus on local needs, local challenges and local solutions. We want less red-tape and less green-tape. We want a government that understands and appreciates small business, not a government that applauds the jobs we create while collecting our taxes to invest elsewhere. We want genuine and meaningful representation.

The Guardian understands new Treasury forecasts for the 25 October budget also predict inflation will be higher, for longer. Inflation will peak in the December quarter, as expected, at just under 8%, but officials now expect Australia\u2019s cost of living squeeze will be more protracted, largely because of the spike in power bills.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Unemployment is also expected to be higher, when compared to the July economic forecast, because of the global economic headwinds, interest rate hikes and sustained inflationary pressure.

Related: What is Australia\u2019s \u2018lamington\u2019 tax break and how much is it worth to you?    While inflationary pressure would remain front-and-centre for households and businesses, higher commodity prices and historically low unemployment levels will deliver the Albanese government a revenue boon over the next two years. The forecast for tax receipts on Tuesday night will be revised up by more than $100bn over the forward estimates. But Treasury expects that windfall to be short lived. Two-thirds of the forecast revenue upgrades were concentrated in the first two years of the forward estimates, which was 2022-23 and 2023-24. Treasury expected employment growth to slow and commodity prices to moderate over the two remaining financial years, while baked-in expenditure on essential services would have a more profound impact on the budget bottom line. Higher inflation would also increase the indexation of government payments. Ahead of delivering its first budget, the Albanese government confirmed this week the National Disability Insurance Scheme was forecast to cost $8.8bn more than expected across the forward estimates. That signature scheme was now forecast to cost more than $50bn a year by 2025-26. Higher spending on the NDIS, health and defence would increase the deficit over the last two years of the forward estimates. Senior officials have told Guardian Australia the government had no plans to respond to cost of living pressures by extending the Morrison government\u2019s tax offset for low and middle income earners, or with one-off cash payments to help cover grocery or energy bills. The \u201clamington\u201d tax offset, which gives low and middle income earners a tax break of between $255 and $1,080, was first announced as a temporary measure in 2018. It was extended by the Coalition during the pandemic, and in an $8.6bn pre-election cash-splash budget that included a temporary cut in fuel excise. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been signalling for weeks that fiscal and monetary policy needed to be in alignment to help subdue inflationary pressure in the economy. In a pre-budget interview with Guardian Australia, the treasurer said the government\u2019s job, given the conditions, was to provide cost of living relief \u201cin the most responsible way, and that meant not putting additional pressure on inflation\u201d. The government had promised voters cheaper childcare from July next year, and Tuesday night\u2019s budget would also include a $787.1m investment to cut the cost of general prescriptions by 29%, with the maximum cost to drop by $12.50 to $30.00. The budget would provide for additional drugs to be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The government would also extend eligibility for Covid-19 antivirals, effective 1 November.

It comes after the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, last week unveiled a draft national plan to tackle feral cats. Plibersek acknowledged that while feral cats were the main threat to native wildlife, \u201cdomestic cats have to be properly managed as well\u201d. The government\u2019s feral cat plan has familiar echoes in a threatened species strategy unveiled in 2015 by the then environment minister under the Coalition, Greg Hunt. At the time, the government set a target to cull 2m feral cats by 2020, a figure researchers later described as being based on a \u201cshaky scientific foundation\u201d.   Related: Keeping cats indoors is a rare solution where everybody wins | Calla Wahlquist    Conservation groups including the Nature Conservation Council and Invasive Species Council on Monday called for the New South Wales government to amend state legislation that prevents local councils from implementing cat containment policies. What\u2019s the problem with pet cats? Domestic cats have impacts on native wildlife in two ways, says Prof Sarah Legge of the Australian National University. \u201cOne is that they hunt themselves. They hunt at a lower rate than a feral cat, but because pet cats live at really high density in towns and suburbs, the predation toll per square kilometre is actually much higher than it is out in the bush.\u201d Her research has found that pet cats kill up to 50 times more animals per square kilometre in urban areas than feral cats kill in natural environments. \u201cThe other pathway is if we have a lot of pet cats that are not desexed, then there\u2019s a risk that unwanted litters keep contributing to the feral cat population,\u201d Legge says.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Modelling Legge has done for the Invasive Species Council suggests that roaming pet cats kill 546m animals per year in Australia, of which 323m are native. \u201cMost pet owners don\u2019t think their cat is the problem, but the evidence is that nearly all roaming pet cats hunt and kill our native wildlife,\u201d says Jack Gough, advocacy manager at the Invasive Species Council. An estimated 71% of all pet cats in Australia are able to roam \u2013 of this figure, 78% of roaming cats hunt. Most animals \u2013 an estimated 85% \u2013 killed by pet cats are not brought home. \u201cFor every dead lizard or bird you find on your doorstep, another four have been left out in the bush,\u201d Gough says. What measures are in place to stop pet cats from killing native wildlife? Dr Brad Smith, the acting chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, says: \u201cIn Victoria, about half of the local councils have implemented cat containment, while the ACT has introduced territory-wide cat containment. \u201cWhen legislated, this has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of native birds, reptiles and marsupials that are killed each night by pet cats.\u201d   Related: Environmentalists condemn Australia\u2019s \u2018woeful record\u2019 after 48 plants and animals added to threatened species list    In Victoria, at least 38 local governments have implemented either dusk-to-dawn or 24-hour cat containment policies. In Queensland, 74 out of 77 councils have 24/7 containment rules in place. \u201cThe pillars of responsible cat ownership are registration, identification, a cap on the numbers of cats you can keep in the house, desexing and containment,\u201d Legge says. \u201cThere is no consistency on any of those five measures across the states and jurisdictions \u2013 they all do different things. \u201cLocal governments are responsible for pet cat management, but what they can do is constrained by what\u2019s in their state legislation. In the case of NSW and Western Australia, the state legislation doesn\u2019t allow local governments to put in place cat containment laws in specific areas.\u201d What more should be done to address the issue? \u201cWe support cat containment across the country, as one of the most effective measures to protect Australian wildlife,\u201d Smith says. Cat containment is beneficial for both native wildlife and cat health, Gough says. \u201cCats that are kept at home have lower vet bills, don\u2019t get run over, don\u2019t get injured at the same rate, and live for up to 10 years longer than free-roaming cats. And they don\u2019t go out and kill our birds, mammals, frogs and reptiles.\u201d The Nature Conservation Council and Invasive Species Council, as well as Birdlife Australia, Wires and the Australian Wildlife Society, are calling on the NSW government to amend the NSW Companion Animals Act 1998, to enable local councils to enforce anti-roaming laws for pet cats. In WA, provisions under Cat Act 2011 do not allow for enforced containment. Legge says improving regulatory pathways in both states is an important measure. She says it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow we support local governments to get these laws in place, how they\u2019re resourced to police the laws, how we encourage the public to go along with it\u201d. \u201cSolving the feral cat problem is really difficult \u2026 solving the pet cat problem \u2013 technically [is] really easy.

Related: NSW Labor accused of \u2018fundamental breach of trust\u2019 over logging in promised koala national park    Sharpe said there had been no logging operations in these areas since 1 September after the government reached an agreement with the NSW Forestry Corporation. The hubs cover about 5% of the 176,000 ha of forest that the government will assess for potential protection within a great koala national park but the government said they contain 42% of the recorded koala sightings in state forests in the assessment area since 2000. The decision has been cautiously welcomed by conservation groups but the National Parks Association of NSW urged the government to go further and impose a logging suspension across the entire area of the proposed park. The suspension will remain in place while the government embarks on a process to establish the park. The reviews are expected to be complete by the final quarter of 2024, with the park established as soon as possible after the process has been finalised.

It said it was balancing its commitment to protect environmentally sensitive areas with the \u201cdevelopment of a plan to sustain a viable timber industry and jobs\u201d. \u201cThe creation of the great koala national park is essential to saving koalas from extinction in NSW,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cThe government is taking serious steps towards its creation and will work closely with the community, Aboriginal organisations and industry as the areas for inclusion in the park are assessed.\u201d It follows months of protests over logging operations in forests within the proposed park \u2013 such as Newry state forest \u2013 as well as in areas further north.   Related: NSW group launches court bid to stop logging in bushfire-ravaged koala habitats    Grahame Douglas, the president of the National Parks Association of NSW, said the group welcomed the chance to participate in the process, which he hoped would bring a quick resolution to establish the park and move to sustainable plantation timbers on the mid-north coast. \u201cThere are other areas that are still in need of protection such as Oakes state forest where logging should also be suspended,\u201d he said. The NSW Greens environment spokesperson Sue Higginson said it was a \u201csignificant development in the six month conflict Labor waged against the community\u201d but was not enough. \u201cThis announcement will do nothing to protect Oakes State Forest or the Kalang Headwaters, areas that were categorised as the highest priority conservation areas in the state by the former government and that are within the boundaries of the proposed great koala national park,\u201d she said. She said, at a minimum, the government should also protect all koala hubs across the state\u2019s entire native forest estate. The EPA has been charged with ensuring that there is no increase in logging in the permitted areas to compensate for the halt to logging within the hubs. The government has been under immense pressure to end native forest logging, following moves by two states \u2013 Victoria and Western Australia. In May the Victorian government announced native forest logging in Victoria will end in December, six years earlier than previously planned, after the state government decided severe bushfires and legal campaigns had made it economically and environmentally unviable. The agriculture and regional NSW minister, Tara Moriarty, said the government \u201ccommits to working closely with the industry to develop a blueprint for the future timber sector that accommodates both the park and the production of timber products\u201d. Continued logging of native timber forests in state forests, as opposed to plantation timber has become a hot button issue in several states due to the impact it has on threatened species that are under additional pressures due to bushfires. NSW Forestry Corporation says the north-east hardwood industry, covering an area from the Hunter to the NSW-Queensland border, contributes $700m to the NSW economy and employs about 3,800 workers across the sector. It has said that of the two million hectares of state forests that it manages, half is managed for conservation and between 1% and 2% of the available area is harvested each year.", "\u2018Abysmal\u2019 number of Australian banks and super funds have policies to mitigate environmental risks: report [2022-12-12T14:00:03Z]": "Australia\u2019s major banks and superannuation funds are failing to properly assess the damage their investments and financial decisions do to nature or set targets to reverse that damage, according to new analysis.

No bank or super fund surveyed had a policy related to biodiversity offsets and only 50% had a carbon offset policy. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a business destroying wildlife habitat for more cattle grazing in Queensland, or a property developer knocking over trees for more suburban sprawl, there\u2019s almost always a financial institution bankrolling the activity,\u201d said ACF\u2019s business and nature campaigner Nathaniel Pelle. \u201cThe financial sector bears particular responsibility for reversing the nature crisis because it decides which activities are financed or insured and under what conditions.\u201d The report finds that although Australia has the developed world\u2019s highest rate of nature destruction, companies were more likely to have policies to avoid financing nature destruction overseas \u2013 such as palm oil financing \u2013 than to protect the koala and other Australian species. The Albanese government confirmed on Monday that it would develop a climate risk disclosure system that would require banks and other big businesses to publicly reveal what they were doing to cut emissions.

The Albanese government has launched a campaign at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt to co-host the annual climate conference with Pacific neighbours in four years. The proposal could bring tens of thousands of people to an Australian city for climate negotiations and advocacy and has won support from the Pacific Islands Forum. Vanuatu\u2019s new climate change minister, Ralph Regenvanu, told Guardian Australia the support should be conditional. A former foreign affairs minister who took on responsibility for climate change after national elections last month, Regenvanu said he was not critical of the Albanese government, describing it as a \u201cbreath of fresh air\u201d and a refreshing change after the Morrison government, which was widely criticised for its inaction on global heating. \u2022 Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But he said his government could not endorse Australia\u2019s co-hosting bid if it invested more money in developing fossil fuels, and would call on other Pacific countries to adopt the same stance. \u201cI will be talking to other Pacific island nations to make our support for Australia hosting the Cop conditional on no new government money being given to fossil fuels,\u201d he said. Regenvanu also called on Australia to rejoin the Green Climate Fund, which finances climate and clean energy projects in developing countries. Scott Morrison abruptly withdrew Australia from the fund in 2019, arguing his government would instead pay climate funding directly to Pacific countries.   Related: Lula vows to undo environmental degradation and halt deforestation    Some Pacific countries have indicated they prefer this model as they believe the Green Climate Fund has not not focused enough on clean developments in the region. The Albanese government has not yet declared its position on the global fund, but announced an additional $900m to support climate development and resilience in the Pacific in the October budget. Regenvanu said Australia should rejoin the fund to help fix it. \u201cI told the minister that they need to get into the Green Climate Fund and change it so the most vulnerable countries, including in the Pacific, have access,\u201d he said. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has said there would be no government finance for new coal and gas fields under Labor, and some funding for gas and carbon capture and storage developments announced under the Coalition was redirected in the budget. But the government has been criticised for maintaining $1.5bn equity support announced by the Morrison government for Darwin Harbour\u2019s middle arm industrial precinct, which is expected to include developments using gas, and for expanding the offshore area available for oil and gas exploration. Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is a major focus for some countries at Cop27, with Tuvalu joining Vanuatu in calling for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. Debate on Wednesday focused on the wording of a possible agreement, with Bowen co-leading discussions over text dealing with long-term climate finance.

Loss and damage, which refers to a push by developing countries for a fund or facility to pay for the impact of worsening climate disasters, appeared the most contentious. The Alliance of Small Island States, a negotiating bloc, said it feared some wealthy countries were backtracking on the issue. The most energised public moment of the day was a public appearance by the Brazilian president-elect, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who vowed to begin undoing environmental damage that took place seen under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, and to work towards ending deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Later this week, Regenvanu is expected to use Cop27 to launch a final version of a resolution Vanuatu plans to put to the UN General Assembly. The resolution will ask the International Court of Justice for advice on the obligations of states to protect the rights of present and future generations against the effects of climate change. Cop27 is due to finish on Friday night, but negotiations have been slow and some observers believe they will continue into the weekend.", "The Labor-Greens deal on the safeguard mechanism gives each party a win | Paul Karp [2023-03-27T06:48:53Z]": "The Labor-Greens deal on the safeguard mechanism won\u2019t put a stop to new coal and gas projects, but it will put a hard enough brake that we\u2019ll hear the screech if any get the government\u2019s go-ahead. For weeks the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been locked in negotiations determined to pass the signature climate bill without taking up the minor party\u2019s \u201coffer not ultimatum\u201d of no new coal and gas. \nThrough rounds of interviews urging them to help reduce emissions, Bowen has ruled out a ban, a pause and a climate trigger in environmental approval laws. \nBut behind the scenes, the Greens were fashioning demands they say amount to the next best thing. \nOn Monday the deal was revealed. At its heart is a cap on participants\u2019 emissions of 1,233m tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 or about 140m tonnes a year. \n \n  Related: The latest IPCC report makes it clear no new fossil fuel projects can be opened. That includes us, Australia | Adam Morton  \n \nInstead of an obligation on the environment minister to consider the greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel projects at the approval stage, the Climate Change Authority will report on whether expanded or new projects will blow the carbon budget. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nThe climate and energy minister then has to respond, with flexibility to impose greater emissions reduction on existing industries or the new entrants. \nWith powers this broad, it\u2019s easy to see how requiring \u201cbest practices\u201d from new entrants (such as reducing emissions every year) could morph into carbon neutrality. \nIn fact, the Greens have locked in net zero for the direct scope one emissions of projects in the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory and new liquefied natural gas export projects. \nNo public funds from the Powering the Regions Fund or the existing energy department grants will be spent on fossil fuel extraction. \nThese measures are designed to allow Labor to say that new gas projects for domestic consumption are still possible, while the Greens argue that they have made giant carbon bombs like Beetaloo unviable. \nTo be successful, fossil fuel projects must run the gauntlet of two ministers. They\u2019ll either be blocked, or if they get through, the Greens will hang them around Labor\u2019s neck like an albatross. \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    \n    The safeguard mechanism was introduced by the Coalition in 2016. It was promised to put a limit on greenhouse gas emissions from about 200 major industrial facilities.&nbsp;\n    It applies to facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. Each facility is set an emissions limit, known as a baseline.\n    The Coalition said companies that emitted above their baseline would have to buy carbon offsets or pay a penalty. In practice, facilities were allowed to change their baselines, few were penalised and industrial emissions continued to increase.\n    Labor won government planning to revamp the scheme.\n    It has set new baselines based on emissions intensity \u2013 how much a facility releases per unit of production. Baselines will be reduced by up to 4.9% a year.&nbsp;\n    Companies can choose whether to make onsite emissions cuts or buy offsets, including Australian carbon credit units.\n    New polluting facilities, including gas and coalmines, are allowed to open and enter the scheme and would be set baselines at \u201cinternational best practice\u201d. For new gas fields, that means offsetting all CO2 pollution so they are net zero.\n    Companies that emit less pollution than their baseline allows will be awarded a new type of \u201csafeguard credit\u201d. These within-scheme credits can be sold to other polluting facilities that emit more than their baseline and need offsets.\n    A deal between Labor and the Greens introduced an absolute \"cap\" so that total emissions under the scheme can not increase and need to come down over time. The pace of reduction is not stipulated, and will be set by the climate change minister\n    The changes start on 1 July 2023.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nWhen the then opposition leader, Bill Shorten, faced a difficult decision about whether to promise to block the Adani coalmine, he said the project had to \u201cstack up commercially and environmentally\u201d, as if the environmental considerations could be determined as objectively as a financial balance sheet. \nIn reality they can\u2019t. The balance between whether to squeeze a new lithium or a new coalmine into the carbon budget, or whether to impose tougher rules on existing industries or new fossil fuel projects is properly the domain of politics. \nOne Greens parliamentarian observed to me what a unique position they find themselves in: a green party in the balance of power (in one house at least) in a fossil fuel exporting nation. \nThe global system of carbon accounting does not put emissions of gas we export on our account. Perhaps it should, but it doesn\u2019t. \nThe Greens\u2019 bargaining position isn\u2019t strong enough to rewrite the rules entirely or force Labor to overturn election commitments not to ban new coal and gas. \nWhat the safeguard deal shows, though, is they are strong enough to tilt the field and make it harder for projects to \u201cstack up\u201d. \n \n  Related: As Australia faces a \u2018hydrogen tipping point\u2019, the energy industry needs smart policies, not huge handouts  \n \nAfter the deal was revealed, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and Bowen were peppered with questions about power prices. \nThis will be the Coalition\u2019s line of attack: anything that makes fossil fuel projects harder must increase power prices. In reality, most of our gas is exported and extending supply to meet that global demand does almost nothing to domestic prices. \nThey won\u2019t care. Question time is already chewed up by grandstanding aimed at lambasting Labor for power price rises that are occurring mainly due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \nThe Coalition is also upset the $275 power price improvement from renewable energy Labor promised by 2025 hasn\u2019t materialised yet. \nAnd the fact that power prices went up after the government\u2019s coal and gas price cap intervention to the opposition is evidence the policy isn\u2019t working \u2013 instead of the more logical conclusion that they would\u2019ve gone up by more without it. \nExpect to hear these lines all the way to the election: \u201cwe tried to stop new coal and gas and they wouldn\u2019t let us\u201d from the Greens; \u201cLabor has caved to the Greens, hobbled our industries and hurt households\u201d from the Coalition. \nIn the meantime, a deal is a win for the government, which somehow continues to find a way on climate change despite sky-high demands.", "Greens lambast Labor for failing to offer extra funding for global nature deal at Cop15 [2022-12-19T01:17:33Z]": "The Greens have criticised the Albanese government for failing to offer any new money for conservation measures at a global conference aiming to secure a new agreement for nature for the next decade. Countries have been meeting at the Cop15 summit in Montreal to negotiate targets for the protection and restoration of nature, including a target of $US200bn a year to fund conservation work. There have also been calls for developed nations to establish and pay into a fund to support conservation measures in poorer countries.   Related: Cop15 negotiators close to agreeing nature deal as talks draw to end    While countries including Germany and France have made additional funding pledges, Australia has been criticised for failing to offer more than its existing budget commitments despite the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, using the summit to push for tougher targets on halting extinctions and protecting land and sea areas. The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who has been attending the summit, said she was disappointed \u201cno money from Australia was put on the table to help those negotiations come along\u201d. \u201cWe saw a lot of money pledged by countries like Germany.

Australia has been an advocate for such a target in the agreement, having already set a zero extinctions target domestically. O\u2019Shanassy said \u201cmoney is essential to ending extinction, so it\u2019s disappointing that there were no new funding commitments from Australia at Cop15\u201d. \u201cAustralia has a lot at stake \u2013 our species are unique and found nowhere else on this planet \u2013 we have a lot to lose.

Scientists have estimated $2bn is needed a year in the federal budget to recover Australia\u2019s full list of almost 2,000 threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. When it announced its zero extinctions target and a revamped threatened species strategy in October, scientists and environment groups warned the government would need to drastically increase funding to support domestic conservation measures.

Much of the government\u2019s discussion of conservation funding has been focused on boosting private investment, including through a proposed nature restoration market. Plibersek told the ABC\u2019s AM program on Monday that the government increased funding for the environment in the October budget and \u201cwe are determined not only to increase government funding but to make it easier for others to invest in repairing nature as well\u201d.

Since meeting the company, she said she remained frustrated by Hesta\u2019s continued investments in fossil fuels and still wanted the fund to divest. Millie Horsburgh, 16, from Melbourne, said she felt Hesta had used SS4C\u2019s reputation \u201cto cover up its investments in fossil fuels\u201d. In an earlier letter to Hesta seen by the Guardian from October 2021, SS4C raised concerns about images of school strikers being used in Hesta\u2019s advertising \u201cto attract new members\u201d and those concerns were followed up in a meeting the following month. According to Rachel Deans, a superannuation fund campaigner at Market Forces, a climate campaign group focused on the investments of financial institutions, Hesta has about $2bn invested in companies expanding fossil fuels. Analysis of Hesta\u2019s public disclosures showed the fund had $190m invested in gas company Santos, $228m in another gas firm Woodside, as well as about $2m invested in Adani \u2013 an India-based conglomerate behind the controversial Carmichael coalmine and rail project in Queensland. Deans said Market Forces was organising a \u201cdivestment day\u201d on 17 June when it expected at least 100 Hesta members to leave the fund in protest over its fossil fuel investments. Deans said the advertisements \u201cmakes it seem that Hesta is more clean and green than it actually is\u201d. The new legal letter was sent via email to Hesta\u2019s chief executive, Debby Blakey, on Thursday morning. The letter points to guidance from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, saying advertisers should not \u201cfalsely represent\u201d that it has endorsement or approval that it doesn\u2019t have. According to Hesta\u2019s website, climate change is \u201cone of the most significant threats to our economies, societies and environment\u201d and the fund wants to \u201cestablish ourselves as an industry leader in climate action\u201d. In a statement, Hesta said the company had used \u201ca generic, paid stock image of a climate protest sign to reflect the general public conversation around climate action, not to suggest an affiliation with another organisation\u201d. The statement said: \u201cAs soon as we became aware the SS4C group had concerns we removed the advert in March 2022.\u201d The company said Hesta had \u201ca long track record of actively engaging with companies we own\u201d and it believed this approach was \u201cmore effective than divestment\u201d at moving away from fossil fuels. \u201cWe have met with representatives from SS4C to explain our active ownership approach to climate change and we continue to welcome dialogue with a range of stakeholders interested in supporting the transition to a low carbon future. \u201cWe detail our active ownership activities in HESTA\u2019s annual report. On our website we provide our share voting record, investment holdings and annual climate reports, which detail progress towards portfolio-wide, net zero targets.\u201d Last month Hesta said it was opposed to plans by energy company AGL \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitter \u2013 to split its business to seperate its fossil fuel generation from the rest of the company.", "Majority of Australians on jobseeker and parenting payments live in poverty, study finds [2023-03-21T14:00:07Z]": "The majority of people on the jobseeker and parenting payments are living in poverty while about a third of single parents are also below the breadline, according to a new study. A report from the University of New South Wales and the Australian Council of Social Service, to be released on Wednesday, provides further insight into the demographics of 3 million people, including 761,000 children, previously identified as living in poverty in the 2019-20 financial year. The Labor government awaits a separate report from the independent economic inclusion advisory committee, which was established to comment on the adequacy of welfare payments before the May budget.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Acoss report uses the relative poverty line measure of 50% of median household income, meaning a single person living on less than $489 a week was in poverty. For a couple with two children, the poverty line was $1,027 a week. It found 60% of people on the jobseeker payment, 72% of people on the parenting payment, and 34% of people on youth allowance lived in poverty.   Related: Quitting alcohol, moving home and returning to work at 70: how rising costs have changed Australians\u2019 lives    The same was true for 34% of sole parent families, compared with 11% of people in partnered families with children. The gendered aspect of poverty was demonstrated by the fact 18% of households where the main earner was a woman were below the breadline. The figure was 10% when the main earner was male. Home ownership was also a key indicator: 20% of private renters and 52% of those in public housing were in poverty, compared with 10% for homeowners with a mortgage and 8% for homeowners without one. Those on the youth allowance payment experienced deep poverty, living on average $390 a week below the poverty line, as did those receiving jobseeker ($269 a week below the poverty line) and parenting payment ($246). While jobseeker is intended as an unemployment benefit, it is increasingly accessed by people with illnesses or disabilities, including some who are locked out of the disability support pension due to changes by successive governments. Sixty-one-year-old Tracy Krupa, who lives in regional Victoria, has been out of work since losing her job in 2018. Krupa lives on a farm with her husband, who receives the age pension. She said social security payments were \u201ctotally inadequate\u201d, particularly for those with extra expenses due to health or disability. She said she had been hospitalised for five months due to a severe bowel condition in 2021 and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer. \u201cWhen I got out of hospital, I started chemo, which for me was fortnightly treatment, which involved a 300km return trip, twice a week,\u201d she said. \u201cRight at the time when the \u2026 fuel prices went up. And then we had got hit with the cost-of-living increases, and interest rates. We got hit with a triple whammy.\u201d Krupa is still unable to work as she recovers from her bowel condition, meaning she is stuck on the jobseeker payment. The Acoss chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, said the fact that a majority of people relying on unemployment payments and parenting payments lived in poverty showed the system was \u201ctotally inadequate to meet the essentials of life\u201d. Goldie said the report provided further evidence of the need for a \u201cpoverty reduction package in the May budget\u201d.   Related: Workers face longer hours for less pay without productivity boost, Jim Chalmers says    The report covers a period before the pandemic and its early months in 2020, again building on past research that showed poverty briefly fell dramatically when income support was boosted through the coronavirus supplement. The ABS data analysed was compiled before the inflation spike and, in particular, the huge increase in rents in some areas. On Tuesday two MPs launched a bipartisan push for an increase to welfare benefits and women\u2019s advocates will meet in parliament on Wednesday to call on the government to reinstate parenting payment to thousands of single mothers. In 2005 the Howard government changed welfare rules to see single parents dropped from the parenting payment to the lower unemployment benefit when their child turned eight. The Gillard government subsequently removed a \u201cgrandfathering\u201d arrangement in 2011. Those changes are widely viewed as instrumental in increasing poverty rates among single mothers. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, told ABC Radio National this week the government was \u201clooking at payments\u201d. Gallagher said she was aware that women\u2019s advocates were concerned about the Howard/Gillard era changes. \u201cThe prime minister has said a number of times that every budget we go through, we will go through and look at what\u2019s happening on the payment side,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will feed into decisions we take in the budget.\u201d", "Funding models \u2018actively discourage\u2019 specialist mental health practitioners from working in regional Australia [2022-12-15T14:00:25Z]": "Dr Michael Block is one of the only specialist perinatal psychiatrists living in rural Victoria.

The private sector doesn\u2019t have a private mother-baby unit, so it means I rely on Medicare ... and so the amount of income you can earn is reduced compared to the city.\u201d   Related: \u2018If it takes a village, where\u2019s mine?\u2019: new mums in rural Australia lack mental health services    His comments come as a rural health survey conducted by newspaper group ACM found regional and rural patients are travelling an average of 122km to see a specialist, while more than half are waiting weeks or months to see a GP.

Block says the pandemic, cost of living pressures, floods and bushfires have had a cumulative effect on increasing demand for mental health services in the regions.  \u201cEveryone has been swamped with business, psychiatrists, psychologists \u2013 we got more work than we can do,\u201d he says. \u201cBetween the north-east and Melbourne, I\u2019ve been getting five new referral requests a week.

I\u2019m going to be retired before this is going to be fixed \u2026 That\u2019s not acceptable for us really.\u201d A Victorian government spokesperson said the Andrews government was investing $372m in hiring 1,500 mental health workers including 100 psychiatrists and 300 psychologists, but did not say what was being done specifically to boost services in rural and regional areas. Prof Mathew Coleman, a rural psychiatrist and the chair of rural and remote mental health practice at the University of Western Australia, says the impact of natural disasters is often under-appreciated in gauging demand for mental health services in the bush. \u201cThere\u2019s a concept called rural adversity, which is natural disasters beset regional people at a higher rate than metropolitan and it\u2019s not ubiquitous,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cThat\u2019s an additional burden on communities and an additional social determinant that\u2019s not experienced at the same intensity and extent as populations in metropolitan areas, and that\u2019s not accounted for.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s the reverse: the per capita spend on mental health services in regional and rural communities is lower than in the cities, despite the prevalence being the same and the morbidity associated with the diagnosis being worse.   Related: Mental health outcomes are worse in the bush, partly because it\u2019s easier to get a gun than get help    \u201cSo you get worse outcomes from regional people, despite them experiencing exactly the same problems as city people,\u201d Coleman says. \u201cHaving an extra three psychiatrists in Mildura makes the difference between a functioning and a non-functioning system. Three psychiatrists in Melbourne makes no difference at all. \u201cSo the scale is quite modest, but the outcomes are significant in terms of changing the landscape.\u201d Coleman said he\u2019s frequently heard the problem is \u201ctoo hard\u201d to fix, but that regional practitioners could provide the solutions. \u201cAt the moment, rural and remote [Australia] is considered all the same,\u201d he says. \u201cA third of Australians live outside of capital cities but they are underrepresented at the table. Their agency hasn\u2019t evolved.\u201d Rutherford says the lack of incentives for specialists to work in regional areas is an area of concern. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of money through the colleges for professional development support, but there\u2019s certainly not the incentives for consultants, specialists to work rurally,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to incentivise more consultants coming out.

The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, wrote to Morrison on 19 March asking to go halves in the package \u2013 which was designed to pay for retrofitting, house raising or the voluntary buyback of flood-damaged homes. In a response received on Monday night, the prime minster said the programs would not be supported by the commonwealth.

On Wednesday, the Insurance Council of Australia released a statement that criticised the federal government\u2019s decision not to help fund the resilience package. In February, the ICA released a report calling for $726m to be invested jointly by the Queensland and federal governments over five years. It had welcomed the resilience funding when it was announced by the Queensland government. \u201cAs severe rain and flooding continues to impact the east coast, the failure of the federal government to match Queensland\u2019s investment in measures to improve household and community protections against extreme weather is disappointing and short-sighted,\u201d the ICA\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Hall, said. \u201cIf Australia is to get serious about improving our resilience to flood, bushfire and cyclone, all levels of government must contribute. \u201cAustralians \u2013 particularly those still impacted by the ongoing rain and flooding \u2013 want governments to come together to provide better protections against worsening extreme weather, not wash their hands of responsibility.\u201d   Related: NSW flood victims to be relocated to Queensland to make way for Byron Bay tourists    The rejection prompted an angry statement from the Queensland treasurer and acting premier, Cameron Dick, who said Morrison\u2019s response effectively said \u201cit\u2019s not his problem\u201d. \u201cEvery Queenslander needs to know that this letter shows that Scott Morrison does not care about flood victims who need help from all levels of government,\u201d Dick said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if your home floods two, three or four times over, Scott Morrison wants no part in creating an ongoing solution. \u201cEvery expert report, including his own royal commission into natural disasters, says that the federal government should be funding disaster resilience, but this prime minister will not take responsibility and do his job to fund it.\u201d", "Labor\u2019s delay on public schools funding deal a \u2018betrayal\u2019 of disadvantaged students, advocates say [2022-12-19T03:03:16Z]": "The Albanese government has been accused of betraying public schools after delaying a new funding agreement by one year. On Friday, the council of education ministers decided to extend the deal until December 2024, meaning governments will not have to increase public school funding beyond existing commitments until 2025. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, defended the delay as necessary to conduct a review to ensure funding is directed to the neediest students, but the Australian Education Union (AEU) has warned \u201cresources delayed are resources denied\u201d. Public schools receive 20% of the schooling resourcing standard (SRS) from the federal government and up to 75% from the states, but due to a loophole for capital depreciation, are set to remain at 91% of full funding for the rest of the decade. Before the 2022 election Labor committed only to develop a \u201cpathway\u201d to full funding, sparking concern from the AEU that the timeline for improvement was vague.

The AEU\u2019s president, Correna Haythorpe, said the one-year extension \u201cdelays and therefore denies students in public schools the funding they need\u201d. \u201cThere has now been a generation of children who have been denied full and fair funding for their entire school lives.

Greens schools spokesperson, senator Penny Allman-Payne, said the delay was \u201coutrageous\u201d and would see \u201cpublic school kids wait another year for a fair go while continuing to pour public money into elite private schools\u201d. \u201cThis decision will also heap further strain on under-resourced teachers and schools, and will worsen crippling teacher shortages.\u201d Clare said the federal government is still \u201ccommitted to working with state and territory governments to get every school to 100% of its fair funding level\u201d, noting that the review, to be launched next year, \u201cwill focus on driving real and measurable improvements for students from disadvantaged backgrounds\u201d.

Future funding will be tied to reform.\u201d Allman-Payne said a review by a panel of eminent Australians was unnecessary because the Gonski report \u201cdid the work already\u201d in identifying the need for more needs-based funding. \u201cThis government will have a fight on its hands in 2023 \u2026 The Greens will use every lever at our disposal, inside and outside parliament, to push Labor to deliver the funding teachers have been pleading for for a decade.\u201d Before the 2019 election, Labor promised $14bn over 10 years for public education, but the policy was dropped after it was identified in Labor\u2019s election review as one of the expensive items that required the opposition to propose more revenue raising measures. The extension of the funding agreement has no impact on non-government schools, which are on a pathway to 100% of the standard by 2029.", "Expanding electric vehicle charging network requires more government funding, advocates say [2023-01-16T14:00:10Z]": "Electric vehicle charging stations are located right across Australia but in many locations there are only one or two outlets, experts say, and that needs to change if people are to avoid lengthy queues next summer. Significant government investment in regional EV infrastructure is the key to ending the frustrations many holidaymakers have experienced over the past few weeks, a number of charging companies have said. But other businesses are more optimistic and believe the queues reported in late December and early January won\u2019t be as bad by 2024 because they are clearly demonstrating where more chargers are needed.

BP Pulse has 22 fast-charging stations across Australia and plans to build 100 by the end of 2023. Its business development manager, Josh Hoevenaars, said the current delays indicated the increasing popularity of electric vehicles. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019ve got a fairly vast network of charging stations, but it is quite shallow,\u201d Hoevenaars said. \u201cIt covers most of Australia but lots of locations only have one of two chargers. Because we don\u2019t have the depth of charging, or redundancy of charging at those locations, a lot of people have to wait. But that doesn\u2019t happen very often throughout the year, only on one or two days at peak periods.\u201d Luke Chippindale, the general manager of the Caravan Industry Association of Australia, said some holidaymakers delayed their return home by up to eight hours due to an inability to access charging stations. \u201cWe know that a lot of the charging infrastructure is based on downtime, where people have the ability to pull up for a night,\u201d Chippindale said. \u201cBut from a tourism perspective, when you start to look at range anxiety and battery capabilities, the reliance on a fast-charge network is really critical.\u201d Chippindale is lobbying governments to invest in fast-charging stations at regional caravan sites. He hopes this will encourage more electric vehicle drivers to travel longer distances with confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to make sure we keep people moving across the country, to keep people visiting the areas they love to visit and ensure there is a fairly mature charging network away from high-demand urban areas,\u201d Chippindale said.   Related: Electric planes sound like a fantasy but they may be the future for short-haul in Australia    \u201cWe know anecdotally that people are pulling in and effectively charging for five or six hours and going for a [bike] ride during that time.

Without government help, we are not going to get enough stations installed,\u201d he said. But Hoevenaars said the charging market could develop quickly thanks to more competition and investment. \u201cI am an optimist, so I would hazard a guess that we will be in a better position next year, even with increased growth of sales, because you are seeing a lot of new entrants into the charging market and also increased investment and ambition from existing operators,\u201d Hoevenaars said.", "\u2018Alcohol laws can\u2019t solve this\u2019: NT Indigenous groups welcome new funding but urge longer-term solutions  [2023-02-07T04:01:58Z]": "Indigenous organisations are welcoming much-needed federal funding for youth, employment and health investments in Central Australia, announced alongside the reintroduction of alcohol bans in the Northern Territory.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The measures will be introduced along with a federal funding boost of $250m, which the NT government said will go towards programs and diversion initiatives for young people and children in the region, support for families and elders, on-Country learning, school attendance and preventive health measures. The funding is on top of the nearly $50m for health, safety and anti-crime measures \u2013 slated during the initial restrictions announced last month - aimed at addressing the underlying issues contributing to a surge in unrest. Last month, fresh alcohol restrictions were imposed on Alice Springs, banning residents from buying takeaway alcohol on Monday and Tuesday and restricting sales on other days, prompting some to raise concerns of a return to intervention-era policies. Federal NT senator Malarndirri McCarthy told Nine\u2019s Today Show that the measures were a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d the territory government needed to enact to give communities a reprieve.

There is no home to go to. There is no food to eat. There is no job to be employed \u2013 and if you\u2019re a child, there is no place for you to even bounce a basketball,\u201d Liddle said. She said underlying the current crisis in the town is a lack of understanding about what works for people and families. \u201cPolice can\u2019t solve this, alcohol laws can\u2019t solve this, our communities have the answers,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at in the Northern Territory is decades of policy failure across all governments \u2026 underlying all of this is marginalisation and poverty. If we\u2019re not looking at what causes marginalisation \u2013 how poverty is impacting the behaviours of our mob \u2013 then we can\u2019t solve this problem.\u201d The Central Australian Aboriginal Congress also welcomed the restrictions and additional funding. CEO Donna Ah Chee said it will address a dire need after decades of underfunding in remote communities and town camps. \u201cWe have been clear that alcohol bans are not enough by themselves,\u201d Ah Chee said in a statement. \u201cWe need sustained action on the drivers of destructive drinking: intergenerational trauma, poverty, poor education and discrimination.\u201d", "Committee hears agency head made \u2018slur\u2019 against integrity commissioner Nikola Stepanov [2022-03-14T03:36:07Z]": "The chief executive of the Queensland Public Service Commission has denied claims heard by a parliamentary committee that he called the state\u2019s integrity commissioner \u201ca bitch on a witch hunt\u201d.

I had already heard it, but I was called that term by him in a phone call on or about 4 April 2018.\u201d Robert Setter has released a statement to say he was \u201cappalled and saddened\u201d by the claim. \u201cI am appalled because it is not behaviour that I consider appropriate \u2013 ever,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cI deny absolutely making any misogynistic comments to or about the integrity commissioner at any time. \u201cI am saddened because the integrity commissioner has felt it necessary to use parliamentary privilege to raise her concern in this way. \u201cThe commissioner has never raised this with me directly. Nor am I aware that the commissioner has referred her concerns to any other authority.\u201d Stepanov announced her resignation in January, sparking a much-hyped integrity saga within the Queensland public service. Stepanov \u2013 whose office regulates lobbying in Queensland \u2013 has previously raised concerns about interference with her office by the Public Service Commission (PSC), which controls her agency\u2019s budget and staffing. Those concerns include allegations the PSC removed and wiped the contents of a laptop used by an employee, and complaints that the PSC had gradually stripped resources and key staff from the integrity commissioner\u2019s office. The state parliament\u2019s economic and governance committee is holding hearings about a strategic review of the integrity commissioner\u2019s office. Stepanov gave evidence on Monday morning. She said she had written to the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and would remain in her role until at least 31 December \u2013 extending her tenure in order to oversee reforms.

Setter has previously denied suggestions he was uncooperative with Stepanov\u2019s attempts to conduct a lobbying audit of the PSC. The integrity commissioner is an independent statutory office whose responsibility is to advise MPs and public servants on ethics matters, and to regulate lobbying activities. The PSC is a central government agency assisting departments with managing their workforce. Stepanov reiterated her support for a potential commission of inquiry into the integrity matters and argued that the integrity commissioner\u2019s office should be separated from the PSC. She said she should ultimately be given control of her own office\u2019s staffing and budget. \u201cWhere I have encountered concerns about conduct, the staff within the office are PSC staff,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cYou are seeking to do your job in an environment where you don\u2019t, in effect, control the resources that support you.\u201d Stepanov had previously raised concerns about the way a PSC staff member, who had been working in her office, had handled confidential documents. She requested a forensic examination of the employee\u2019s laptop. In March 2021, the PSC removed and allegedly wiped the contents of a laptop. The Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission is investigating a complaint related to the deletion of files from the laptop. Setter\u2019s statement also addressed the broader public sector power struggle between the two offices. \u201cIt is a matter of public record that as the employer of staff in the office of the integrity commissioner, that I have been concerned for some time about allegations raised regarding the psychological safety of some staff. \u201cWhere there are matters relating to the integrity commissioner herself, I have made that information available through the appropriate channels for consideration and advice in accordance with my statutory obligations. \u201cI cannot make further comment on matters that are currently under CCC investigation. \u201cI stand on my record of respect, integrity, and leadership within the public service over many years.\u201d", "Australian arts organisations have done little to diversify white, middle-class audience, study finds [2023-07-20T15:00:18Z]": "With audience profiles still stubbornly white, middle-class and middle-aged, most of Australia\u2019s arts and cultural organisations have done little to broaden and diversify their audience base in recent years, a study has found. And the recovery from Covid-19 may have narrowed the demographic even further, according to the joint study led by Deakin University. Of the 184 Australian cultural organisations surveyed, and 1,011 individual responses from those working within arts organisations, more than half the respondents conceded they had made little or no changes to their programming or outreach programs to attract audiences from different cultures, age groups, geographic locations and gender identities.   Related: Young Australians now the least likely to attend arts events as cost of living bites    In general, arts festivals, museums and galleries, opera companies and orchestras appeared the most resistant to identifying new target audiences and adjusting programming to attract them. The study did not identify which specific organisations. The Sydney Opera House, Australia\u2019s flagship state theatre and dance companies, arts festivals and a range of state and national museums and galleries, along with many smaller regional organisations, were captured in the research. Led by the Deakin University professor of arts and cultural management, Hilary Glow, the research concluded that when it came to programming performances and exhibitions with the potential to capture new audiences, 55% of organisations fell into the \u201cavoider\u201d category \u2013 that is, ignoring or resisting change and prioritising their existing audiences to the exclusion of other potential audiences.  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning  Glow said while most organisations recognised the need to broaden their audience base to capture more diverse populations, for many it was a case of \u201ctalking the talk but not walking the walk\u201d. \u201cThey are internally focused conversations,\u201d Glow said. \u201cIf an organisation is really going to take audience diversity seriously, they\u2019re going to have to stop having fascinating conversations in their boardrooms and start bringing an external focus into the organisation.\u201d A recent trawl of major arts organisation boards conducted by the Guardian found that although gender parity was evident across most, the more traditional art forms such as opera and orchestras still had boards made up overwhelmingly of white men. A number of flagship organisations have, however, set up First Nations advisory boards, including the National Gallery of Australia, Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Earlier this year the Melbourne Theatre Company became the first major performing arts organisation to form a dedicated a group of artists diverse in culture and age to act as an advisory council to those making the programming decisions. \u201cOne of the tasks that organisations absolutely have to commit to, if they\u2019re going to diversify their audiences, is to diversify their workforce,\u201d Glowsaid. \u201cPositions across an arts organisation need to be diverse themselves. But that is not the only thing that needs to happen. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that by simply putting someone from a minority or diverse background in any kind of leadership position it\u2019s instantly going to lead to new audiences.\u201d Glow said there was evidence that \u201cavoider\u201d behaviour towards diversifying audiences was more noticeable in organisations dependent on a loyal subscriber base, bases that were severely eroded with the onset of the pandemic in 2020. \u201cWhat happens is that an organisation ends up knowing an awful lot about the demographics of the people who buy their subscription passes. They have a high level of knowledge about their existing audiences but this doesn\u2019t help them understand who isn\u2019t there. \u201cI think many organisations have set themselves up to nurture their existing audiences, possibly at the expense of thinking about investing in the pursuit of new audiences, new knowledge, new ideas and new programming.\u201d Glow said it was hard to ignore the role Covid has played in entrenched patterns of behaviour and risk-averse programming. \u201cPost-Covid, many organisations treated that as an opportunity to further build and strengthen their relationships with their current audiences,\u201d she said. Academics from Edith Cowan University and the UK\u2019s University of Sheffield, and the Australia Council Board member and theatre and festival director Wesley Enoch, also contributed to the research. The second phase of the project will see 11 selected organisations, including the Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Theatre Company, Melbourne\u2019s Rising festival and the Adelaide Festival Centre, work with a panel of change experts to develop a range of resources to attract new audiences.", "Storm drains and car parks become a cold reality for victims of Queensland\u2019s social housing crisis [2022-07-16T20:00:19Z]": "During her 14 months on Queensland\u2019s bulging social-housing waiting list, Sarah Paasi has learned that warm places to pass a winter\u2019s night include car park staircases, storm drains and tunnels. But the most pressing problem for the 26-year-old Brisbane woman on the nights she sleeps rough is what to do with her baby boy, Marcus. \u201cHe\u2019s a fucking genius,\u201d Paasi says. \u201cI gotta tell you man, he\u2019s the smartest one-and-a-bit-year-old I\u2019ve ever met. And he\u2019s a really well-behaved baby.\u201d Paasi\u2019s concern for Marcus, though, is that he has \u201cnever known what it is like to have his own room with his stuff in it\u201d, where he can go and have quiet time. \u201cHe has no routine,\u201d Paasi says. \u201cHe just has to get comfortable wherever we are, or wherever we\u2019re going in life.\u201d    For a time that included motel rooms but Paasi says that \u201cobviously just isn\u2019t affordable for anyone, especially homeless people\u201d. Mainly it involves surfing the couches of friends and relatives. On the nights she has to sleep rough, Paasi tries to leave Marcus with his paternal grandparents. However, it is often too uncomfortable for her to stay because Marcus\u2019s father, Paasi\u2019s partner of almost a decade, spends much of his time there.   Related: Queenslanders miss out on social housing due to failures to build homes and inaccurate waiting lists    \u201cOur relationship fell apart because we were so stressed and broke and homeless,\u201d Paasi says. \u201cHomelessness has literally fucked my whole life.\u201d Paasi is one of thousands of Queenslanders approved for social housing who have no house to go to. A report released this week by Queensland\u2019s auditor general, Brendan Worrall, found 30,922 households \u2013 more than 50,000 people \u2013 on the state\u2019s housing register, a figure which has grown by 78% since 2018. That figure might be inaccurate \u2013 which is only compounding the problem. Worrall found the state government was failing to keep an accurate waiting list and manage its existing stock. The biggest problem, though, is that they are not building enough homes.    Queensland\u2019s housing department continues to spruik the $2.9bn investment for social and affordable housing committed in the 2021 budget, which included $1bn towards a Housing Investment Fund. \u201cThis investment means we can house more vulnerable Queenslanders sooner,\u201d a spokesperson says. The government says it will start construction on 7,400 new homes by June 2025. Worrall\u2019s report, though, deemed those plans unlikely to cut the waiting list, likely to be exacerbated by rising interest rates and a tightening rental market.   Interactive   For many, it has been a long wait already. In Bradley Tull\u2019s case, it has been almost four years. The 43-year-old has spent most of that time in supported accommodation \u2013 a tough environment for a man like Tull. Since he was hit by a truck in the streets of Innisfail and acquired a brain injury 20 years ago, he has kept mostly to himself. \u201cIt was like being in a prison,\u201d Tull says of the shared living space. Tull recently moved to his own place in Mango Hill, currently covered by NDIS funding. It is an improvement, though too small to have his three boys \u2013 aged eight, six and four \u2013 stay over. But it is just the sort of thing Tull is hoping to have as long-term shelter.

I miss seeing my boys.\u201d But though Tull is stuck in limbo while the state grapples with a housing crisis, he is also testament to the life-changing power of government. NDIS funding and the daily visits from support workers make a \u201cvery big difference\u201d in Tull\u2019s life.

The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, confirmed there was \u201cscope for additional funding\u201d beyond the first four-year budget period, with the exact amount to depend on negotiations with the two countries.   Related: What is the Aukus submarine deal and what does it mean? \u2013 the key facts     In an interview with Guardian Australia, Conroy also warned it would be \u201ca grave mistake\u201d to assume the government-owned shipbuilder ASC would automatically get the contract to build the British-designed nuclear-powered submarines. The Albanese government continues to promise to build the submarines in Osborne in South Australia but Conroy said there was \u201creal scope to explore who is the best builder\u201d as part of a strategy to be developed over the next 12 to 18 months. The comments indicate a raft of decisions remain outstanding in the wake of the announcement in San Diego of a multi-decade plan for the US and the UK to help Australia acquire up to eight nuclear-powered submarines. This week Labor MPs started to question aspects of the program, including how to fund the projected overall cost of up to $368bn by the 2050s, prompting the Coalition to demand that Anthony Albanese \u201cunify his party\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  One of the most sensitive decisions relates to Australia offering about $3bn over the next four years to boost the submarine sustainment and production capacity of the other two Aukus countries \u2013 mostly the US. Conroy acknowledged the funding was \u201ccontroversial\u201d but said it would address \u201ccritical choke points\u201d in the US supply chain. This \u201cdownpayment\u201d would give the US confidence to sell Australia at least three Virginia-class submarines in the 2030s, with the option of a further two. \u201cThe only way the United States will support us buying Virginia-class submarines is [if] they have sufficient for their needs,\u201d he said. Conroy said these submarines were needed fill a capability gap that he blamed on \u201c10 years of chopping and changing\u201d under the Coalition, including the abandoned Japanese and French submarine options. When pressed, Conroy confirmed the government was likely to provide \u201cadditional funding\u201d to boost overseas production lines beyond the four-year budget period, known as the \u201cforward estimates\u201d. \u201cWe envisage that there\u2019ll be a small amount post-forward estimates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not disclosing it is [because] that is the area where there is further negotiation, both with the United States and the United Kingdom, but I can reiterate the vast majority of it is in the forward estimates.\u201d This would not represent a cost blowout because the further amount was already included in the $50bn to $58bn prediction for the entire Aukus project over the next 10 years, Conroy said. The final phase of the plan is to build the \u201cSSN-Aukus\u201d \u2013 a nuclear-powered submarine based on a British design and incorporating US technology \u2013 at the Osborne shipyard in Adelaide by a yet-to-be-selected company.   Related: Peter Garrett says nuclear submarine deal \u2018most costly and risky\u2019 action ever taken by an Australian government     \u201cI think that it\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019d have a full-blown competitive tender process where you\u2019re asking for something off-the-shelf, because this is a very niche thing to do, but there\u2019s a real scope to explore who is the best builder and there\u2019s plenty of options,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cBAE obviously build the British submarines. They could establish an Australian entity to build Australian submarines like they\u2019ve done for the Hunter-class frigates. There could be an alliance structure between ASC and one of those other builders, or the UK and US builders could come in on an alliance structure.\u201d The government\u2019s strategy is likely to involve an Osborne precinct-wide approach, with workers transferring between entities depending on production patterns of a range of projects, including the life-of-type extension of the Collins-class submarines, the Hunter-class frigates, and the SSN-Aukus. By transferring between projects, workers would also build up their skills. While construction of the SSN-Aukus is slated to start by the end of the 2020s, the first such boat will not be provided to the Royal Australian navy until the early 2040s. This would be about five years after the first UK-built SSN-Aukus was scheduled to enter into that county\u2019s service, in an attempt to reduce risk surrounding the new design, Conroy said. \u201cThe first of type of any new class, particularly a nuclear-powered submarine, is the riskiest \u2013 that\u2019s the one that is the hardest to deliver,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cHaving that half-a-decade gap will really give us a lot of comfort that we can iron out those problems.\u201d Conroy said Aukus was \u201ca huge national endeavour\u201d that would involve \u201ctraining thousands of Australians for these jobs\u201d.

As they were notoriously shy and skittish towards humans, often the closest he\u2019d get would be discovering faint traces of their paw prints in the sand near his campsite. By the next day, the wind would blow the tracks away, as if the animals were never really there to begin with. \u201cI\u2019ve been going [to K\u2019gari] since I was a one-year-old, and you almost never saw a dingo at all,\u201d Sinclair, now 53, says.     A few hours north of Brisbane, K\u2019gari, the world\u2019s largest sand island, remains an extraordinarily successful tourism destination, hosting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. In June, the island was stripped of its colonial name, Fraser Island, and restored to K\u2019gari, which means \u2018paradise\u2019 in the local Butchulla language. It\u2019s a fitting name for a stunning island that\u2019s home to spectacular sand blows, freshwater lakes and towering eucalyptus forests.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  For thousands of years, the Butchulla people coexisted with dingoes, which were brought over to K\u2019gari by Asian fishers. The \u201cwat\u2019dha\u201d or camp dingo were Butchulla companions, helping them hunt and protecting them from bad spirits. The \u201cwongari\u201d were wild dingoes that roamed the sweeping coastline hunting for wallabies, lizards and rodents. When the last Indigenous people were removed from the island, all the dingoes became wild.     But a string of recent dingo attacks has rangers worried the animals are no longer scared of humans and that tourist behaviour is causing escalations in their aggression. One particularly \u201chigh-risk\u201d animal was killed by injection on Wednesday after an attack on a 24-year-old woman who was hospitalised after being mauled by four dingoes while jogging down the beach.

Related: K\u2019gari dingo euthanised after pack attack that left young woman in hospital    A department of environment spokesperson said the dingo that was put down weighed 17 kilograms, \u201cwhich is heavy for a dingo and indicated it had been fed\u201d. \u201cIt was also clear from its behaviour that it had become habituated, either by being fed or from people interacting with it for videos and selfies.\u201d \u2018In the past they\u2019d never approach you\u2019 Sinclair\u2019s father, John, was a renowned local campaigner who spent decades on the successful fight to end sand mining and logging on the island before his death in 2019. Sinclair estimates he\u2019s visited the island hundreds of times and says he first detected a shift in dingo behaviour in the mid-90s. \u201cI was sitting on the beach observing one of the lakes, and a dingo came and walked around my picnic blanket. It was stalking me. It was quite disturbing,\u201d he said.    \u201cWe went for a swim and then it came down and just pulled the lid off the esky and grabbed some things and ran away.\u201d This year, a dingo ran towards Sinclair and his wife while they were taking photos of birds on the beach. \u201cIn the past, they\u2019d never approach you. But it\u2019s ridiculous the number of times I\u2019ve seen humans hand-feeding dingoes,\u201d he says. Nobody knows for sure exactly why attacks are becoming more frequent, but almost everyone Guardian Australia spoke to believes it is linked to the growth in tourism on the island. This week, two women were fined $2,300 each for taking selfies with the animals in a blatant breach of \u201cdingo safety\u201d protocol repeated at length in signage and brochures available to tourists on the island. Visitors are told never to walk alone, leave children unattended or go running. It\u2019s an offence to feed or intentionally attract or disturb the dingoes whose presence creates the authentic Australian experience many tourists seek.

If you go to Africa or the Rocky Mountains, you respect the fact that you\u2019re around wildlife that can kill you.\u201d Smith says people are ignorant to the danger of dingoes because they are small and puppy-like, prompting tourists to give them a \u201ccheeky bit of fruit\u201d to get a great photo.    \u201cThat might be a benign incident for you, but that\u2019s setting the scene for the future. It\u2019s like a death sentence for a dingo when you start feeding.\u201d Sinclair agrees. \u201cI hear people say all the time \u2018but I want to feed them because they\u2019re so skinny\u2019 \u2026 but dingoes are a naturally lean animal,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could literally feed them a lot of food and in a day they\u2019d be skinny again, like a greyhound.\u201d Sinclair believes there should be further enforcement of fines, and potentially a one- or two-strike rule implemented to exclude problem visitors from the island. K\u2019gari attracts two distinct types of tourists: those who head to the resorts and go on organised tours, and independent campers who relish the opportunity to take a four-wheel drive on the wide open sands. Since the pandemic, senior ranger Linda Behrendorff says she\u2019s seeing worsening behaviour from people who\u2019ve recently joined the latter group.    They\u2019ve recently bought their first four-wheel-drive and they\u2019re hitting nature reserves all across Queensland, often with too much alcohol, she says. And they won\u2019t be told the rules.  \u201cI\u2019ve actually booked someone for feeding once. Ticket in their hand, they looked me fair in the eye and went: \u2018It was worth it\u2019. \u201cWhat do you do with that?

It is estimated fewer than 200 remain. A spate of dingo attacks in 2019 saw the state roll out higher fines, and in 2021 a $2m fence stretching 7km was erected around the Orchid Beach township. Fencing is also in place around the Happy Valley and Eurong townships, as well as major camping spots. In response to questions about a repeat cull this week, the state government was resolute: it was not an option. In the past two months they\u2019ve euthanised two dingoes, the first since 2019.

Their future viability depends on keeping a healthy population. Seymour says nobody locally has called for a cull, with residents aware of the small dingo population\u2019s unbroken heritage. \u201cThat population is a national treasure and needs to be protected and preserved. The greatest risk to it is human habituation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re much more likely to be in a car accident, \u2026 eaten by a shark, [and] to drown than be attacked by a dingo.\u201d Cheryl Bryant from Save Fraser Island Dingoes says the government should consider capping tourist numbers during peak holiday periods to keep both dingoes and tourists safe. \u201cThe island, the east coast, gets saturated with tourists.

And despite the huge social harms attributed to gambling, even the total claimed community benefit was often as little as 25% of the money lost by gamblers.   Interactive   A spokesperson from RSL Victoria said RSLs received minimal government support and that \u201cfunding for our support of veterans and their families throughout Victoria comes from two sources: our community appeals and commercial operations\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re not doing nothing,\u201d said Louise Francis, a gambling researcher and PhD candidate at Monash University, \u201cbut they could be doing so much more for the community and the community potentially don\u2019t realise \u2026 how much they\u2019re not seeing the proceeds from gambling.\u201d   Related: The cost of losing the politics of pokies in the gaming machine capital of Australia    Francis\u2019s research between 2012 and 2015 found claimed community benefits to be \u201covervalued\u201d, with up to 82% consisting of wages, venue maintenance, capital costs and utilities, and just 4.5% of expenditure going to charitable and philanthropic purposes. She said the issue was prevalent across the country, except in Western Australia, where poker machines are restricted to the casino. Guardian Australia looked at the yearly statements of 55 Victorian RSLs registered with the gaming commission. The findings were consistent with Francis\u2019s research, with wages making up between 40% and 60% of claimed community benefits for most Victorian RSLs over the past five years, where data is available. The statements break community benefit into three classes: A, B and C. The data shows the vast majority of spending goes to class B, \u201cindirect\u201d expenditure that includes operating costs such as wages and utilities. Many RSLs do not claim any spending on activities to address gambling harm (class C) despite earning millions in gambling revenue.   Interactive   Many clubs saw a large increase in their relative community benefit in 2020 and 2021, when gambling revenues declined. Even clubs with much higher ratios of community benefit to gambling revenue may not necessarily have spent more on donations or sponsorships.

One example is wages, which are often the largest line items in the community benefit statements. Some clubs employ counsellors for their veteran members.

The ombudsman said that \u201ceven to the untrained eye\u201d the signatures on two forms she was supposed to have signed were different. \n An Aboriginal woman with diabetes, a hearing impairment and an intellectual disability, and who could not read or write except to sign her name, told the ombudsman the representative completed some forms and got her to sign them without explaining them to her. She did not know which documents she signed and could not understand the documents she was given, as she could not read. \n A 52-year-old Aboriginal man was at his sister\u2019s house in May 2007 when encouraged to sign up to ACBF. The ombudsman noted inconsistencies in the paperwork: \u201cI note the application form is dated 2 June 2007, has a witness signature dated 18 May 2007, and is signed by a consultant dated 25 May 2007.\u201d \n \nIn each case, the ombudsman found that ACBF should repay the clients all that they had paid into the fund, plus interest. \nGuardian Australia has spoken to policyholders who say that even as the fund was collapsing in March 2022, it continued to give them inconsistent information. \nGamilaroi woman Kayla Lawton looks set to lose the $10,000 of premiums in the ACBF collapse.

Labor had been highly critical of the Coalition government\u2019s decision to change the NBN from the planned fibre-to-the-premises model to a multi-technology mix model that used the existing and ageing copper network. The new model enabled more homes to be connected to the NBN faster, but Australia\u2019s internet speeds have languished as a result.   Related: Short runways and Faustian pacts \u2013 a tough balancing act for Labor ahead of the budget    Improving the NBN became a key election commitment, with Labor using data-mapping it had insisted become part of Coalition 2020 legislation to help identify key areas to target in the hustings. On Tuesday the government will announce the expansion of full-fibre access to 1.5m premises by 2025 with a $2.4bn equity investment over four years. People who have copper connections will have the choice of having a full-fibre connection instead, which will deliver faster internet speeds, with regional Australia one of the first beneficiaries.

In South Australia Mount Gambier and Renmark are among the regions highlighted to share in 120,000 upgrades and in Tasmania, where 45,000 premises will receive the offer, the communities of Huonville and Old Beach make the list. Upgrade works will also begin in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, where more than 9,000 additional connections will be made.

Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that an economic analysis, commissioned by local environmental groups, found the Urannah project could return as little as 26c for every dollar invested. A subsequent Guardian investigation found that $12m in federal funding announced since 2018 ultimately flowed to Bowen River Utilities, which is run by prominent Queensland Liberal National party figures and donors.   Related: Proposed $2.9bn Urannah dam in Queensland could return as little as 26c per dollar    The Australian reported the $500m grant would go to that same company. The sole director of Bowen River Utilities is John Cotter Jr, a former member of the LNP\u2019s governing state executive and a former regional party chair. Under a complicated corporate structure, subsidiary companies of Bowen River Utilities are run by people who include two LNP donors. The suite of companies proposing the Urannah scheme were \u2013 until July 2019 \u2013 previously mostly owned by Initiative Capital, a venture specialising in public-private partnerships that is owned by Cotter and his wife, Regina. Profiles of Bowen River Utilities staff on LinkedIn previously listed their employer as Initiative Capital. Guardian Australia makes no suggestion Bowen River Utilities or any associated individual has acted improperly, or that the company and its proposal should not be eligible to receive federal grant funding. Cotter was quoted by the Australian \u2013 which did not mention his or the company\u2019s LNP connections \u2013 as saying the $2.9bn dam would be able to provide water to coalmines in the Bowen Basin, supply water for irrigation and would include a pumped hydro-electric scheme. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, on Thursday said the $483 million investment in the 970 gigalitre dam project would help nearby producers develop 20,000 hectares of irrigated land, and deliver more infrastructure to regional centres such as Mackay and Gladstone. But studies have raised serious questions as to whether the project carries the sort of economic benefit suggested. A preliminary business case for Urannah, submitted to the Queensland government in 2019, claimed the project would return a benefit of $1.70 for every dollar invested. It is understood a final business case has been developed but that it has not been released publicly. A review of the preliminary business case by an economist, Andrew Buckwell of Altus Impact, found the benefits were significantly overstated, based on \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d and did not take into account environmental costs, including additional carbon emissions created by the inundation of 6,099 hectares of forest. The economic assessment was commissioned by the Mackay Conservation Group. In each of five scenarios modelled by Buckwell, the project was measured as having a net social cost to the community. In the worst-case scenario, the total benefit of Urannah was equivalent to about a quarter of the cost. \u201cFrom an economic perspective, the construction of the Urannah Dam should not be supported,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cIt will come at a net social cost to the community. \u201cFrom a policy perspective, the construction of the Urannah Dam should not be supported. It will not achieve the stated goals of cost recovery from water users.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   While much of the public discussion about Urannah has focused on how the project might boost local agriculture, the bulk of any water transported to Moranbah would be used for coalmining. Documents submitted by Bowen River Utilities to the federal government for environmental assessment show it has consulted major coalmine operators in the Bowen Basin about buying water from Urannah. \u201cCommunity and stakeholder consultation has been targeted and conducted at a regional level as part of the feasibility studies for the project,\u201d the referral document says. \u201cThe focus of stakeholder engagement, to date, has been on water infrastructure and potential customers of a large-scale water solution. Consultation with the following stakeholders has been undertaken \u2026 Rio Tinto, Glencore, QCoal, New Hope, BMA, Peabody, Anglo American, Stanmore, Fitzroy Resources.\u201d Bowen River Utilities chief executive officer James Benjamin said in a statement: \u201cOur detailed business case has been completed by top-tier advisors in line with best practice for government infrastructure requirements. \u201cOur DBC has now been released by the Queensland Government and is available to the public and highlights the vast benefits to the Greater Whitsunday Region, North Queensland more broadly and taxpayers. \u201cOnce built, Urannah Dam will be handed back to the Queensland Government as a public asset. \u201cWe are currently completing our environmental approvals in line with the stringent process for major projects in Queensland. \u201cWe welcome the overwhelming support we\u2019ve had from the local community in response to the announcement from the Coalition Government this morning. \u201cUrannah Dam will transform the region with water security and reliable energy and is strongly supported by both major political parties and all three levels of Government.\u201d", "Morning mail: 200,000 robodebt reviews wiped, G7 leaders warn Putin over nuclear threat, Bali bombings remembered [2022-10-11T19:59:00Z]": "Good morning.

Guy characterised the premier, Daniel Andrews, as an \u201carrogant and unchecked\u201d leader, who would send Victoria \u201cbroke\u201d as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns, cost overruns on major projects and record debt levels. \u201cWhat we are living today is the handiwork of long-term Labor and a long-term premier. A man whose ego says, \u2018I need to be here longer than Bracks\u2019 \u2013 his ego says, \u2018I need to be here longer than Kennett\u2019,\u201d he told parliament\u2019s lower house on Thursday. \u201cA man motivated by a bronze statue of himself and not motivated by fixing the many problems he and his government have caused.\u201d Guy was referring to the statues outside Treasury Place, awarded to Victorian premiers who had led the state for 3,000 days or more. If Andrews wins a third election in November and serves until next May he will qualify for one, though he has said he has given no thought to the matter. The speech criticised the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, including failures in hotel quarantine and decisions to close playgrounds, impose curfews and separate metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria at various stages. \u201cWhile this horror played out and people were dying \u2026 the government\u2019s focus was, of course, on itself. Covid management to this government was about PR management first and health second,\u201d Guy said. He repeatedly referred to the government as a \u201cone man show\u201d and \u201cDan show\u201d, in an apparent reference to the daily press conferences held during the state\u2019s second wave of Covid-19. \u201cThat hectoring voice, it\u2019s driven us all mad for far too long. We all want to change the channel,\u201d Guy said.   Related: Bid to compulsorily harvest medical records to meet opposition in Victoria\u2019s parliament    Treasurer Tim Pallas\u2019s eighth budget, handed down last week, committed $12bn to repairing the healthcare system, which the government says has suffered as a result of Covid-19. The budget also outlined a path to a modest surplus in 2025/26, though debt will rise to a record $167.5bn in the same financial year. Guy said Victoria was on track to have the equivalent debt to New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia combined. \u201cNow that\u2019s a special kind of recklessness. Who would have thought that in 2014 when the government changed and Labor came to office, and debt levels were around $20bn, that we\u2019d be genuinely looking at putting another zero on that within two terms of office? And let\u2019s not believe the lie that it was all for Covid,\u201d he said. While not unveiling any new election promises, Guy repeated commitments outlined earlier this year, including a commitment to no longer impose lockdowns, fix the state\u2019s healthcare and mental health \u201ccrisis\u201d and slash hospital waiting lists, cut the cost of living and build an infectious disease hospital.

An expert panel responds [2022-11-04T19:00:31Z]": "This week, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he would not be pushing for payments for households to deal with the rising costs of energy, groceries and other financial pressures, because to do so would risk further inflation.  The easy option would have been for us to funnel these savings straight into a cash-splash, a one-off giveaway to buy a headline. Cheap politics and hugely expensive economics.Not just because of the dollar cost. Not just because that\u2019s \u00adexactly the sort of short-term \u00adapproach that got Australia into this situation. But because the \u00aduntargeted spending would make the problem worse.Instead of helping households, it would only add to the inflationary pressures that are eating away at family budgets and devaluing wages. Fiscal policy needs to work with monetary policy, not contradict it.  But is all relief necessarily inflationary? What if cost-of-living payments are targeted at low-income earners or people on welfare payments? Can the government help households without hiking inflation? Prof John Quiggin University of Queensland, Laureate fellow The economic situation facing the majority of Australian households is dire. However, the common framing of the problem in terms of the \u201ccost of living\u201d distracts attention from the real problem, which is the decline in the real purchasing power of wages. Having remained stagnant for years, wages have now fallen far behind inflation. Moreover, the average rate of tax paid is rising because of bracket creep and because of the expiry of the Morrison government\u2019s low- and middle-income tax offset, which was not extended in the October budget.    Under our current policy approach, economic welfare is declining    Neither of these outcomes is likely to improve significantly during the current term of government. The budget papers predict a further decline in real wages this year, and only a partial recovery over subsequent years. And while those on high incomes will benefit from the stage-three tax cuts, there is nothing for those on incomes below $45,000. Even the indexation increases in pensions and benefits lag behind inflation by six months. In response to this crisis, Albanese has said, in effect, that his hands are tied. First, he denounces relief for low-income earners as \u201ca cash-splash, a one-off giveaway to buy a headline. Cheap politics and hugely expensive economics\u201d. But the same is true, in spades, of the massive stage-three tax cuts, which Labor promised to implement for fear of losing a few marginal high-income voters. If the stage-three tax cuts had been cancelled or deferred in the October budget, Labor would have had room to improve the position of the worst-off voters, while maintaining a broadly stable ratio of debt to GDP. But Labor was too frightened of negative headlines to grasp this nettle. Albanese\u2019s other argument is that any expansionary fiscal policy would be cancelled out by the RBA, which would raise the interest rate. He observed that \u201cfiscal policy needs to work with monetary policy, not contradict it\u201d.   Related: Reserve Bank predicts inflation to peak at 8% \u2013 the highest rate since 1990    There\u2019s an element of truth here, but also a huge problem. As well as maintaining price stability, the RBA is supposed to act to achieve full employment and \u201cthe economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\u201d. But under our current policy approach, economic welfare is declining. Unemployment is expected to rise, and real disposable incomes to fall, even in a situation where GDP is growing steadily. Under the policy of central bank independence, first introduced under the Howard government, there is nothing that can be done about this. The Reserve Bank pursues its inflation target without regard to the policies of the elected government. But this policy has not served Australia, or other countries that have followed this course, at all well. It was necessarily abandoned during both the GFC and the Covid lockdown. If fiscal policy must work with monetary policy, the reverse should also hold true. It is clear enough that our current economic policy institutions are not fit for purpose. Sadly, that includes the policies of the Albanese government. Angela Jackson Lead economist, Impact Economics and Policy While it is accurate that any additional cost-of-living support would increase aggregate demand across the economy and add to inflationary pressures, if properly targeted these impacts can be minimised, and need to be weighed against the costs of placing more and more Australians into extreme poverty. Poverty itself is costly in terms of increasing rates of poor mental and physical health that reduces participation and productivity, increasing inflationary pressures through reducing the productive capacity of the economy. Our system automatically provides some protection, with government income support payments indexed every six months to inflation. However, for people relying on government support payments that already placed them in poverty that are now facing double digit increases in rent and energy prices, this is not enough to cover their rising living costs.    Protecting the most vulnerable should remain our collective priority    Countries around the world are grappling with how to support communities struggling under higher costs of living while not adding to inflation. The International Monetary Fund has advised countries to prioritise protecting vulnerable people through targeted support while keeping a tight fiscal stance to help fight inflation. This advice highlights the need for fiscal policy to protect low-income households from higher food, energy and housing costs. The Albanese government should certainly not emulate the Morrison budget of March 2022, which provided untargeted and arguably reckless cost-of-living relief that fuelled inflation and made the Reserve Bank\u2019s job of controlling inflation much harder. But the government should consider targeted relief for the lowest income households, consistent with the advice from the International Monetary Fund. Examples include lifting the maximum rate of rent assistance or a temporary increase in the energy supplement, which would help households with their week-to-week costs and be less inflationary than large one-off payments that provide a greater stimulus to the economy. Managing the economy back on to a low-inflation path without causing a recession and widespread hardship will not be easy, but protecting the most vulnerable should remain our collective priority to minimise the long-term impacts on our economy and community. Stephen Koukoulas Managing director, Market Economics A significant part of the extreme inflation problem relates to the economy overheating \u2013 growing too quickly, in other words. Growth in government demand was an important part of this excessive growth.    If there was an intention to assist low-income earners, the government ... would need to find spending or tax offsets    The near 50-year low for the unemployment rate of 3.5% and GDP growth set to hit 6% are a legacy of easy monetary policy and reckless fiscal policy in late 2021 and early 2022. With its series of interest rate rises since May, the RBA is taking away the monetary policy stimulus. Fiscal policy, which was materially eased by the Morrison government, including in its pre-election budget in March 2022 when the inflation problems were being unleashed, needs to keep moving to a more neutral setting to take some of the heat out of the economy \u2013 to slow it down, in other words. A return to low inflation is the only sustainable way cost-of-living pressures can be contained. Handing out cash to households would have the effect of supporting already strong spending which would allow and encourage business to easily pass on higher prices, adding to inflation.   Related: Energy price relief plan due before Christmas, Jim Chalmers tells ABC\u2019s Q+A    Under the current strategy, it is likely inflation will fall towards the RBA target during 2023 at a time when wages growth will probably lift to 4%. This is the path to reversing cost of living concerns. Cash handouts would keep inflation higher for longer. It would also damage the already fragile budget deficit and it would mean the RBA would need to hike interest rates more than it would otherwise. Equity and fairness issues relating to the financial pressure for low-income earners can be addressed in a revenue/stimulus-neutral way. If there was an intention to assist low-income earners, the government at a minimum would need to find spending or tax offsets elsewhere ensuring at worst a neutral impact on demand and inflation. The opportunity to do this remains in place but could face the obvious political difficulty of imposing tax increases or spending cuts to some in the economy to fund any financial assistance for low income earners.", "Funding shortfalls force Melbourne legal centre to stop taking calls on police misconduct [2022-10-10T00:22:39Z]": "A Victorian community legal centre that specialises in police misconduct matters has stopped taking calls from the public because of funding shortfalls amid calls for the Andrews government to establish a new police watchdog. The Police Accountability Project, which is based at Inner Melbourne Community Legal Centre, is only taking on new clients referred to it by other lawyers and the most egregious cases, as it can no longer operate a phone intake line that had previously serviced as many as 400 people a year. Previous callers to the centre would generally be given a telephone appointment of an hour to discuss their cases, and about one in 10 callers were taken on as clients, but the line was recently closed amid uncertainty regarding the project\u2019s funding. The centre relies on federal, state and philanthropic funding. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity for people to take those calls,\u201d Gregor Husper, the project\u2019s principal solicitor, said. \u201cIf we had funding stability, we could reopen the line.

Related: Journalists at foreign-owned outlets in Australia could face jail for exposing ADF war crimes, paper suggests     The letter, signed by 29 organisations including community legal centres, private legal providers, academics from the University of NSW and Aboriginal service providers, says that a police ombudsman would be able to properly investigate all complaints about police misconduct and systemic failings. The current model of police oversight is under review, but the state government appears highly unlikely to announce significant reforms to the sector before November\u2019s state election. The letter said police should no longer investigate police and that the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) should be stripped of its current police oversight role in favour of the ombudsman model. Their letter said any oversight system must be truly independent, well-resourced, complainant-centred and culturally appropriate, fair, accountable and transparent, able to achieve timely and fair outcomes, and promote systemic change. \u201cThe systemic failings of Victoria police have seriously diminished the Victorian community\u2019s confidence in the organisation,\u201d it said. Nerita Waight, the chief executive of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and the spokesperson for the coalition, said that Ibac had found that more than half the time Aboriginal people make police complaints the force ignored relevant evidence. \u201cAboriginal people are more likely to suffer police misconduct, but less likely to make a complaint \u2013 our community knows that the system doesn\u2019t take their complaints seriously.\u201d Kirsty Mac, a Melbourne woman whose own police complaint took five years to resolve, backed calls for a new approach. In 2014, she was at a suburban train station when protective services officers (PSOs) asked to see her ticket. Despite travelling with a valid ticket, she says she was verbally and physically abused by the PSOs, who arrested her after she questioned why she needed to provide them with identification. Police did not uphold her complaint and neither did Ibac, but the force settled a civil complaint she made in 2019, the details of which are confidential. The lengthy period between when she made her complaint and when her civil case was settled caused her severe mental anguish, she said. \u201cIt got worse as time went on. The more I had to deal with legal things, I got more and more unwell,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m a middle-class white lady.

The prime minister travelled to Brisbane on Monday campaigning on the commonwealth\u2019s $667m investment in the south-east Queensland city deal, primarily for transport projects, ahead of the federal budget on 29 March.

The victory is the first loss in Australia of an incumbent government since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to warnings that Morrison had damaged the Liberal brand in the state, and that a bigger agenda for the next term of government could trump pandemic management in voters\u2019 minds. Morrison told reporters in Brisbane the government was \u201cvery conscious of cost-of-living impacts, particularly at the moment, with the war in Ukraine and the impact that that is especially having on fuel prices\u201d. He argued high fuel prices, which have hit $2.20 in some parts of Australia, \u201cdon\u2019t just hit the economy and hit family budgets when they fill up, but they have a knock-on effect across the economy\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been carefully considering our response to ensure that we can deliver a budget that both addresses those immediate needs but also ensures that we continue on with our strong economic plan for a stronger economy.\u201d Earlier, Morrison told 4BC radio that the spike in petrol prices \u201cwon\u2019t go forever\u201d and the government would not engage in a \u201ckneejerk\u201d response, suggesting that any move to reduce excise, which adds 44.2 cents to the price of petrol, would be temporary.

An independent fund is seen as a cornerstone of the state\u2019s treaty architecture, and the call by Gallagher comes after Victoria\u2019s parliament last week passed a landmark bill to create the nation\u2019s first treaty authority body. The body will act as an independent umpire to oversee treaty negotiations and resolve disputes between First Nations groups and the state government.

Related: Australia has second wettest spring on record, with parts of country coldest in decades    Jess Jeffery, 27, her partner, Aaron, and their young son had been living in the garage attached to her mum\u2019s house about 25 minutes\u2019 drive out of Rochester while they looked for rental properties. About $15,000 worth of furniture and belongings they had stored in a shipping container in Rochester was destroyed in the recent floods, but because they have no fixed address, they have been excluded from receiving any flood relief from the state government, Jeffery said. \u201cFor the last eight months, we\u2019ve been basically without our own home. We\u2019ve been living in Tongala with my mother,\u201d she said.    \u201cWhen we moved into my mum\u2019s, everything went into storage in Rochester.\u201d In early October, almost the whole town was decimated by floods, leaving one person dead, and hundreds of homes inundated. Jeffery is on the disability support pension and her partner works part-time. They lost almost everything they owned in the container. \u201cAll our furniture got destroyed; the water was sitting in there for four days. We\u2019ve lost clothes, my son\u2019s lost toys, kitchenware, a pram, treasured memories from childhood like collectible bears,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s tearing me apart.\u201d The only help Jeffery has been able to get is vouchers from the Salvation Army \u2013 worth $350 for the whole family. Without emergency funding, the family have no idea how they will replace their belongings. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for the funding through the DHHS website, and I told them our entire situation,\u201d Jeffery said. \u201cI was told we should do it \u2026 but we aren\u2019t eligible.\u201d To date, the department has made more than 22,724 payments to flood-affected residents totalling $18.6m. People who apply for the payments must prove they live in a flood-affected address by showing some form of identification.    Services Australia is administering the commonwealth\u2019s one-off relief payment of $1,000 per adult, and despite Jeffery being on the DSP, they have not been able to access that either. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing said they would contact the family to offer assistance. \u201cWe are working hard to get flood-affected Victorians the help and support they need, including with Personal Hardship Assistance Program payments,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe department will contact this family to seek options for support that might best fit their personal circumstances.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Jeffery says with the weather warming up, the garage at her mum\u2019s house has become unliveable. The family have applied for more than 30 rental properties in the last month across the central north area, but they have not heard back from any. They are currently staying in a motel, but cannot afford to live there for much longer.    \u201cWe have a dog and toddler \u2013 two little messes. That turns people off having us,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m putting all of this in the rental application but it\u2019s like they don\u2019t give a shit. The toll it takes continuously being knocked back, what it does, is just unreal. \u201cThen to have the floods on top of it, that was the last thing I needed to deal with.\u201d Mike Phillips, state manager for housing at VincentCare, the specialised housing provider for St Vincent de Paul Society Victoria, said there was a shortage of housing in the area before the floods. \u201cFor example, in Shepparton in mid-2022, there were more than 2,000 approved eligible people on the Victorian Housing Register,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cPeople who were already listed on the VHR will now be in competition with anyone displaced by the flooding, adding to that pressure.   Related: Body of 19-year-old man found in NSW four days after he vanished in flood waters    \u201cThose who are particularly vulnerable, have specific needs or low incomes, are most likely to struggle to find suitable accommodation. Those who had been longtime renters in flood-affected properties may find the reality of current rental prices in any available private rental properties a shock.\u201d Jeffery was put on the waitlist for the Victorian Housing Register but was told it would be four years until they were offered a home. The chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons, Jenny Smith, said to meet demand across the state the Victorian government would need to invest in 60,000 social housing properties statewide over the next 10 years \u2013 especially in areas that are prone to natural disasters. \u201cThis shows exactly why Victoria needs more social housing, with an immediate priority placed on building homes in affected areas like Shepparton and the northern region of the state.\u201cThe state government has provided money to meet people\u2019s immediate accommodation needs. \u201cBut damaged homes, damaged social housing, and damaged emergency accommodation won\u2019t come back on board for months or years. We need to learn from this experience and make sure we are much better prepared for our next natural disaster.\u201d", "NSW environmental offsets scheme risks \u2018trading away\u2019 threatened species \u2018for cash\u2019, inquiry finds [2022-11-24T06:58:13Z]": "A New South Wales government environmental offsets scheme allows too much flexibility for threatened species to be \u201ctraded away for cash\u201d and should be reformed to ensure offsetting is \u201cgenuinely used as a last resort only\u201d, a parliamentary inquiry has found. Triggered after reporting by Guardian Australia, the inquiry found multiple problems with the scheme, including \u201cserious flaws in its design and operation that raise fundamental questions about whether it can achieve the stated goal of \u2018no net loss\u2019 of biodiversity\u201d. In theory, offsets should compensate for the destruction of habitat caused by development by protecting and improving equivalent habitat elsewhere.   Related: Flaws in Australia\u2019s carbon credits schemes undermine transparency, new report finds    But a series of stories by Guardian Australia revealed serious problems, including offsets that were promised but never delivered, so-called double-dipping on already protected land and conflict of interest concerns. In a report tabled Thursday, the NSW Greens-led inquiry found that rather than being a last resort, the scheme made it too easy for developers to make a cash payment to a fund administered by the state\u2019s Biodiversity Conservation Trust with \u201cno guarantee that like-for-like offsets will ever be found\u201d. It found the state\u2019s biodiversity market, which allows the trade of species and ecosystem credits, \u201cdoes not appear to be working for anyone\u201d, with developers facing uncertainty over the cost of offsets and whether the necessary credits would be available, and landowners not finding enough incentive to enter the scheme. \u201cThese issues with the scheme\u2019s operation, coupled with a lack of transparency, have led to a perception of many stakeholders that the scheme is profiting a few while failing to deliver meaningful protection for biodiversity,\u201d the report said. The committee\u2019s chair, Greens MLC Sue Higginson, said reform of the scheme was \u201cessential if we are to turn back the tide of destruction and prevent extinction of even more native species\u201d. Labor\u2019s environment spokesperson, Penny Sharpe, said NSW had a biodiversity crisis and the tool the government was relying on was \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d. \u201cThis inquiry has shone a light on how the scheme is failing and provides a cross-party consensus on what needs to be done to fix it. \u201cI urge the NSW government to take its recommendations seriously. If elected in March, Labor will require the recommendations of this review to be addressed as part of the long overdue statutory review of [the] Biodiversity Conservation Act.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Jacqui Mumford, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said the report \u201cbuilds on a growing body of evidence that the scheme is deeply flawed, lacks transparency and is riddled with loopholes\u201d. She said the scheme\u2019s design should be overhauled. The committee made 19 recommendations, which include establishing clear thresholds for when offsets should not be permitted for ecosystems and species that were so threatened that damage to their habitat was impossible to offset. It called for a review of some of the methods used to calculate environmental gains at offsets sites, and said counting rehabilitation of mining sites towards offsets for mining companies should be banned entirely. It suggested more stringent criteria be established for developer payments to the BCT\u2019s fund as well as continued review of the management of conflicts of interest within the biodiversity market. While the committee said it had no evidence of actual wrongdoing by environmentalconsultants who Guardian Australia previously reported made windfall gains fromthe scheme, it found that the case did illustrate that when there is insufficienttransparency in the scheme, including how potential conflicts of interest aremanaged, it is \u201copen to the perception of collusion or insider trading betweenconsultants, their clients and/or the authorities managing it\u201d. The committee said there were multiple areas of the scheme in which conflicts ofinterest could arise and recommended the planning and environment departmentcontinue to review arrangements for managing conflicts of interest, in addition toimprovements already made over the past year.   Related: Australia risks being a \u2018state sponsoring greenwashing\u2019 if it relies on carbon offsets, expert warns    The committee acknowledged the government had done some work in the past 18 months to make improvements to the offset scheme. The NSW environment minister, James Griffin, said he welcomed the report and would respond in due course. The government\u2019s response is due on 24 February 2023. \u201cSince taking on the responsibility for this scheme in December last year, I\u2019ve tasked my department with making improvements to ensure it meets expectations, with a focus on improving integrity, transparency and supporting participation in the scheme,\u201d he said. Government members of the committee wrote a dissenting report saying the work to improve the scheme, as well as several other recent inquiries, had not been fully acknowledged in the findings. That work included a new assurance program for the scheme with an independent monitor, including ecological monitoring requirements in all offset site agreements, and starting work on a record system for offset obligations. They said the report also minimised evidence from officials, failed to give a balanced presentation of stakeholder evidence and contained \u201cfactual errors\u201d, particularly in relation to the role of the BCT. Guardian Australia\u2019s reporting triggered several internal reviews by the government. The state\u2019s auditor general also brought forward a review of the scheme. In a report delivered in August, the auditor found the scheme was failing to protect some of the state\u2019s most endangered species and ecosystems and is riddled with integrity and transparency concerns. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2022 to make clear that the report of the parliamentary inquiry into the integrity of the NSW biodiversity offsets scheme said it had no evidence of actual wrongdoing by environmental consultants.", "\u2018Stunning pay rise\u2019: commodity boom to fuel improved Australian budget [2022-03-20T19:49:16Z]": "Soaring commodity prices and a shrinking jobless rate will combine to slice almost $90bn from projected federal budget deficits out to 2024-25, although excessive pre-election promises would undermine the government\u2019s fiscal repair efforts, according to Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte. The predicted improvement compares with forecasts in the government\u2019s mid-year outlook (Myefo) released last December. The current year\u2019s deficit alone will be cut almost a third from a projected $99.2bn to $69bn as the economy\u2019s rebound from Covid disruptions quickens, Richardson said. The falling unemployment rate \u2013 now at its lowest since 2008 \u2013 is helping to lift tax revenues and reduce welfare payments. However, about half of the improvement in the budget outlook stems from the commodity price surge, further increased by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions.   Related: Australia may be far from Ukraine but we won\u2019t avoid the economic fallout of war    \u201cThe world is giving us a stunning pay rise,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we have recovered faster and better than expected \u2013 it\u2019s that the world is handing us money at a rate we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d Deloitte predicts the deficits out to 2024-25 will be $87.6bn smaller than the Myefo forecasts. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who will present his fourth budget on 29 March, said on Friday \u201cthe time for large-scale economic stimulus is behind us\u201d, and that \u201cfiscal settings need to be normalised\u201d as part of the government\u2019s fiscal strategy. A looming election, though, meant a rising risk of extravagant spending, particularly by a government that was trailing badly in the polls, as the Morrison government is. \u201cIt\u2019s a danger period, as we know from history,\u201d Richardson said, citing promises by the Howard government for big tax cuts in 2007 and the Rudd government\u2019s national disability insurance scheme in 2013, that had long-lasting budget effects. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to be looking at something as big as either of those past experiences, but it\u2019s certainly risky,\u201d he said. Any normalisation of finances should include dropping the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO) that was meant as a temporary relief and has now doubled to $1080 a year for those eligible. Dubbed \u201clamington\u201d for its LMITO acronym, the $8bn offset is scheduled to end in June unless extended, although the government may be wary of scrapping it before the election.   Related: A pre-election splurge: what lamingtons have to do with tax cuts    The benefits, though, amount to \u201cmiddle-class welfare\u201d as it excludes the half of Australia\u2019s adult population that doesn\u2019t pay income taxes, such as retirees, students or those on salaries too low to pay personal tax, Richardson said. Modelling by Deloitte also indicates the injection of $8bn in the present economic state would trigger action by the Reserve Bank to quell the inflationary consequences, requiring an increase in the cash rate of 0.3 percentage points. The cash rate is currently at a record low 0.1% with the central bank now saying a rate rise this year is \u201cplausible\u201d as inflationary pressures mount. Investors and some banks predict a move by July or sooner. Longer term, Deloitte expects the government will spend more than currently forecast for areas such as social service, the NDIS and defence. To meet those costs, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to save out of the budget something like 2% of national income a year, or about $40bn\u201d, Richardson said. \u201cThe economics of it is entirely doable, the politics of it is entirely disastrous.\u201d Frydenberg said the Deloitte forecast was \u201ca further vote of confidence in Australia\u2019s economic resilience, noting \u2018Australia\u2019s economy is booming\u2019\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s economy has outperformed all major advanced economies since the pandemic began in both employment and output terms with our recovery stronger than that seen in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan,\u201d he said. Jim Chalmer, Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer and Katy Gallagher, the shadow finance minister, welcomed the predicted deficit narrowing, but said the government \u201cwon\u2019t take responsibility for a trillion dollars in debt or falling real wages\u201d. \u201cThe Coalition is showing all the signs of yet another budget full of secret slush funds before the election and secret cuts after it,\u201d they said in a statement.

The latter was \u201cnot necessarily a terrible outcome from the budgetary perspective, ironically, because inflation means higher prices, and that means there\u2019s more revenue\u201d, he said. So far, the major political parties have avoided major spending commitments, at least compared with the same stage ahead of the 2019 election. \u201cThis is not a time to be over-stimulating the economy,\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cThe economy\u2019s been humming along quite nicely, and inflation is a growing issue and a growing risk.\u201d Thorpe shared Richardson\u2019s view that it was \u201chard to believe in an election year\u201d the government would dump the LMITO despite it originally being meant to be temporary. \u201cPensions, disability support, rental assistance \u2013 there\u2019s a range of mechanisms that you might start to think of, if you\u2019re really trying to target the most vulnerable,\u201d he said.To prepare for the future, when prices for commodities such as iron ore and coal drop, the government should use the budget to prepare the economy for the next generation of industries. \u201cHow do we support green, cheap hydrogen or solar, \u2026 or extracting critical minerals and leveraging that into battery technology, rather than iron ore and coal?\u201d Thorpe said. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on what we\u2019ve done over the past 10 years to sustain a high level of growth going forward.\u201d \u201cWe project that the Commonwealth budget will not return to balance until 2036-37,\u201d he said.", "This is a budget of no surprises \u2013 designed to be sober, to build trust in the hope of better things to come | Katharine Murphy [2022-10-25T08:59:46Z]": "The Albanese government has an unofficial mantra. No sudden movements. Don\u2019t surprise the voters. You can think of this as a special bequest from the artist formerly known as the prime minister of Great Britain, Liz Truss. In scary times (and the budget papers confirm scary are the times we live in) being crazy brave, or in the Truss case just plain crazy, can get you killed. The first Labor budget in nine years models the in-house mantra. Most of the budget measures and forecasts were pre-briefed to the media in orderly fashion over a couple of weeks. One bauble was held back for budget night \u2013 a new housing policy commitment \u2013 but that leaked right at the last moment.   Related: Federal budget 2022: Jim Chalmers heralds budget of \u2018restraint\u2019 while warning of risks ahead for households    So, the no surprises government delivered the no surprises budget. The core of the strategy was simple. The Reserve Bank has a big job to do to subdue inflation. Stay out of the way. Staying out of the way meant no cash handouts for people battling cost of living pressure. Applying the brakes to discretionary spending. Banking as much of the temporary revenue windfall as possible to hedge against things falling apart. This budget is about a new government starting as it means to continue, then crossing its fingers and toes and touching wood and hoping that continuing like that is actually possible. Events have a habit of cruelling the best-laid plans.  When Jim Chalmers last sat in the treasurer\u2019s office \u2013 as an adviser, not the front man \u2013 Labor won the election in 2007, and then set to work dealing with a much less serious inflation challenge that had emerged in the closing years of the Howard government. Chalmers recounts this period in an engaging memoir published in 2013 called Glory Daze. Inflation was a genuine issue for the new Rudd government to manage, but it was also an excellent guardrail when it came to managing the ambitions of colleagues. As he recalls: \u201cIt was very useful to have a framework of fiscal constraint to ringfence the individually understandable but collectively ruinous ambitions of a new generation of ministers arriving in power with new spending priorities and the pent-up frustrations of eleven years on the opposition benches.\u201d  This archival observation from Australia\u2019s new treasurer brings us neatly to the main problem the new government faces \u2013 apart from those scary times arrayed in the commentary in budget paper number one. The main problem is the pandemic has reset expectations in Australia about what government is, and what government does, and it will fall to the Albanese government to work out a way to pay for the bigger, more empathetic government that Australians now expect.   Related: Federal budget 2022 summary \u2013 winners and losers: who will benefit and who was left behind?    The federal budget is in structural deficit. Ten years of Coalition governments resisting reality like their lives depended on it \u2013 be it the reality of the climate crisis and the inexorable energy transition, or the reality that the country doesn\u2019t have enough affordable housing stock \u2013 has created profound unmet needs in this country. But politically, it is always easier for the Coalition to raise revenue and spend money than it is for Labor to raise revenue and spend money. If we return to Glory Daze for a minute, directly after Chalmers\u2019 observation about inflation being a handy tool to temper the spending ambitions of colleagues back in 2007, our current treasurer makes the following observation about the higher bar Labor always faces in the court of public opinion: \u201cBetter to demonstrate that we could hold the line fiscally first and earn the credibility to spend wisely later.\u201d This observation is timeless enough to travel from 2007 to 2022 without losing its currency. So phase one, post-election, October 2022, is to build bona fides. Build trust. Produce an economic statement that makes good your election promises. Align fiscal policy and monetary policy as much as practicable. Bag your political opponents relentlessly for their fiscal profligacy (even when it was crisis Keynesianism) to better underscore your own sobriety. Then construct some signposts to the future, hoping that the future isn\u2019t the future Labor faced in 2008 \u2013 constant crisis management as the global economy spiralled into deep recession.  One of the more interesting signposts to the future is the housing initiative. Bob Hawke, who started out as a firebrand before maturing into a consensus prophet, had the prices and incomes accord. Anthony Albanese, who has mirrored the Hawke trajectory, has a housing accord \u2013 a handshake between governments, investors and the property industry to build more affordable housing stock. The government wants to persuade super funds to bankroll new housing stock, and it thinks it can persuade the funds to do that by creating a taxpayer-funded income stream to cover the gap between market rents and subsidised rents.    Related: From solar power for renters to detector dogs \u2013 10 budget measures you may have missed    Right now, this is a plan for a plan. The idea won\u2019t start rolling until 2024, and it is entirely unclear whether the budget-night aspiration of a million new homes built between 2024 and 2029 can ever be realised given high inflation, acute labour shortages, and supply chain difficulties look like problems with a long tail.  It could all be pie in the sky. That seems entirely possible. But this model of policy-making \u2013 roll out the big things slowly and collaboratively \u2013 is how the Albanese government has started and means to continue. Australia has big problems, and the new government wants to bring the institutions of the country to the table to start solving them. For a new Labor government, this model of policy-making has a couple of advantages. Building consensus constructs, like a housing accord, solidifies and extends the base for your progressivism.

Skilled migration places will increase from the 2021-22 planning levels to 109,900, and account for about 70% of the permanent migration program. The government is redistributing 10,000 unused places from the partner program into the skilled program. The humanitarian program is capped at 13,750 for 2022-23 and for the forward estimates. Cheaper visas The budget contains a number of tweaks to visa conditions and costs, in an effort to attract international students and backpackers to come to Australia, after pandemic border closures saw a dramatic fall in numbers. An incentive program which involves refunding visa fees for international students who arrive by 19 March, and working holidaymakers who arrive by 19 April, will cost the budget money, but those arriving will pay tax and relieve the staff shortages in hospitality. The government is also increasing country caps for work and holiday visas by 30% in 2022-23, to allow in 11,000 backpackers.

Wastewater testing has revealed the presence of synthetic drugs including mephedrone (commonly referred to as meow meow), ethylone and eutylone, which have stimulant effects akin to MDMA. The drugs are known as new psychoactive substances, a group of compounds that often mimic the effect of existing illicit substances, but which differ chemically and may not be controlled by international drug conventions. Researchers monitored wastewater in four Australian cities over the New Year period in 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The study\u2019s lead author, Dr Richard Bade at the University of Queensland, said: \u201cThere are so many of these new psychoactive substances and new ones popping up every year, and we have a relatively limited knowledge of these compounds.\u201d Mephedrone, ethylone and eutylone belong to a class of drugs known as synthetic cathinones, which act as stimulants.   Related: Three strikes: NSW falls behind rest of nation as Queensland reforms drug possession laws    David Caldicott, an associate professor and clinical senior lecturer at the Australian National University who was not involved in the study, has previously detected these cathinones in his pill-testing research. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the moment in our pill testing is that a lot of people are acquiring tablets or capsules or powders which they believe to be MDMA \u2013 or ecstasy \u2013 which are in fact cathinones,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are unpleasant and increasing in prevalence and replacing drugs that are not quite as dangerous as they are. These things can lend themselves to overdose, and it\u2019s quite clear that they have been responsible for people\u2019s deaths internationally. Caldicott said the new wastewater detections may have arisen as a result of expanded surveillance for emerging compounds, as well as from increasing consumption of such drugs. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a growing volume of consumers who are producing an equivalent increased volume of urine which will contain these products,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of observer bias and also the change in the patterns of consumption.\u201d   Related: Even Queensland has realised the war on drugs is a failure. When will NSW catch on?  | John Birmingham    Production of these compounds was \u201calmost certainly not local\u201d, he added. \u201cA lot of what we think we know about drugs in Australia comes from politely inquiring of the consumer what it is they think they\u2019ve taken,\u201d Caldicott said. The benefit of wastewater detection and pill testing is that they work complementarily as direct monitoring techniques. The study, published in the journal Water Research X, was part of an international collaboration that surveilled wastewater in 16 countries. \u201cFor the majority of the compounds that we found, Australia is on the lower side which can probably be considered a good thing,\u201d Bade said. The researchers noted that there was a decrease in detections of psychoactive substances over the 2020-21 New Year period, coinciding with the Covid pandemic.", "Labor agrees to absolute cap on emissions to secure Greens backing for safeguard mechanism climate bill [2023-03-27T16:53:32Z]": "The Albanese government\u2019s signature climate bill targeting big polluters is a step closer to passing after a deal with the Greens including an absolute cap on emissions. \nThe Greens leader, Adam Bandt, announced the deal on the safeguard mechanism bill on Monday, taking credit for \u201ca big hit on coal and gas\u201d that could effectively block half of 116 proposed new fossil fuel projects. \nBandt told reporters in Canberra the deal puts \u201csignificant hurdles\u201d in the way of new projects including development of the vast Beetaloo gas basin in the Northern Territory, with up to $1bn a year in costs to offset its emissions enough to \u201cderail\u201d the business case for the project. \nThe government believes the safeguard mechanism deal puts it on track to achieve its emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030. It will be opposed by the Coalition, which has attempted to link steps to curb emissions from new coal and gas projects to price rises despite most of the developments being for export. \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    \n    The safeguard mechanism was introduced by the Coalition in 2016. It was promised to put a limit on greenhouse gas emissions from about 200 major industrial facilities.&nbsp;\n    It applies to facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. Each facility is set an emissions limit, known as a baseline.\n    The Coalition said companies that emitted above their baseline would have to buy carbon offsets or pay a penalty. In practice, facilities were allowed to change their baselines, few were penalised and industrial emissions continued to increase.\n    Labor won government planning to revamp the scheme.\n    It has set new baselines based on emissions intensity \u2013 how much a facility releases per unit of production. Baselines will be reduced by up to 4.9% a year.&nbsp;\n    Companies can choose whether to make onsite emissions cuts or buy offsets, including Australian carbon credit units.\n    New polluting facilities, including gas and coalmines, are allowed to open and enter the scheme and would be set baselines at \u201cinternational best practice\u201d. For new gas fields, that means offsetting all CO2 pollution so they are net zero.\n    Companies that emit less pollution than their baseline allows will be awarded a new type of \u201csafeguard credit\u201d. These within-scheme credits can be sold to other polluting facilities that emit more than their baseline and need offsets.\n    A deal between Labor and the Greens introduced an absolute \"cap\" so that total emissions under the scheme can not increase and need to come down over time. The pace of reduction is not stipulated, and will be set by the climate change minister\n    The changes start on 1 July 2023.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, played down the Greens\u2019 claims by noting the deal was still in \u201ckeeping with our election mandate\u201d not to ban new fossil fuel projects while also achieving its aim of reducing absolute emissions. \nThe safeguard bill, which requires big industrial emitters to reduce emissions intensity by 4.9% a year to achieve 205m tonnes of greenhouse gas reduction by 2030, passed the House of Representatives on Monday night. The bill will go to the Senate this week, where the Jacqui Lambie Network is likely to give Labor the votes to pass it. \nIndependent senator David Pocock welcomed the proposed changes, but said he still had \u201cconcerns about the role of offsets\u201d. \nThe centrepiece of the Labor-Greens deal is a cap of 1,233m tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030, effectively imposing a declining annual limit on absolute emissions of about 140m tonnes. \n \n  Related: As Australia faces a \u2018hydrogen tipping point\u2019, the energy industry needs smart policies, not huge handouts  \n \nThe Climate Change Authority will report on whether new or expanded projects could result in the overall carbon budget being exceeded, triggering obligations on the minister to tighten rules to keep emissions under the cap. This could see the government forced to choose between imposing greater emissions reductions on existing industries or blocking new projects. \nBandt told reporters it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d the minister would opt \u201cfor a new coalmine \u2026 rather than a new lithium mine\u201d. \n \n Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \n \nNew entrants will need to meet international best practice to ensure emissions decline over time, a move that should limit existing industries such as manufacturing being disadvantaged. \nGas developments in the Beetaloo basin will have to be net zero for their direct scope one emissions, which means they will have to offset all pollution released, a step that makes it more expensive to get a project up. All new gas fields for liquefied natural gas export projects will also need to be net zero for CO2 emissions. \nCarbon offsets will be subject to the recommendations of an integrity review that reported back in January. They included a freeze on issuing credits from contentious \u201chuman induced regeneration\u201d projects until they have been assessed to ensure they comply with the methodology set out. \nA proposed \u201cpowering the regions\u201d fund will receive an additional $400m in funding to help cut emissions, on top of an early $600m. The money will be available for manufacturing sectors only \u2013 steel, cement, lime, aluminium and alumina \u2013 and not fossil fuel extraction. \nNo limits will be set on companies\u2019 use of carbon offsets to meet their emissions reductions, but if a company uses offsets to meet 30% or more of their requirements, they will be required to explain to the regulator why they have done so. \nBy 2027, the Climate Change Authority will look at the use of offsets and implementing measures to restrict their use if onsite abatement is not occurring to satisfactory levels. \nEnvironmental and business groups both welcomed the deal, which the Australian Industry Group labelled a \u201cworkable balance, providing pathways for new projects that stack up \u2026 without adding to burdens on existing facilities or threatening national emissions goals\u201d. \nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry urged the government to \u201cremain vigilant and ensure gas production is not inhibited at a time when Australia faces a domestic supply shortage\u201d. \nDespite the deal, new coal and gas projects are likely to remain a significant flashpoint between Labor and the Greens. \nBandt said Labor had acted like the \u201cpolitical wing\u201d of the coal and gas lobby in negotiations, and appeared determined to leave room for some new fossil fuel projects. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve secured a pollution trigger that, for the first time in history, means new projects must be assessed for their impact on climate pollution and they can be stopped,\u201d he said. \n\u201cLabor now has the power to stop coal and gas projects that would breach the pollution cap. Every new coal and gas project that gets approved from here on in is Labor\u2019s direct responsibility.\u201d \n \n  Related: Wash, blow dry and 1.5 degrees please: hairdressers trained to talk about climate action  \n \nBowen and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, rejected claims the deal could kill off new investment in gas projects and force up power prices. \nAlbanese said: \u201cThe demands that were placed on us, ruling out future projects, are ones that we said we wouldn\u2019t agree with \u2013 and we haven\u2019t.\u201d \nBowen said the cap meant \u201ca reduction in aggregate emissions across all facilities, old and new\u201d. \nBowen thanked those who had helped to \u201censure accountability, transparency and integrity for the scheme, and ensure flexibility and support for industry\u201d. \n\u201cBusiness and climate groups have been clear that the parliament should pass the strengthened legislation in front of it and deliver overdue policy certainty \u2013 but Peter Dutton would prefer to drag Australia backwards and continue the climate wars.\u201d", "Three Australian universities place in top 20 of QS World University Rankings [2023-06-27T20:00:45Z]": "Three Australian universities have made the world\u2019s top 20 list for the first time after new metrics placing greater weight on international research and sustainability were introduced.

The research by the Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Future Work, released on Wednesday, suggests that the biggest driver of the gap in retirement savings is still the gender pay gap. It found that women earning the median wage would accumulate about $393,676 in super, $151,000 below the level defined as a \u201ccomfortable retirement\u201d by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.   Related: Superannuation on paid parental leave still \u2018on the table\u2019 for May budget, Katy Gallagher says    The research adds to growing calls to pay more parental leave to both parents and pay superannuation on paid parental leave, demands being pursued by the Greens including in a Senate work and care committee inquiry to report on Thursday. The Centre for Future Work report\u2019s other recommendations are for greater family-friendly work practices and access to free or more affordable earlier childhood education and care, because lower participation among women and part-time work to balance work and care also drive lower retirement savings. Labor\u2019s bill expanding access to PPL and encouraging parents to share care to promote gender equality passed the House of Representatives on Monday, with PPL set to be increased to 20 weeks. But the government rejected Greens amendments to bring forward the date the entitlement will reach 26 weeks, slated for 2026.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The Centre for Future Work found that the gender gap occurs across all occupations and industries. Men have higher average salaries than women in 95% of all occupations, including those where women dominate the workforce. For example, women account for 99% of all midwives, and yet are paid on average 19% less. There are about 80 occupations in which men make up 80% or more of the workforce and that workers receive an average salary above $100,000. By contrast, no occupations in which women make up 80% or more of the workforce pay an average salary above $100,000. Eliza Littleton, a senior economist from the Centre for Future Work, said \u201cthere\u2019s been a noisy political debate about super in Australia for the past week, but this data shows that based on median income data Australian women will earn $136,000 less than their male counterparts over their working life\u201d. \u201cWhen you consider that the average super balance in Australia right now is approximately $150,000, that\u2019s a huge disparity,\u201d she said. \u201cAustralian women continue to be paid less than men on average across all industries and occupations, costing us more than $3bn across the economy each week.\u201d The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia also called on the government to reinvest some of the revenue generated by the proposed less generous tax concessions on earnings on balances above $3m.

The Grattan Institute report, released on Sunday night, found there was a \u201cconsistent pattern\u201d of successive federal governments spending more money on transport in New South Wales and Queensland \u2013 where elections tend to be won and lost \u2013 than in Victoria. Victoria has 26% of Australia\u2019s population, but received just 18% of the federal transport funds over the past 15 years. New South Wales received a third of the transport funding, but has less than a third of the country\u2019s population.   Related: Inside Victoria\u2019s lower house, where non-government business isn\u2019t allowed    Queensland, which has 20% of the country\u2019s population, received 24% of funding. The disparity could not be explained by population, population growth, size of the road network, share of passenger or freight travel, or what it actually costs the state government to run the transport system, the report said. It said the inequity is further \u201ccompounded\u201d by the federal government \u201cfunnelling much more discretionary transport funding to the most marginal seats. Meanwhile, only one of the 71 coalition major projects worth more than $100m which were promised at the last federal election had a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia. Two of Labor\u2019s 61 promised projects had business cases approved.

But there is so much more that we are doing that they could support us.\u201d Allan said the state government has committed $46bn on removing several level crossings across the state, as well as constructing the Metro Tunnel and the North East Link.

The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (Vals) had stopped taking new clients more than a fortnight ago, about the same time as the Northern community legal centre (CLC), based in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows, stopped seeing certain clients. The federal attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has indicated he intends to reform the sector, and said in a speech to a legal conference in April that it would be one of \u201cthree key matters that I would be working on from week one\u201d.   Related: NSW police accused of \u2018oppressive\u2019 tactics against subjects on secretive blacklist    But services across the country say they are struggling with demand \u2013 driven in many cases by a huge increase in family violence cases. Community legal centres rely on a combination of federal funding, which is implemented by state and territory governments, and on separate state and territory funding. The funding can be implemented for specific programs, for terms as short as a few months, for periods as long as five years, or can be ongoing. The centres that spoke to Guardian Australia said concerns about funding were related not only to the amount of funding, but how unreliable it can be, with notice given only days before \u2013 or often after \u2013 previous funding has lapsed.Many of those decisions are announced at the end of the financial year, meaning centres are in the midst of their most stressful period. A Vals spokesperson said that while the service was not keeping a tally of those who had been turned away since new referrals were paused last month, a minimum of 20 people would typically be part of the service\u2019s criminal list intake each week. Those people are now not being seen, and are typically referred on to other services, some of which are similarly stretched. The chief executive of Northern CLC, Jenni Smith, said that in mid-June the centre stopped running its \u201cgeneralist\u201d clinic, which typically saw people with less complex or urgent needs, when its waitlist ballooned out to six weeks for clients. The clinic normally sees about 10 people a week. It is the first time it has had to be cancelled in six years, Smith said.

Much of the increase in demand had been driven by family violence cases, with about 70% of the centre\u2019s clients identifying as victims of domestic abuse. \u201cThis is definitely about people\u2019s wellbeing and quality of life, but we have to keep cutting the line further and further,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe currently have eight lawyers to service a catchment of 490,000. So what do you do?\u201d In Dubbo, where the western NSW community legal centre is based, principal solicitor Pat O\u2019Callaghan said family violence cases have also crunched resources. He said there was a four-week wait for family violence clients, and while he received an unexpected $120,000 funding increase late last month, he is still waiting on further family violence related funding commitments from the federal government.

The manager of strategic and community development at Melbourne\u2019s South-East Monash Legal Service, Ashleigh Newnham, was in a similar position to O\u2019Callaghan. While they have not had to pause any services, demand is higher than ever, driven largely by an increase in family violence cases.

Related: Johnson &amp; Johnson reaches $300m settlement over pelvic mesh implants    Led by Prof Steve Kisely, a psychiatrist and public health physician at the University of Queensland, the paper examines existing studies into the impact of Headspace, which offers online, face-to-face and telehealth appointments with clinicians. Headspace also offers physical and sexual health services, alcohol and other drug services, and work and study support. The available evidence on the impact of Headspace includes studies with relatively small sample sizes, the largest of which was a study of 2,222 participants from 2008\u201309. This represents less than o.5% of the 700,000 young people seen by Headspace since 2006. It meant many existing studies were \u201c\u2026 either underpowered to detect an effect, or that the findings were unrepresentative and lacked generalisability\u201d, Kisely and his co-author wrote. \u201cAs a result, the ongoing level of uncertainty in the strength of the available evidence seems inconsistent with the current generous funding of Headspace.\u201d The paper suggests redirecting funds elsewhere, such as to primary care or under-resourced state-provided mental health services.

The CEO of Headspace, Jason Trethowan, described the paper as \u201cbiased\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d. He said it \u201cmisrepresents Headspace and makes irrelevant and inappropriate claims\u201d. \u201cOver the past 16 years, Headspace has provided more than four million services and supported over 700,000 young people at our centres right across the country,\u201d Trethowan said. He referred to a preprint study yet to undergo peer review which examined the outcomes of young people accessing supports at Headspace for mental health problems. \u201cThe results were based on the experiences of more than 50,000 young people accessing the service between April 2019 and March 2020, making it the largest study of its kind on Headspace to date,\u201d Trethowan said. The study found more than 70% of young people who sought help at Headspace centres improved in at least one of the three outcomes, including psychological distress, social and occupational functioning, and self-reported quality of life. Just under half of young people improved in self-reported quality of life, over one-third had significant improvements in psychological distress, and a similar proportion improved in psychosocial functioning.

As the government prepares to kickstart its campaign for a May election within days, Tuesday\u2019s budget includes an extra tax cut for 10 million low and middle income workers worth up to $420, and a $250 one-off cash payment for pensioners and concession card holders aimed at softening the blow of rising inflation. These measures will cost a combined $5.6bn. In addition, the government will also halve the fuel excise for six months \u2013 which is now set at 44 cents a litre \u2013 saving about $15 on the average price of a tank of petrol, at a cost to the budget of about $3bn.

Budget commitments for the regions outlined in the budget total more than $21bn over the medium term. The regional hubs package will see $2.6bn spent on infrastructure in the Northern Territory, $1.7bn in central and northern Queensland, $1.5bn in the Pilbara and $750m in the Hunter region of New South Wales. Frydenberg said the regions were a \u201cpriority\u201d for the government, acknowledging that there was \u201ca lot in this budget for the regions\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a deal with the Australian people to deliver more jobs and more growth to the regions,\u201d he said. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, attacked the document as \u201cmore a pamphlet than a plan\u201d, saying it showed the Coalition\u2019s political desperation before the election. \u201cIt is a pretty desperate political ploy when the country needed a plan for the future,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s 730 program. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that people\u2019s real wages are falling. \u201cIt\u2019s very short-sighted, very desperate, very panicked and I think the country deserves much better. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a plan that goes beyond the May election. It is the most short-sighted budget in memory \u2013 it has a shelf life of about six or seven weeks.\u201d Riding a wave of increased revenue driven by a tight jobs market, soaring commodity prices and lower-than- expected payments, the government has revised down forecast deficits by $103.6bn over the five years to 2025-26 compared with the midyear budget update. The budget documents show the underlying cash balance has improved $38.1bn in 2022-23, and by $114.6bn over the four years to 2025-26. But while the government has banked most of this to improve the budget bottom line, the total cost of policy decisions is $17.2bn next year and $30.4bn over the four years to 2025-26. Gross debt will move above a trillion dollars in 2023-24, growing to $1.17tn by 2025-26, which is the equivalent of 44.7% of GDP.   Related: The complete 2022 Australian budget: choose what matters to you    The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said the government\u2019s budget management had allowed for the delivery of a dividend back to taxpayers: \u201cBut it seeks to apply those dividends in a careful, cautious, responsible way to set Australia up for the future.\u201d The deficit for 2021-22 is expected to be $79.8bn, with total deficits across the four-year forward estimates totalling $224.7bn. At the same time, economic growth forecasts have been upgraded on the back of momentum in the jobs market and buoyant consumer spending, with GDP now forecast to grow by 4.25% in 2021-22, 3.5% in 2022-23 and 2.5% in 2023-24. Since the height of the pandemic, 701,000 Australians have come off unemployment benefits, with an extra 1.2 million people back into work, driving the country\u2019s welfare bill down $11bn over four years. Australia\u2019s unemployment rate will drop to 3.75% in the September quarter this year, its lowest figure in 50 years and three percentage points lower than the 7% doomsday scenario predicted in last year\u2019s budget. As a result of the booming jobs market, the budget says wage growth is on track to accelerate at its fastest pace in almost a decade, with the wage price index to jump from 2.75% this year to 3.25% next year. \u201cBroader and more representative wage measures are picking up more quickly as workers take advantage of the tight labour market, with average earnings per hour expected to increase by 5 per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2022,\u201d budget papers say. Frydenberg said the economic rebound outlined in the budget was \u201cremarkable\u201d, placing Australia ahead of all other major advanced economies.    But arguing risks to the economic outlook remain \u2013 including the Covid pandemic and the unfolding crisis in Ukraine \u2013 the treasurer said \u201cthis is not the time to change course\u201d to a Labor government. \u201cThis is a time to stick to our plan,\u201d he said. Inflation, which is on track to be 4.25% in the current financial year, is forecast to quickly moderate to 3% next year, followed by 2.75% the following year, providing only a small lift in real wages from 2022-23. The budget papers show that wages grew at less than half the rate of inflation in 2020-21, with prices rising 3.8% and wages falling behind, growing a mere 1.7%. Labor has already cast doubt on the government\u2019s wage growth predictions, pointing to the 52 of 55 forecasts of wage growth that have not eventuated under the Coalition\u2019s watch. And, despite the government forecasting wages growth to accelerate at their fastest rate in a decade, real wages are not likely to recover to 2019 levels until 2025. Frydenberg defended the wage growth forecasts, saying the broader national accounts measure of average earnings, which captured total remuneration including bonuses, overtime and allowances, showed stronger wage rises. Under the cost of living package, the low and middle income tax offset will be increased by $420, meaning all workers earning up to $126,000 a year will receive an extra boost when they lodge their tax return for this year. This will increase the maximum amount to $1,500 for a single income household and $3,000 for a two-income household, with the boost costing the budget an extra $4.1bn. The $250 tax-free cost of living payment will go to 6 million eligible Australian pensioners, welfare recipients, veterans and concession card holders \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. Frydenberg said the cost of living package was designed to provide temporary and practical help for household budgets to deal with the rising cost of living. \u201cEvents abroad are pushing up the cost of living at home,\u201d he said in his budget speech. \u201cHigher fuel, food and shipping costs are increasing inflation and stretching household budgets. \u201cThis budget\u2019s new cost of living package is responsible and targeted, delivering cheaper fuel, cheaper medicines and putting more money in the pockets of millions of Australians.\u201d   Related: At this gravest of times the Coalition has served up an election budget designed simply to keep itself in power |  | Katharine Murphy    The budget also includes a small business package that will give a tax incentive for investment in skills, training and digital technology, with a tax deduction of $120 for every $100 spent in these areas up to $100,000 a year. A skills package includes $2.8bn for apprentices and $2.2bn for innovation at universities, while an extra $1bn will be spent on the government\u2019s modern manufacturing strategy. The budget papers also lay out the cost of the government\u2019s flood relief and recovery effort for the New South Wales and Queensland floods, which is expected to be more than $6bn, with $3.6bn already spent. An extra $4.7bn is being spent on health services, while an extra $1.3bn will be put towards the delivery of the national plan to end violence against women and children. On defence, the government has massively ramped up spending over the next decade, including a $9.9bn commitment towards cyber \u2013 known as Redspice \u2013 with about $600m of this allocated over the forward estimates. Chalmers said Labor would support the cost-of-living relief, and rejected suggestions that the extra financial support was not necessary given that the budget papers show household disposable income increasing by about 11% since the start of the pandemic. \u201cOf course now we\u2019ve got petrol prices, grocery prices, building materials, rent, all going through the roof at the same time as real wages are going backwards, and so we do have families under genuine cost-of-living pressures,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cAnd the government is now pretending to care about those costly pressures because Scott Morrison has to call an election in the next fortnight.\u201d", "Australia will join Biden\u2019s global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, Albanese confirms [2022-10-23T07:00:45Z]": "The Albanese government has confirmed it will join Joe Biden\u2019s global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, as the prime minister warned climate change is increasing the frequency of Australia\u2019s extreme weather events. Guardian Australia revealed in June that Labor was considering signing the pledge, and the climate change minister Chris Bowen confirmed on Sunday Australia would be joining more than 100 other countries by making the commitment in the run-up to United Nations-led climate talks in Egypt next month.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Signatories to the global pledge agree to undertake voluntary actions in their countries to reduce emissions of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Reducing methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels is a global goal, not a national target. Labor has earmarked $3bn from the government\u2019s $15bn national reconstruction fund to support agricultural methane reduction and other clean tech initiatives. A further $8m has been allocated to the seaweed industry to support the commercialisation of the feed supplement asparagopsis, and Labor will direct another $5m in Tuesday\u2019s budget towards identifying and commercialising alternatives.   Related: Housing, Indigenous and domestic violence services to receive extra $560m in federal budget    Australia considered signing the methane pledge in the run-up to last year\u2019s climate summit in Glasgow, because the Morrison government was lobbied by the Biden administration to make the commitment. But Australia refused at that time because the National party would not support methane cuts. With multiple flooding events continuing to cause havoc in the eastern states, Albanese warned on Sunday the current disaster would continue to play out for weeks. The prime minister said Tuesday night\u2019s budget would establish disaster-ready funding \u201cto get ahead of these issues\u201d with better mitigation planning. He said the link between climate change and extreme weather was clear. \u201cWe need to recognise that climate change is having an impact,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more frequent events and they\u2019re more intense when they occur.\u201d The UN\u2019s climate assessment says methane has caused about 0.5C of global heating, second only to the 0.8C caused by carbon dioxide. According to Australian government data, agriculture is responsible for 70m tonnes of CO2-e from methane, coalmining is responsible for 28m tonnes, followed by 18.7m tonnes from the gas industry and 9.5m tonnes from waste. The National Farmers Federation has opposed signing the pledge in the past, but has now backed the decision after funding commitments and assurances from the government that the voluntary pledge will not escalate to a tax on livestock methane, or mandated reductions of livestock. Earlier this month, New Zealand flagged a levy on methane emissions, with the money raised to go into research to help the industry lower emissions. The NFF\u2019s chief executive Tony Mahar said on Sunday \u201cthe strong assurances and partnership provided by government mean the pledge will not negatively impact on farmers or the agriculture sector\u201d. Australia\u2019s gas sector also welcomed the decision. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association chief executive Samantha McCulloch said the industry was focused on attempting to reduce fugitive emissions from production. McCulloch noted a number of gas companies were already direct signatories to the methane pledge or had \u201cemissions reduction targets consistent with, or going beyond, the pledge\u201d. Confirmation of support for the methane pledge comes ahead of the resumption of federal parliament this week, with the Albanese government\u2019s first budget to be delivered on Tuesday. In a round of pre-budget interviews on Sunday, the treasurer Jim Chalmers confirmed Labor would not extend the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO), meaning workers earning less than $126,000 will not get a tax break, worth up to $1,500, beyond 2022. The treasurer said the government would attempt to address some of the current cost-of-living pressures with a focus on childcare, paid parental leave, pursuing cheaper renewable energy, and cheaper medicines. Chalmers also confirmed that real wages would continue to go backwards because inflation is now forecast to be higher for longer. The treasurer said Tuesday night\u2019s budget would point to an improving trajectory for wages but real growth would not occur until inflation was brought to heel, which could be another two years.   Related: What is methane, how much does Australia emit, and will we sign the pledge?    Treasury says inflation will peak in the December quarter, as expected, at just under 8%, but officials now expect Australia\u2019s cost-of-living squeeze will be more protracted, largely because of the spike in power bills. Chalmers said high inflation meant higher indexation for many government benefits. This would add $33bn to the bill for pensions and payments. Higher inflation and low unemployment will also boost tax revenue by $100bn over the first two years of the forward estimates period, but the treasurer suggested on Sunday, much of that windfall would be banked. \u201cOur responsibility when we\u2019ve got lots of inflation is not to spray money around in an indiscriminate or untargeted way because that would make our inflation problem worse,\u201d Chalmers told the ABC. \u201cWe will take a really responsible approach to these revenue upgrades.\u201d The opposition leader Peter Dutton, who will deliver his first budget reply on Thursday, told Sky News families were looking for help to deal with cost-of-living pressures, and the government was doing little to alleviate the pain.", "Budget 2022: analysis reveals Morrison government funnelling billions into must-win marginal seats [2022-03-28T16:30:59Z]": "Just 15% of projects announced in the government\u2019s multibillion dollar infrastructure budget splurge have been endorsed as priorities by Infrastructure Australia, with the Coalition instead funnelling billions into must-win marginal seats. A Guardian Australia analysis of the 144 projects being funded by the government in Tuesday\u2019s budget shows that just 21 are included on Infrastructure Australia\u2019s current list of priority projects, accounting for $5.7bn of the approximate $16bn in new funding.

This compares with fairly safe and safe seat groups, which received $650m and $2.3bn respectively. The largest single project is a $1bn commitment to faster rail between Sydney and Newcastle with the federal contribution to upgrade stations and rail lines at Wyong and Tuggerah, along with new bridges over the Wyong River. The faster rail project is one of those included on Infrastructure Australia\u2019s priority list. The spend is in the central coast seat of Dobell, which is among Labor\u2019s most marginal and one that the Coalition is targeting at the forthcoming election. Dobell will also benefit from $336m in new funding for Pacific highway upgrades through Wyong town centre, and a separate $51m highway upgrade in Wamberal. Urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, said the rail upgrade would contribute towards \u201cfaster, more frequent and more reliable services\u201d between Sydney and Newcastle which he said was the busiest regional passenger rail corridor in Australia. In the NSW marginal seat of Gilmore, which the government is hoping it can claw back from Labor with former NSW transport minister Andrew Constance running as its candidate, the Coalition will tip in an extra $352m for the Milton-Ulladulla bypass, bringing the federal government\u2019s total commitment to the project to $752m.

Seats in regional Queensland are also huge beneficiaries of the infrastructure cash splash, with almost $140m going to road projects in Flynn, Capricornia, Longman and Leichhardt. Just one of these projects worth about $10m was recommended by Infrastructure Australia. In Tasmania, $530m has been allocated to the three marginal seats of Bass, Braddon and Lyons, with the largest allocation being a $336m regional roads package for the north-east of the state. The Liberal MP for the seat of Bass, Bridget Archer, was spruiking the roads funding on her Facebook page on Monday, saying it would lead to \u201csafer roads, reduced congestion, improved freight transport and getting from A to B faster\u201d.

Western Australian marginal seats are also set to benefit, with Pearce and Hasluck to share in $240m for road and Metronet upgrades. The commuter car park program, which was criticised by the auditor general for political bias \u2013 will also receive a slice of the funding, with an extra $47m allocated across five projects in the marginal seats of Robertson, Dunkley, Lindsay and Banks, and in Goldstein in Victoria, where Liberal MP Tim Wilson is facing a challenge from independent Zoe Daniel. The package also shows the influence of the Nationals on the government\u2019s funding decisions, with a massive $3.1bn going towards the Melbourne Intermodal Terminal project in Victoria which will service the inland rail project that has been vigorously pursued by deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce. More regional development projects are expected to be unveiled in Tuesday\u2019s budget.

Last Monday Greenwich gave the NSW One Nation party leader a two-week deadline \u2013 until 17 May \u2013 to publicly and unreservedly apologise for homophobic comments he made before facing a defamation action in which \u201cmaximum damages\u201d will be sought. Latham has refused to apologise for a graphic tweet he posted and deleted on 30 March, which Greenwich described as \u201cdefamatory and homophobic\u201d and attracted widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum.   Related: Alex Greenwich gives Mark Latham deadline to apologise for homophobic tweet    Greenwich, the MP for Sydney, said Climate 200\u2019s support was consistent with the group\u2019s focus on integrity in politics and equality. The initial fundraising target is $100,000 to cover legal fees but Greenwich said this could increase. \u201cClimate 200\u2019s support in this important legal battle will help me stand up to Mr Latham\u2019s homophobic attacks, seek justice, and send a clear message that LGBTQIA+ Australians shouldn\u2019t have to put up with vilifying abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a serious matter, [which] will be costly financially [and] emotionally, and their support helps provide me with the strength and encouragement to keep me going.\u201d If Greenwich\u2019s claim is successful, his legal team believes Latham would be forced out of parliament under NSW law.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Byron Fay, the executive director of Climate 200, said the organisation had approached Greenwich with the offer to fundraise, adding that it was \u201cnot only about helping great independents get elected. We\u2019re also about supporting them when they need it.\u201d \u201cAlex has taken the brave step to stand up for what\u2019s right, and our community wanted to help him, just as we did at the recent NSW state election,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should have to suffer vile, homophobic abuse, especially from another member of parliament.\u201d According to Climate 200\u2019s platform for the fundraiser, if more money is raised than Greenwich\u2019s legal needs, it will be donated to an LGBTQIA+ rights organisation, and will be used to \u201censure we have strong climate, integrity and equality-focused community independents across Australia\u201d. Prof Stewart Jackson, an expert in politics at the University of Sydney, said it was \u201codd\u201d to see Climate 200 getting involved in the dispute, given that Greenwich is not a teal independent. \u201cIt looks as though Climate 200 are making themselves much more of a political player by supporting progressive independents more generally and that\u2019s an interesting shift,\u201d he said. Climate 200 was unable to fund its state candidates to the same extent as its federal candidates due to NSW election donation caps. Jackson said the organisation might be looking for other ways to boost its profile in the state. Climate 200 supported Judy Hannan who won Wollondilly in the NSW election, though Hannan does not consider herself to be a teal independent. Prof Graeme Orr, an expert in parliamentary law at the University of Queensland, said Climate 200\u2019s fundraiser was unlikely to be considered a political donation under the NSW electoral funding act because the benefit was not substantially for Greenwich\u2019s election or duties as MP. Orr said Greenwich would be required to disclose the source of the fundraiser on the pecuniary interest register but not the amount. The NSW government has vowed not to work with Latham this term of parliament, and the state\u2019s opposition, along with the federal One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, have called for him to apologise to Greenwich. At the time the comments were made, Hanson posted a video to social media decrying the comments. Latham has been contacted for comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 May 2023 to clarify that Climate 200 backed Judy Hannan in the NSW election, not Michael Regan as an earlier version said.", "\u2018Wildly unreasonable\u2019: agency slashes mother\u2019s NDIS funding and then her daughter\u2019s [2022-02-23T16:30:03Z]": "When Jannine Scott first joined her daughter Bethany on the national disability insurance scheme, it was \u201clife-changing\u201d. \nThe scheme funded in-home support workers for Scott, who has a spinal cord condition, and even paid for a power wheelchair and other assistive technology. \n\u201cI am sitting in my wheelchair at the moment, and without that piece of equipment, I would have been housebound much, much sooner,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the effort it takes to engage with this part of the government now is becoming wildly unreasonable.\u201d \nLike a growing number of people who are complaining about what the federal opposition claims are \u201cstealth\u201d cuts to the NDIS, Scott said her NDIS experience took a dark turn in the middle of the year. \n \n  Related: Tribunal overturns NDIA\u2019s refusal to fund assistance dog for autistic boy  \n \nIn the latest case where the National Disability Insurance Agency had scrapped supports it had previously funded, Scott said cuts to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars had left the family struggling to cope with daily life. \nShe is primary carer to two children including a three-year-old, Bethany, 11, and Scott\u2019s mother, who has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nBethany, who is home-schooled, was diagnosed with autism at the very early age of 18 months, lives with epilepsy and a rare genetic condition that impacts her mobility. \nScott got onto the scheme two years ago after a rare congenital spinal cord condition worsened to the point she found it hard to walk. Finding a clear explanation for her degenerating genetic condition has been a lifelong journey that continues to this day. \n\u201cI first presented with symptoms when I was 16,\u201d Scott, 42, said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a gradual deterioration. I got to the point where I was unable to walk very far, I was having a lot of motor and sensory changes. Once they (the specialists) found this congenital spinal cord injury, it became a lot clearer that I need support.\u201d \nYet in June last year, after a year on the NDIS, Scott received shock news: the NDIA had refused to continue funding supports related to her spinal cord injury. They now claimed there was a lack of evidence it was permanent. \nThat was despite the fact the agency had already paid for a power wheelchair, in-home carers, and other assistive technology in a previous plan. \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nScott\u2019s funding was instead allocated on the basis of her other psychosocial disabilities, and reduced by about $20,000 a year on a pro-rata basis. \n\u201cIt certainly feels very different from what it was when Bethany first started on the scheme,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt feels like every time you interact with them it\u2019s combative rather than supportive.\u201d \nBut the bad news was only just beginning. In a letter sent to the family three months later, Bethany\u2019s plan was also cut. \nBethany\u2019s \u201ccore supports\u201d funding, used to pay for things such as in-home support workers, was slashed dramatically from $86,234 to $600 over 12 months. It meant there was no support at all for in-home care for Bethany, while Scott was also dealing with cuts to her NDIS plan. \nThose changes \u2013 contrary to the recommendations of Bethany\u2019s paediatrician, according to a letter seen by Guardian Australia \u2013 were upheld by the NDIA in a new plan last month. \nThe NDIA told Scott in a letter that support workers would not be funded because some of the tasks they assisted Bethany with were considered a \u201cparental responsibility\u201d. \nScott said she was told that while Bethany\u2019s funding should fall for this reason, her own package would increase to provide more help around the house. \nExcept, of course, that three months earlier, Scott\u2019s own plan had already been cut. \nBethany\u2019s funding was boosted for therapies, and for support to help with community engagement and skills building. \nBut the plan initially stated it could no longer be used to fund Scott\u2019s preferred allied health professional: a developmental educator that her daughter had been seeing for more than a year. \nAfter inquiries from Guardian Australia, the NDIA clarified the funding could be used \u201cflexibly, including for a developmental educator\u201d. \nA spokesperson for the NDIA said plans could go \u201cup or down depending on an individual\u2019s changing disability-related needs, that is how this insurance Scheme was designed\u201d. \n\u201cThese are independent NDIS decisions based on specialist advice and the participant\u2019s individual circumstances at that time,\u201d the spokesperson said. \n\u201cThere are many factors that might result in a participant\u2019s plan value changing depending on their support needs and changes in life circumstances. \n\u201cIt is important to note Ms Scott and [Bethany] continue to receive a significant amount of disability-related funding from the NDIS.\u201d \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe spokesperson said if \u201csufficient evidence\u201d was provided to the NDIA to \u201csubstantiate the requested levels of additional disability-related health support, the NDIA would then be able to consider changes to Ms Scott\u2019s plan\u201d. \nLast week, new figures revealed a 400% increase in the number of families challenging NDIA decisions at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the past six months. \nScott was still fighting the cuts but was hoping to avoid what she described as the \u201ccruel\u201d AAT process.

I\u2019m reasonably confident that wasn\u2019t in the transition plan. It\u2019s also fair to say the government wasn\u2019t fully aware of the multifactorial debacle that is Australia\u2019s energy market \u2013 whacked by Ukraine and neglected in a domestic policy vacuum for a decade \u2013 until Chris Bowen, the incoming minister, received a volley of frantic texts from his staff as he was being sworn into the portfolio at Government House. Bowen started running at that point \u2013 and hasn\u2019t stopped since. The gas industry tantrum in response to the government securing the parliamentary numbers to redistribute a modest chunk of the industry\u2019s war profits to households and businesses crippled by high power prices \u2013 while reserving rights to do more if necessary \u2013 is predictably operatic. And before anyone could say cry me a river, media outlets prone to confusing corporate self-interest and national interest picked up the loud hailer for the LNG sector, hollering Venezuela! with nary a factcheck. Anyone surprised? No? Good, let\u2019s keep moving then. Gasgate is a noisy end to a frenetic year. But pre-Christmas noise notwithstanding, Albanese will be both relieved and pleased with the opening six months of his government. It hasn\u2019t been perfect, and next year will be significantly harder, but I suspect the initial transition to government after a decade in opposition has been more seamless than expected.   Related: Energy makes the headlines, but reset on diplomacy is Albanese\u2019s real power play    Key election promises have been delivered. As well as the whole cabinet cracking on with the policy agenda, Albanese and his ministers have invested in building relationships in parliament to keep the program moving with a minimum of argy-bargy. The latest example of strategic inclusivity is putting the Senate kingmaker David Pocock and the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, on a plane to Montreal with the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, as Australia attends the final days of the Cop15 United Nations Biodiversity Summit. But as governments move from transition to digging in and fortifying positions for the long haul, the operation takes on weight. Governing is heavy work, and governments with substantive agendas beyond daily politicking and crisis management get pulled into the policymaking vortex in Canberra \u2013 the intricate work of increments and minutiae. The focus can narrow to the complexities of deliberation and delivery. Albanese is first and foremost a political animal, not a policy wonk. He doesn\u2019t like to get bogged down. Temperament and disposition is an automatic stabiliser on the risk of this prime minister being completely subsumed by Canberra\u2019s wicked problems complex. But Labor\u2019s campaign review, released in early December, seems to me to be written with this precise risk firmly front of mind. The review has a simple message: don\u2019t get bogged down, don\u2019t assume the next election is in the bag and don\u2019t get complacent. The review was informed by substantial post-election research. It congratulates Albanese and his backroom brains trust on winning an election. It notes winning federally is no mean feat given Labor has won government from opposition only four times since the second world war and five times in the past 100 years. But it urges the Albanese government to keep looking outwards. While there has been significant focus post-election on the consequences of the Liberal party\u2019s rout in its progressive heartland, the Labor party needs to be similarly worried about a rumble in its own base. The campaign review catalogues the structural weaknesses sitting underneath the May victory. The main one is the ongoing drift of the blue-collar occupational base to political actors other than Labor.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  This is not a new phenomenon. During the Howard era, and in 2013 at the height of \u201cTony\u2019s tradies\u201d, a big chunk of blue-collar voters defected to the Coalition. In 2022, this disaffected once-were-Labor cohort sprayed their votes everywhere, including to populist rightwing candidates intent on harvesting pandemic alienation. Labor\u2019s campaign review says the government needs to engage with persistent voter dissatisfaction in parts of outer-suburban Melbourne and parts of western Sydney, and confront its \u201cunderperformance\u201d in Tasmania. It notes Labor improved its performance in Queensland relative to the catastrophic wipeout in 2019, but says the state needs something bespoke. The review recommends \u201cdeveloping the approach for the Queensland campaign earlier, and plans and policies for the various regions, while connecting these to the national strategy\u201d. Losing the western Sydney seat of Fowler for the first time since its creation in 1984 also demonstrates the fallacy of \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cmarginal\u201d seats \u2013 the binary mindset of traditional campaign thinking. For years, Australian elections have been pitched more or less exclusively at soft or swinging voters in about 15 marginal electorates. But the realignment playing out in the electorate, with voters readily abandoning tribal allegiance if there are attractive alternatives, means the terrain has changed. No \u201csafe\u201d territory is safe. Fowler going independent in May demonstrates that voters are prepared to turn on major parties taking their support for granted (a phenomenon mirrored by the results in many of the \u201cteal\u201d contests). The review says it is vital that research be undertaken to thoroughly understand the causes of the large anti-Labor swings where they occurred, and to inform remediation strategies. The new government needs to speak specifically to communities at risk of rusting off and deliver \u201cdemonstrable improvements\u201d to services and infrastructure to improve amenity \u201cin areas of longstanding support for Labor\u201d. It also recommends the allegedly safe seat holders get off their backsides. \u201cAll seats must campaign continuously throughout the electoral cycle, and it is critical that parliamentarians emphasise Labor\u2019s record on delivery in government,\u201d the review states. It recommends care in rolling out policies to address the climate crisis. The review says Labor in government has an opportunity \u201cto bridge the political divide over this issue between inner-suburban and outer-suburban and regional voters by demonstrating that decarbonisation can protect and grow jobs, and create new economic opportunities, especially in regional Australia\u201d. Policy needs to be developed in Canberra but the politics of the transition will be won or lost on the ground. The review notes the Coalition \u201cwill target Labor-held outer-suburban and regional electorates \u2013 a strategy that Labor must anticipate and counter\u201d by communicating with communities in transition directly. The review is implacable on the risk of broken promises. It doesn\u2019t name-check the stage-three tax cuts, but the context is clear when the reviewers, Greg Combet and Lenda Oshalem, note that voters have placed trust in Albanese, and the government needs to reward that trust by \u201cdelivering election commitments, providing stable government, and restoring decency in politics\u201d. I\u2019m speculating with this final observation, but the speculation feels reasonable. People with long memories will remember that Combet, as climate change minister in the Gillard government, had to front Julia Gillard\u2019s broken \u201ccarbon tax\u201d promise as he developed the government\u2019s emissions trading policy in the 43rd parliament.   Related: Peter Dutton saying no to the Indigenous voice, or saying maybe but meaning no, is not a cost-free exercise | Katharine Murphy    When Gillard said in 2010, five days before an election, \u201cthere will be no carbon tax under the government I lead\u201d it wasn\u2019t substantively a broken promise, because Labor had never proposed a carbon tax, and it didn\u2019t ever seek to implement one. But Tony Abbott weaponised Gillard\u2019s words as a broken promise, poisoning the subsequent policy development, and lending legitimacy to the genuinely terrible decision to repeal the clean energy package in 2013. It feels reasonable to speculate that Combet, given this history, would have watched the economic ministers, Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher, out flying a kite about revisiting the stage-three promise in the run-up to the October budget with a certain amount of trepidation and deja vu. \u201cNo carbon tax\u201d was an opportunistic beat-up by Abbott, but Labor was very clear before the 2022 election that the stage-three package would be delivered. No grey area there at all. Regular readers know my view. The stage-three tax cuts \u2013 which make the system less progressive and predominantly benefit higher income earners \u2013 is bad policy that has become significantly worse policy because of deteriorating budgetary circumstances. I suspect the government could win that argument if it prosecuted it with care and with honesty. Chalmers and Gallagher are already making preparations for the May budget and a tweak to that $254bn package could help repair the fiscal buffers \u2013 a worthy enterprise \u2013 or fund a number of more pressing priorities. But it\u2019s risky to change course. I\u2019ve never walked in Combet\u2019s shoes, but I can see how toxic broken promises can be for governments still establishing their identity and bona fides with voters in an age when many people think major party politics is cooked. It\u2019s going to be a tough call \u2013 one of many that await the government in 2023.

Related: NSW teachers to strike next week over pay and conditions     In 2017 the Turnbull government legislated schools funding reforms which promise 80% of the schools resourcing standard to non-government schools, and 20% to public schools, to be topped up by a further 75% from states. Despite Scott Morrison arguing against \u201cspecial deals\u201d while treasurer, after he succeeded Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister he agreed to a $4.6bn deal to ease non-government schools\u2019 transition to the new funding model including a $1.2bn \u201cchoice and affordability\u201d fund not accessible to public schools. Transition arrangements will see non-government schools continue to receive more than 80% of the resourcing standard until 2028. These include Haileybury in Victoria, which will get a total of $25m above that level from 2022 to 2028; Trinity grammar school in NSW with an extra $16.8m; Monte Sant\u2019 Angelo in NSW with $15.3m; and Brisbane grammar school with $13.9m. According to the report, public schools will receive $4.7bn less than full funding in 2022 including a gap of $1.4bn in New South Wales, $1.3bn in Victoria, $1.3bn in Queensland, $288m in Western Australia and $188m in both the Northern Territory and South Australia. This amounts to a funding gap of $1,633 a student in NSW, $2,155 in Queensland and a whopping $6,125 in the NT. States and territories are also responsible for this gap, with many slowly ramping up to their 75% share in agreements negotiated with the commonwealth. In 2022 those funding less than 75% include: NSW (71.8%), Victoria (69.7%), Queensland (69.3%), Tasmania (73.9%) and NT (58.5%). The report accuses the Coalition of using further \u201caccounting trickery\u201d by allowing states to count non-recurrent costs, such as capital depreciation; the cost of education standards bodies; and in some cases transport costs towards their share. When these measures, worth a maximum of 4% of the resourcing standard, are stripped out the \u201ctrue\u201d public school funding shortfall is $6.7bn in 2022 or at least $6.5bn a year, it said. Other instances of special treatment cited in the report include $1.9bn in capital funding grants available to private schools and $750m in jobkeeper wage subsidies for private schools during the Covid-19 pandemic. The report also cites an extra $2bn for private schools in the 2021 mid-year economic update. The government says this reflects \u201cincreased student enrolments and support of needs-based disability loading\u201d, although the report questions why public school funding was not similarly projected to increase given the \u201cvast majority of students with disability attend public schools\u201d. The AEU federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the Morrison government had \u201cshamelessly established and consolidated a deep inequity in Australian education, to the detriment of the overwhelming majority of students who attend public schools\u201d. \u201cEvery child, irrespective of their circumstances, should have a high quality education,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this government has made a series of very deliberate choices to undermine this principle.\u201d   Related: Refugee children want a future in Australia. So why are they excluded from universities? | Saba Vasefi    In February the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, said that since 2013 when the Coalition was elected, federal funding \u201cper student for all schools increased significantly in real terms\u201d. \u201cGovernment schools have been the biggest beneficiary of this growth, with commonwealth-per-student funding growing by 64.1% in real terms over the past 10 years compared with 49.8% in non-government schools,\u201d he said. Despite increases in absolute terms, the AEU-commissioned report notes the Coalition reneged on its commitment at the 2013 election to match Labor\u2019s schools funding, cutting $30bn of projected funding growth in the 2014 budget. Before the 2019 election Labor promised $14bn over 10 years for public education, but has not recommitted to the policy, citing the fact current agreements run to the end to 2023 and need to be renegotiated with the states. The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, has said Labor will \u201cwork with every state and territory to get every school on a pathway to reaching its fair funding level\u201d. The AEU will be spending $3.5m on its election campaign, which calls for \u201cevery school, every child\u201d to receive fair education funding and says that \u201cMorrison must go\u201d to achieve this. Haythorpe said \u201cpublic schools cannot afford another three years of the Coalition government\u201d.", "Morrison government urged to stop using northern Australia fund for fossil fuel projects [2022-01-26T16:30:07Z]": "The Morrison government has tipped an extra $2bn into the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) with critics concerned the funds could be spent supporting fossil fuel projects. \nThe northern Australia minister, David Littleproud, when announcing the $2bn cash injection on Tuesday did not rule out Naif using it for the development of the Beetaloo gas basin. \nThe Greens and the Australia Institute have called for rule changes to prevent the Naif being used for fossil fuel projects.

She said the committee had heard from families who had been treated as perpetrators when they were victims or were arrested after going to the police trying to report missing loved ones who were then found to have been murdered. \u201cWhat we are hearing is the absolute racism that is existing because why else would there be such an inhumane response to a human life, that has been murdered or who is missing?\u201d Concerns have been raised recently about a lack of prominence of the inquiry, with Cox noting that much of the testimony has been presented privately to the committee to ensure the families feel safe. \u201cI\u2019ve heard today in the hearings, people sleeping with the lights still on, and checking doors and not sleeping all night.

The total cost of federal, state and territory funding for the NDIS is expected to increase from $35bn this year to $52bn in 2025-26. The government has ordered a review into the program\u2019s design, operations and sustainability, raising the possibility of future sweeping changes. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the review was needed \u201cbecause the spending trajectory right now is putting incredible pressure on the budget\u201d. In an interview with ABC TV on Tuesday night, Chalmers said the Labor government did not see the NDIS \u201cas the source of savings for the sake of it\u201d.

It will also offer exemptions for producers in the domestic market if they can deliver enforceable promises to maintain a certain level of supply.

It also set a separate $125/tonne limit on black coal for Queensland and New South Wales, with both caps intended to work to curb the run-up in electricity prices. The size of the effect of the price caps on power prices is contested. While wholesale prices have been lower since December, they typically account for only about a third of users\u2019 bills and those costs are still set to rise as much as a third from July. The government also indicated it was prepared to grant gas companies exemptions under certain conditions \u2013 with details of the code to be finalised before the end of June.

The conference heard Australia was home to the biggest CCS project in the world \u2013 Chevron\u2019s Gorgon development in the Pilbara, which the company says has captured and injected underground about 6m tonnes of emissions since belatedly starting operation nearly three years ago. To put that into context, Australia alone emits about 500m tonnes a year. The Coalition did not respond to questions, including on why it believed investing clean hydrogen made with gas and CCS projects would lead to significant emissions reductions. It has previously said it was \u201cstrongly committed to a gas-fired recovery\u201d, including opening up the potentially vast Beetaloo gas basin in the NT, and has argued that support for hydrogen and CCS can reduce emissions while creating jobs. It has dismissed a warning from the International Energy Agency that no new oil and gas fields should be opened if the world is to keep the possibility of limiting global heating to 1.5C alive. The Australia Institute estimated the government had committed up to $1.7bn in climate funding that could go to fossil fuel projects since Scott Morrison set a net zero target in October. The pledges included:  $50m in the budget for a \u201cfuture gas infrastructure investment framework\u201d. $20m for CarbonNet, a project that aims to capture and store carbon dioxide in an offshore reservoir in Gippsland in Victoria. $66m in the budget for a \u201cpatent box\u201d tax concession for \u201clow emissions technology innovations\u201d. $200m for clean hydrogen and \u201clow emissions technology partnerships\u201d with Japan and South Korea.    Related: Revealed: the \u2018carbon bombs\u2019 set to trigger catastrophic climate breakdown    The institute also included the November announcement of a $500m \u201clow emissions technology commercialisation fund\u201d to back government priority areas, which include hydrogen, CCS, energy storage and \u201cultra low-cost solar\u201d. The future of the proposed fund is uncertain: the government promised legislation in the last term of parliament to set up the fund as part of the national green bank, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), but no bill was introduced. Labor backed all energy commitments in the budget, and has matched government green hydrogen commitments during the campaign, including up to $44.9m for a development in Queensland, but has expressed scepticism about the strength of government support for CCS. With the crossbench, Labor opposed government attempts to re-cast two clean energy agencies, the CEFC and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, so they could fund CCS and gas projects. A Labor spokesperson said it would support \u201cany emissions reduction technology that stacks up scientifically and commercially\u201d. \u201cWhat Labor doesn\u2019t support is the diversion of scarce renewable energy funding to non-renewables, which the government has consistently tried to do,\u201d they said. Coal and gas proposals would blow emissions target A separate analysis examined what it would mean for Australia\u2019s national emissions if all new coal and gas projects on a government department list of proposed developments went ahead. The chief executive and senior scientist at Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, found they would add 8.3% to Australia\u2019s annual emissions by 2030. It would mean the country would probably easily miss the Coalition\u2019s 2030 target of a 26% to 28% cut in emissions compared with 2005 levels unless new policies were introduced. Labor has a target of a 43% cut over the timeframe.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   If all emissions from the coal and gas developments were counted, including those from burning the fossil fuels after they were sold overseas, Hare said it would add the equivalent of 170% of Australia\u2019s current emissions to the global total. He said while not all of the more than 100 coal and gas proposals were likely to go ahead, their potential emissions would be a significant issue for the next government. \u201cThe outlook for Australia if these projects are not rolled back is really quite disastrous,\u201d Hare said. \u201cIt would add to our pariah status internationally.\u201d The Coalition and Labor say new coal and gas developments should be allowed to go ahead while businesses want to invest and if they meet local environmental standards. The Greens want a moratorium on all new coal and gas developments and thermal coal to be phased out by 2030.", "Daniel Andrews denies power is centralised in his office after Ibac investigation [2023-04-19T03:51:14Z]": "Daniel Andrews has denied power is centralised in his office, after an anti-corruption inquiry found a $1.2m contract was awarded to a union due to pressure applied by Victorian government advisers.

Likely even more so, the hours spent in a snaking queue of cars in the mid-summer heat to get a PCR test after a holiday cut short. Or being in the queue because you\u2019d sooner see a blue moon than find a rapid antigen test. But as Brooke Stanton, one of the healthcare workers who helped administer the more than 33m PCR tests that have been taken across New South Wales, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been here all along when people needed us \u2026 I\u2019m sad to go.\u201d   Related: Albanese government pledges $50m for long Covid research as inquiry calls for action     On Saturday, New South Wales became the last state in Australia to end state-funded referral-free community PCR testing for Covid-19 after a reduction in demand for the tests. At the time of the announcement in April, the health minister, Ryan Park, said it was the right time to scale it back as the health recommendations, testing behaviour and access to RATs had changed. During the lunchtime lull on the final operating day of the drive-through PCR test clinic in the Sydney suburb of Chifley, Stanton, clad in blue protective gear, reaches through the window of Deirdre Fairbairn\u2019s car to take a swab. Fairbairn is among those who Stanton has got to know in her three years conducting tests at the clinic. They include women who were pregnant when they first stopped for a test, and whose children are now almost three, and also a few regulars that Stanton says have since died.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Fairbairn, 74, is worried about having to get a referral from a GP now to get a test. Histopath, which runs the Chifley site and a number of others across the city and regional NSW, will continue to offer PCR testing for Covid-19, flu and RSV for $49. \u201cIf I get sick I\u2019ll just dial [triple 0] because I live alone,\u201d Fairbairn says from her car. In the week leading up to 11 May, there were 12,980 Covid-19 cases, 59 deaths and 6,614 PCR tests. Fairbairn is among only a handful of people who come through the testing clinic while Guardian Australia visits on Friday. It\u2019s a far cry from two year\u2019s ago, when Fairbairn made homemade apple slice for the healthcare workers to try to help ease their stress. Greg Granger, the director of operations at Histopath, recalls 18-hour work days and news helicopters buzzing overhead during the first year of the Covid pandemic. \u201cThere was no experience we could reflect on to model how to plan this out,\u201d he says. \u201cThe concept of a drive-through pathology was just so unreal the first time it was floated.\u201d According to NSW Health, the testing peak was in August 2021, with 4.1m tests conducted that month. This was followed by about 3.2m in December 2021. But it\u2019s the outbreak of the northern beaches cluster at the end of 2020 that sticks in Granger\u2019s mind as the busiest time. \u201cThey all turned up for a test. I mean, all of them,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd speaking to the patients as they came through, they weren\u2019t symptomatic, they weren\u2019t in close contact, they just wanted to do the right thing ... they were prepared to wait three, four, five hours.\u201d    But then the vibe started to shift. The worst time, Stanton says, was when travellers to Queensland were required to get a negative PCR test before arrival for Christmas holidays. \u201cMy god, that was horrible, and people were pissed off then and taking it out on us,\u201d she says. \u201cThe traffic [controllers] were spat on, you\u2019d get abused if the wait was too long.\u201d Prof Peter Collignon, an expert in infectious diseases at the Australian National University, says it is unsurprising referral-free testing is ending, given the days of needing to complete a large volume of tests is over. And at $100-$200 for a test, he says the money is likely better spent elsewhere in the health system. \u201cThe circumstances are different because the consequences are different \u2013 your risk now from Covid is 20 or 30 times lower than what it was in 2020,\u201d he says. At one point PCR tests were the major indicator of how much Covid-19 was in the community, but the number of people getting tested is now so low a more efficient and reliable measure is testing sewage. Collignon says the main group affected by the end of drive-through testing will be more vulnerable Australians who need a PCR to access antivirals. \u201cWe still need readily accessible PCRs for some people, I don\u2019t think it needs to be a drive-through, but we need pathology to test fairly quickly and not be delayed by a doctor,\u201d he says.

He wasn\u2019t there when Kevin Rudd delivered the landmark apology to the stolen generations in the House of Representatives in 2008 because the ghost of Peter past boycotted the event. Dutton\u2019s pivot has been in train for some months. After he took the Liberal leadership last year, he acknowledged he had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in 2008. But a motion in the House of Representatives on Monday marking the 15th anniversary of Rudd\u2019s apology demanded a more substantial atonement from an alternative prime minister of Australia. Dutton\u2019s \u201cmistake\u201d had been acknowledged initially in response to a journalist\u2019s question, but Monday required a bespoke message for survivors \u2013 and for voters who think Dutton is a head kicker from Queensland and can never be anything other than a head kicker from Queensland.   Related: Dutton apologises for boycotting Rudd\u2019s apology to stolen generations     Dutton has spent the summer running a soft no campaign on the voice to parliament. One of Labor\u2019s responses to the summer of soft no has been reminding Dutton regularly that he screwed up in 2008. The point of Anthony Albanese and Linda Burney re-litigating 2008 is obvious. You did the wrong thing then. Are you going to do the wrong thing now? For now, this question remains open. While Dutton searches for his answer, the anniversary forced a more extended reckoning with 2008. In the chamber, Dutton said he wanted to explain the past in an \u201cunscripted\u201d way. Dutton said he couldn\u2019t say sorry back then because the ghost of Peter past possessed the mind of a cop \u2013 one of his pre-politics professions. He was haunted by images of domestic violence, and abused women and children. Back in 2008, he felt the time for apologies would be after those problems were fixed. I\u2019m certain Dutton saw absolutely unspeakable things while on the beat, things that must haunt him. But Monday\u2019s words beg a simple question. Can the alternative prime minister of Australia only process things he can see? If this is right, it\u2019s strange that Dutton missed the survivors who wept in Canberra in 2008. They weren\u2019t just in the chamber. Strange he missed Pat Dodson, a parliamentary colleague since 2016, and a First Nations leader for many years before that. Albanese reminded Australians on Monday that Dodson hid in the long grass as a young child to avoid being rounded up and removed with some of his peers. The contours of that terrified kid remain clearly visible in a man who has spent a lifetime striving for grace, and campaigning for justice and reconciliation.   Related: Linda Burney warns MPs who walked out on apology not to \u2018repeat the mistake\u2019 with the voice    It\u2019s quite hard to fathom how a person can see one atrocity with piercing clarity, but struggle to visualise another, particularly when the invisible atrocity continues to inform the visible one. That\u2019s how inter-generational trauma works. The part relates to the whole. If reconciliation is to be a bipartisan endeavour in this country, Dutton needs to do better than selective seeing. Seeing the whole, seeing how the parts connect, is what this moment demands, because seeing that is the necessary precursor to action.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The relevant question before us, though, is not how much this political leader has learned. The question is how will he put his learning to use. And right now, that\u2019s not clear. Dutton and Albanese continue to circle one another wondering if there is a universe where this referendum campaign can be a moment of unity rather than a moment of psychic injury. Liberals who support the voice want Albanese to give them a set of conditions, both practical and procedural, where they can say yes. Albanese wants something different: the Liberals to endorse the principle of constitutional recognition now, then work through the detail in an ensuing parliamentary process.

Girls and women interviewed for the study \u2013 undertaken by the University of Sydney between late 2020 and early 2021 \u2013 said they had experienced discrimination through gender-based harassment. There were also instances of racial vilification reported. Some participants said they questioned their involvement in umpiring because of the alleged abuse, according to the report which was published in August, but only made public by News Corp on Monday. The report \u2013 titled Girls and women in Australian football umpiring: Understanding registration, participation and retention \u2013 was based on the accounts of 26 current and former women umpires and one non-binary umpire across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and ACT. Those who took part did so in the hope their experiences \u201cmay positively influence the game that they love\u201d, the report said. \u201cBeyond that, many expressed hope that their participation in this project might make a difference to the girls, women and other minorities that umpire in the future.\u201d The report was commissioned by the AFL to better understand the low take-up numbers of women and girls in umpiring, which contrasts with the exponential rise in participation in women\u2019s footy. The league said in a statement in response to the News Corp report: \u201cThe report has been a valuable resource for our team in prioritising the key initiatives to accelerate the growth in women and girls taking on umpiring roles across the country and ensuring we have a safe and welcoming pathway that allows women and girls to progress from community to AFL and AFLW level.\u201d The report included claims of unsolicited sexual images being sent to umpires, women and girls receiving sexualised comments from spectators and fellow umpires, and repetitive unwelcome approaches from fellow umpires and umpires coaches. One umpire was quoted in the report as saying: \u201cI used to receive messages of nudes that other umpires would send to me.

The overall net deficit in Covid-related expenses was $196,000 per provider for the six months from July to December last year, the report found. \nIt found more than 60% of residential aged care homes were currently operating at a loss. \nThe Aged &amp; Community Services Australia chief executive, Paul Sadler, said the current funding system was creating a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d that rewarded providers who experienced an outbreak. The loss of the early-stage temporary funding for Covid prevention, he said, had contributed to the dire financial situation of many providers. \n\u201cBasically, we\u2019re spending more money on trying to prevent Covid getting in than we\u2019re getting back from the government, even if you\u2019ve been able to get money back through the grants program,\u201d Sadler said. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been asking for through the [Australian Aged Care Collaboration], we talked about a workforce supplement being our first ask, so it\u2019s short-term funding relief, and we included in that ask a request for a reinstatement of the Covid prevention component to the funding.\u201d \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nThe most recent data paints a bleak picture of the ongoing impact of Covid in aged care, particularly in the early stages of 2022.

It will also mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care a day, as recommended by the aged care royal commission. \nBoth parties have supported aged care workers\u2019 case for a 25% pay rise, but only Labor has promised to fund it. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nThe Coalition had made a string of commitments since the damning royal commission.

The plan also included a boost to respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers, and 48,000 new training places. Labor said it would match that expenditure. \nThe Coalition was also delivering bonuses of up to $800 for aged care staff and was spending $345m to embed pharmacy services in aged care facilities. \nThe aged care sector said the successful booster rollout \u2013 which had seen high rates of triple-vaccinated residents, and was now delivering fourth doses \u2013 had helped protect residents.

Depending on how such a law is conceived, it could also prevent landlords from increasing rents between tenants. \nRent caps still allow landlords to increase the amount they charge tenants, but limit how frequently and by how much rent is increased. \nWhere are rent controls in place? \nThe Australian Capital Territory introduced controls in 2019 that limit rent increases to 110% of inflation a year. For example, a renter paying $400 a week while inflation is 7% could cop a rent rise to $430. If a landlord wants to increase it further, they have to justify it. \nIn Germany, where more than half of households rent, price-control policies have existed since the 1920s. The system, known as Mietpreisbremse or \u201cthe rent-price brake\u201d, was introduced in 2015 and stipulates that the rent for a property cannot be more than 10% higher than the local market rate, which is set out in an index. \n \n  Related: What does Australia\u2019s median rent of $600 a week get you in each capital city?   \n \nOther countries such as Ireland, Scotland and Spain cap rent increases in certain locations where there are tight markets.

An Essential poll, commissioned by the Australian Medical Association, found voters who had traditionally supported the Coalition on health and hospital funding were now deserting them. Support in this key area had dropped, with 34% now questioning the government\u2019s record. Only the Morrison government\u2019s handling of the climate crisis and cost of living pressures registered greater levels of disapproval. Of those polled, 37% were less likely to vote for the government on climate, while 38% were not supportive of Morrison on cost of living.  The poll of 1,069 voters was conducted from 3 to 6 February, before a torrid parliamentary fortnight in which the Morrison government dropped its religious discrimination bill and pivoted to national security to recover its poor standing in the polls.

States believe the cost-sharing deal struck during the Covid-19 pandemic is not fit-for-purpose now coronavirus is circulating in the community, as it does not keep up with increased staffing costs, PPE and expected new demand from delayed care and long-Covid. Despite the pressure from the states in the lead-up to the 2022 election, the AMA is yet to secure a commitment from either side of politics for 50-50 funding, with Labor more focused on GP and specialist out-of-pocket costs. Anthony Albanese has promised Labor will \u201calways be better\u201d on health, signalling higher levels of funding, but is yet to announce its full policy. Coalition voters still approved of the Morrison government\u2019s handling of hospitals, with 29% saying it made them more likely to support the government and 19% less likely. But the issue is biting among voters aged 55 and over, 19% more of who said they\u2019d be less likely to vote Coalition, and non-major party voters, 37% more of who said they\u2019d be less likely to vote Coalition. The AMA\u2019s Clear the Hospital Logjam campaign argues that the public hospital system was struggling before Covid-19, but now faces blowouts in ambulances ramping, emergency departments at capacity, and long waits for essential surgery.

But the state opposition has lashed the Andrews government, saying the pressure has been caused by \u201cyears of Labor mismanagement\u201d prior to the pandemic.

The commonwealth last month extended the Covid-19 National Partnership Agreement to 30 September. The agreement supports the state and territory health systems respond to the pandemic, with a further $982.5m committed in the March federal budget. On Friday, Andrews said Victoria required the additional funding to catch up on deferred care such as elective surgery that had been pushed back during the pandemic. \u201cI would again, urge the prime minister and the federal treasurer to reconsider that $1.5bn cut to health that occurs in September,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThis will not be over in September.\u201d Under the agreement \u2013 where the commonwealth funds 50% of Covid-related health costs \u2013 Victoria received an additional $1.56bn this financial year.

The Age reported in February that the governments of NSW, Victoria and Queensland had all petitioned the commonwealth for a 50:50 funding split for all costs. Under the current agreement, the federal government contributes 45% of hospital funding, but also places a cap when growth rises above 6.5%. The Australian Medical Association \u2013 which supports a 50:50 split \u2013 has estimated the change and removal of the cap would cost the commonwealth $20.5bn across a four-year period.

Economists, though, are already predicting consumer prices will be rising at a 5% clip by mid-year, and that the RBA will soon start to respond by jacking up the cash rate from its record low of 0.1% that it has sat at for 15 months. As ANZ recently noted, \u201cthe last time the RBA increased the cash rate was 2010, so many borrowers have no experience of rising mortgage rates\u201d.

The acquisition order was announced in July, despite the government putting the upgrades of other suburban stadiums on the backburner, citing acute budget pressures. The surviving project is in Ayres\u2019 own highly marginal seat of Penrith, prompting unhappy councils in other areas to claim the government is trying to shore up support there ahead of the 2023 state election, at the expense of sporting grounds elsewhere. Ayres is now pushing for a new stadium, similar to the TQL stadium in Cincinatti, that would rival the new Allianz stadium \u2013 which holds 42,500 people and cost $800m \u2013 in Moore Park.   Related: Out of left field: why Penrith\u2019s $300m stadium upgrade was a surprising choice     Documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information laws reveal a concerted campaign from within Ayres\u2019 office from as early as March for the more ambitious plan of acquiring the paceway. The current minister for sport, Alister Henskens, insisted before budget estimates last month no final decision had been made to acquire the paceway site.. But the documents show Ayres was pushing the paceway option over the plan to rebuild the Penrith Panthers\u2019 home ground on the existing site until he lost the portfolio in August. In March Ayres wrote to the premier, Dominic Perrottet, urging the government to look at \u201can alternative plan\u201d. The documents also show his office kept control over key elements of the project, despite Infrastructure NSW being the agency responsible for construction. The 11-hectare paceway site is between the Panthers\u2019 current stadium and club and the Penrith CBD. It is used for trotting, a club and the Penrith Show, and also houses a number of charities. The paceway owners, the Penrith Agricultural society , had been discussing with Penrith council whether the site could be redeveloped into commercial and residential properties to help fund a move away from the Penrith CBD. But it was blindsided by the notice to compulsorily acquire the site. The government owns the site of the current stadium. The combined site would accommodate restaurants, bars, offices and possibly housing as well as a 30,000-seat stadium. The documents reveal that in November 2021, business cases for the redevelopment of Penrith stadium (on its current site) and Manly\u2019s Brookvale stadium were completed. The Brookvale assessment, released to the upper house under a call for papers, showed a poor benefit-to-cost ratio of just 0.24 (where 1.0 represents break even). The Penrith assessment has not been released.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  A month later, Perrottet announced that the Penrith redevelopment on the current site would go ahead in 2023, with a budget of $309m, and would take two years. But within weeks of that announcement, Ayres became sports minister again and by March there appears to have been a major rethink. What prompted it is unclear from the documents, other than that the more ambitious project was supported by the Penrith Panthers, one of the biggest clubs in Australia. On 18 March, Ayres wrote to the premier saying he had asked names redacted to undertake community consultation, including an online forum, and to prepare a project brief \u201cfor the new stadium\u201d. \u201cIf the outcomes from this engagement suggest that an alternative scheme is a better outcome \u2026 [redacted],\u201d Ayres wrote. \u201cIf the announced option is still considered the best way forward following further engagement, then I will ask for work to proceed toward developing the initial design and the associated planning application,\u201d he said. The news that there was a new option was soon out in Penrith. In early April, the council met Infrastructure NSW and raised \u201crumours via social media about purchase of the Paceway site\u201d.    Notes of a consultation between INSW and Panthers Group record its strong preference to build on the paceway site, because it would allow a bigger stadium, with no disruption to the rugby league team\u2019s home games during construction. Panthers stressed the importance of having more corporate facilities in the new stadium. By May the paceway\u2019s chief executive, Tash Greentree, was becoming increasingly concerned.  On 26 May, INSW\u2019s chief executive, Tom Gellibrand, told the paceway owners \u201csome feedback suggested the best use of the Paceway site would be to put the redeveloped stadium on it\u201d. But he said the government had not made a decision. In June, the infrastructure minister, Rob Stokes, was asked to sign a formal project authorisation order. The site description included both the paceway and the current stadium. By July, INSW was ready to begin compulsory acquisition of the Paceway site but it was Ayres\u2019 office who drove the timing of the official letters, who decided that only two local journalists be notified and who approved the media statement. \u201cWe are ready to commence the commercial negotiations for the acquisition of the Penrith Paceway site,\u201d Gellibrand wrote to Ayres\u2019 senior adviser, Michael Haynes, on 4 July.   Related: Cleared of wrongdoing, the political fate of former NSW minister Stuart Ayres remains uncertain    \u201cCan you confirm from your end that the minister for sport supports us commencing that activity today?\u201d \u201cThe minister is happy for you to commence the activities as outlined,\u201d Haynes replied. Ayres said in a statement it was standard practice for government agencies to update ministers\u2019 offices about progress and community engagement. \u201cThe Office of Sport, Infrastructure NSW and Venues NSW did so regularly when I was the minister.\u201d He said he strongly opposed the paceway being rezoned from recreation to residential as proposed by its management. \u201cThe Penrith Paceway site was identified as the optimal site for a future stadium in Penrith by the business case presented to government. The design report in the business case could not have been any clearer. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the Paceway site is the best site for the new stadium and is completely inappropriate for thousands of apartments,\u201d he said. A formal decision is still pending.", "Anyone hoping for cost-of-living relief will be disappointed but probably not surprised | Peter Hannam [2022-07-28T08:25:27Z]": "As economic statements go, Jim Chalmers\u2019 speech to parliament on Thursday was not a lot more than an update of Treasury forecasts. \nWe learned that Australia\u2019s GDP growth would be slower, inflation higher and jobless rates lower \u2013 but only marginally \u2013 than predicted just prior to May\u2019s federal election. \nThe revised predictions hold some import but carry less weight than the data the Reserve Bank of Australia will rely on for its quarterly statement on monetary policy due for release on 5 August. Future RBA rate rises will hinge on them. \nChalmers\u2019 numbers will also be updated in the out-of-cycle budget he will bring down in October. And our volatile era of viruses and violence mean only so much store can be placed in economic estimates for years to come. \n \n  Related: Australia\u2019s inflation rate to peak at 7.75% in December quarter, economic update predicts  \n \nHowever, while his speech may have lacked surprises, it nevertheless lays down markers for what\u2019s to come, both in the budget and beyond. Chalmers is seeking to distinguish his approach from the near-decade of Coalition rule that preceded it. \nAnyone hoping for extra cost-of-living relief would have been disappointed but probably not surprised. Chalmers will probably save any sweeteners \u2013 if there are any \u2013 for his budget, but there is actually little room for the government to move. \nChildcare support, cheaper medical prescriptions and spending on a modernised electricity grid to allow faster take-up of low-cost renewable energy were his main offerings that we\u2019ve heard about before. \n\u201cThey are very boxed in by election promises,\u201d says John Hawkins, a senior lecturer at the University of Canberra who served as a senior economist with both Treasury and the RBA. That means the fuel excise cut \u2013 costing $3bn for just six months \u2013 won\u2019t be extended and nor will the low- and middle-income tax offset. \n\u201cEven if they do try to give people money to compensate for the cost of living pressures, that\u2019s just going to stimulate the economy more,\u201d Hawkins says. To spend more would be having the \u201cRBA jumping on the brake and the government jumping on the accelerator\u201d. \nChalmers\u2019 speech, though, was partly aimed at massaging expectations, particularly for workers anxious their wages are not keeping up with inflation \u2013 in fact are falling further behind. \nFor now, the treasurer is projecting 2023-24 as the year wages finally grow faster than headline inflation. By most estimates, there is a lot of slippage to claw back. \n \n \n  Using the full updated figures out to June 2026 supplied by @JEChalmers today. By then real wages will still be around 1.5% below where they were before the pandemic.(Real wage falls take a long time to recover) pic.twitter.com/se33lfdXi0\u2014 Greg Jericho (@GrogsGamut) July 28, 2022\n  \n \nWe\u2019ll get an update of how much wages rose in the June quarter when the wage price index is released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 17 August. The March quarter WPI was 2.4% and Chalmers\u2019 update on Thursday pencilled in 2.75% for the year to June. \n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising how little acceleration there has been in wages at a time when the unemployment rate is down to 3.5%,\u201d Hawkins says. \nThat may change as employers bid against each other to fill vacancies. Still, the Treasury estimates only project WPI quickening to 3.75% by June 2023 \u2013 a level it will hold roughly firm for the years out to June 2026. \nAnother constraint on the budget \u2013 and hence, on Chalmers\u2019 inclination to spend \u2013 are the mounting costs. The rising bill for Australia\u2019s trillion-dollar debt will outpace the NDIS and another demands.

Households remain \u201cvery well buffered from the impact of Covid\u201d with some $250bn salted away that they can drawn upon. \nInterest rates, while on the rise, also remain \u201cquite low\u201d, she says, and there is no indication the spectre of recession is stalking Australia as it is many other rich nations. \nCommodity prices may be on the skids \u2013 particularly for iron ore \u2013 but they are still at historically high levels \u2013 particularly for coal \u2013 and that will support government coffers. \nTreasury, for instance, continues to bank projected royalties for iron ore at US$55 (A$79) a tonne for iron ore, US$130 for coking coal and US$60 for thermal coal. \nCompare those numbers with current market rates above US$100 for a tonne of iron ore. Both types of coal are at or above US$300 a tonne, thanks mostly to the sanctions for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent scramble to diversify energy sources. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nMurphy notes coal alone delivered the recent Queensland budget $5.7bn that it wasn\u2019t banking on. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for a state government as a surprise,\u201d she says. \nStill, Chalmers is left with a \u201creally tough balancing act\u201d, with a lot of extra demands to come, not least from the Covid front. There it\u2019s already having to set aside an extra $750m with more likely to be needed, Murphy says. \nAnd to the extent Chalmers\u2019 statement was about attributing blame for what ails the economy and budget on the Coalition, that job is probably not quite done, Hawkins says. \nThe last Morrison government budget relied on annual productivity gains of 1.5% to underpin its growth and other estimates. However, that rate was only seen in the more reforming era of Hawke-Keating and the early years of Howard and Costello. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no sign that surge is going to be repeated,\u201d Hawkins says.

The early diligence has been rewarded with positive opinion polls, and Labor has enjoyed a honeymoon with voters, but the new government faces many complex challenges in 2023. The road to 21 May Scott Morrison began his final year in office on the back foot. Australians were fatigued by the coronavirus pandemic and battling natural disasters.     People were unsettled by the war in Ukraine and escalating geopolitical tensions closer to home. Inflationary pressure was increasing, eroding family budgets. Digging in for a tough political fight, the Coalition focused efforts on a cash-splash budget to be delivered in March. The government gave cash to Australia\u2019s low- and middle-income earners and cut the fuel excise in half, and $20bn was allocated to regional spending over the medium term. But the largesse failed to turn the political tide.  On election day, the Liberal party recorded its lowest seat share since 1946. A swath of Liberal moderates \u2013 including the architect of the budget, Josh Frydenberg \u2013 were defeated by teal independents, the Greens gained territory in Brisbane and Labor was able to form its first majority government at federal level since 2007. The Australian National University\u2019s Australian Election Study later concluded Morrison was the least popular major party leader since its research began in 1987. Rapid fire transition Labor sprinted out of the blocks after winning the election, beginning parliamentary negotiations on its new emissions reduction target for 2030 and on the federal integrity commission \u2013 Australia\u2019s first federal anti-corruption commission. The 2030 target passed in August and the integrity commission in November. The government hosted a jobs and skills summit, setting the scene for new legislation authorising multi-employer bargaining as a policy response to years of stagnant wages. The industrial reform legislation strained Labor\u2019s initially cordial relationship with key business groups and also required concessions to secure support from Senate kingmakers. After delivering a budget that forecast a 56% increase in energy prices by the end of 2023, Labor spent the closing months of 2022 working up a regulatory intervention to try to secure price relief for consumers and businesses. Anthony Albanese also embarked on a wide-ranging reset of diplomatic relationships with the United States and France, and sought early personal connections with regional partners including Japan, India, Indonesia and Pacific leaders. Supported by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, Albanese began to track towards a reset of the China relationship, which culminated in a face-to-face meeting with Xi Jinping in Bali in November.     While Labor forged ahead, the Coalition regrouped, appointing Peter Dutton as leader, but Morrison cast a long shadow over the redux. It was revealed in August that he had sworn himself in to a number of ministerial portfolios during the pandemic, mostly without telling his former colleagues, Labor set up an inquiry led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and the House of Representatives went on to censure the former prime minister \u2013 a historic rebuke. Tough battles ahead: climate policy While the Albanese government secured an early win on legislating its 2030 emissions reduction target, a target has little value without mechanisms to drive the promised transition to low emissions. Over the coming months, Labor will reboot the rules for Australia\u2019s heaviest polluters, who have traditionally been vociferously opposed to serious climate action. The government proposes to engage the Abbott-era \u201csafeguard\u201d mechanism to accelerate the rate of emissions reduction in facilities such as coalmines and aluminium smelters. Labor had wanted to begin this work before Christmas, but that ambition was derailed by the power prices intervention. Given heavy polluters often buy carbon credits as an alternative to reducing emissions, the government also has to ensure the integrity of the credits scheme. After a respected whistleblower described Australia\u2019s scheme as a fraud and waste of taxpayer money, Labor established a review by the former chief scientist Ian Chubb. The government will drive the safeguards overhaul at the same time as responding to the Chubb review \u2013 in January. Shortly after that, Labor also has to push along its strategy to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles. The other big item in the transformation agenda is building new high voltage transmission lines to bolt more renewables into the power grid \u2013 a huge project rendered more complex by supply chain disruptions and labour shortages. Next year is when the government\u2019s climate agenda will be fleshed out. The response will be a key test. Are the climate wars over, or is Australia about to enter a new phase of an old battle? Voice to parliament Albanese has made achieving the central recommendation of the Uluru statement \u2013 establishing a constitutionally enshrined body to make representations to parliament and the government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples \u2013 a key objective of his prime ministership. Achieving this requires a successful referendum delivering the required double majority (approval from a majority of voters nationally and a majority in a majority of the states). History suggests bipartisanship is the bedrock of successful forays to change the constitution, but the Nationals have already declared opposition. The Liberals are yet to determine a position.    The referendum is expected to be held in 2023, but it is not entirely clear when. Some suggest October. Others hint it could be earlier. The prime minister flagged the possible referendum question when he attended the Garma festival in July \u2013 do you support an alteration to the constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice? He also suggested words that could be added to the constitution. Opponents of the voice claim the change must be resisted because there is not enough detail about what it will do, a contention rejected by ministers and Indigenous leaders who have been working on the proposal for years. Opinion polls suggest a majority of Australians in a majority of states would support the voice, with young people strongly in favour. Polls also suggest many people don\u2019t have their head around the detail, a vacuum which could prove problematic for advocates of constitutional reform in the event \u201cno\u201d campaigners are able to mount an effective scare campaign. Cost of living \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d is the famous political maxim coined by the Democratic party strategist James Carville. The quip persists because the performance of the economy is very often linked to the longevity of governments. Treasury forecast in October inflation was likely to peak at close to 8% by the end of 2022, before easing gradually over the next two years. That means sustained high consumer prices, accompanied by higher borrowing costs. These conditions are never comfortable for governments, but cushioning voters from a sustained cost-of-living crisis comes at a cost.    Earlier in 2022, the economic ministers, Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher, flew a kite about the stage-three tax cuts. Before the election, Labor promised to deliver the stage-three package, which predominantly benefits higher income earners. But flattening the tax scales will cost $254bn over 10 years. Chalmers and Gallagher gestured towards some tinkering to rebuild the fiscal buffers, but Albanese ultimately killed the debate. Rebuilding the fiscal buffers remains a sound idea, given the uncertainty in the economic outlook, but it is unclear whether Labor is prepared to risk breaking an election promise. It is possible the government could seek a mandate for broader tax changes at the 2025 election. In any case, inflation and the state of the economy will remain a significant focus in 2023. Escalating great power competition in the Indo-Pacific also has significant fiscal implications for Australia. In the first quarter of next year, there will be a conversation about Australia\u2019s ability to defend its shores. Deterrence and military capability Australia\u2019s decision to enter the Aukus nuclear submarine agreement with the United States and the UK generated headlines around the world. Questions persist about how this agreement will be executed given Australia lacks a domestic nuclear power industry. It is also unclear how Australia will manages the capability gap that exists in the interim. There are also fears Aukus will fuel a regional arms race.    Can Australia defend itself in a dangerous age? Do we have the right mix of hardware and personnel?    Nuclear submarines are only one component of a much bigger strategic question. Can Australia defend itself in a dangerous age? Do we have the right mix of hardware and personnel? Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine has put this existential query front-of-mind for many governments, including our own. To this end, an external review of Australia\u2019s defence capability will report in March. That review is expected to pave the way for more spending on defence and deterrence, including the acquisition of more missiles and drones to step up Australia\u2019s capacity to respond against sudden attack. Expect to hear much more on these questions in the opening six months of next year. Electoral funding: testing the limits of new politics? When Australians elected a Labor government in May, they also ushered in a progressive parliament with a substantial crossbench, including teal independents backed in part by the fund-raising juggernaut that is Climate 200. Disclosures released by the Australian Electoral Commission indicate the teal campaigns in 2022 were powered by $10.2m of political donations. Climate 200 raised $13m and donated to 23 campaigns. The resources magnate Clive Palmer has also invested a fortune in recent federal elections, with a much smaller reward. Labor will have the numbers in parliament for an overhaul of the donations and disclosure regime, and has plans to legislate caps on electoral spending. The ALP\u2019s 2022 campaign director, Paul Erickson, says the current lack of restrictions \u201chas allowed extremely high-net-worth individuals, groups and networks to distort the political conversation with levels of advertising that were previously inconceivable in Australian elections\u201d. But Climate 200 notes electoral expenditure caps \u201cdo not put candidates on a level playing field if they don\u2019t take into account the entrenched benefits to incumbents\u201d. It is unclear whether Labor\u2019s inclination to constrain campaign spending will be shared by the Liberal party after it lost a chunk of its metropolitan heartland to the teals in May, or whether a version of that reform can be hammered out, bearing in mind legitimate concerns about the structural benefits of incumbency. This won\u2019t be the biggest debate of the new political year, but it will be an interesting one.", "\u2018Racism: It Stops with Me\u2019 campaign funded by disaffected former Collingwood football club sponsor [2022-07-11T17:30:06Z]": "A new campaign to tackle racism launched by the Australian Human Rights Commission was partly paid for by a sponsor who redirected funding from the AFL\u2019s Collingwood football club after a report commissioned by the club found a culture of \u201cstructural racism\u201d. \nThe AHRC said it hopes to tackle racism by appealing to those who have not experienced it. \n \n  Related: Collingwood AFL club\u2019s culture of \u2018structural racism\u2019 condemned in scathing report  \n \n\u201cRacism: It Stops with Me\u201d targets Australians without experiences of racism, urging them to reflect and understand the harm it causes. \nAfter a stinging rebuke of its deeply entrenched racism, insurance company CGU withdrew its sponsorship of Collingwood and announced it would redirect funds to initiatives to tackle racism. \nAustralian Race Discrimination Commissioner, Chin Tan, said the campaign is an opportunity for all Australians to reflect on how racism and discrimination effects everyday Australians. \n\u201cRacism is a longstanding issue in Australia,\u201d Tan said. \n\u201cIf we are going to make a change then we need people from right across the spectrum \u2013 including those who don\u2019t have lived experiences of racism.\u201d  \nKeyarny Lamb, a spokesperson for the campaign said racism and discrimination has taken its toll on her and her loved ones\u2019 daily lives at work, home and school. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been exposed to racism on many different levels, whether it be through law enforcement [or] in the community.\u201d \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s really kind of shaped me as a person,\u201d the Kamilaroi and Yorta Yorta woman said. \nLamb said she hoped the campaign would raise awareness about the effects of racism and discrimination and empower people to stand up and call it out. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about opening up their minds and it\u2019s about starting a conversation.

Related: Josh Frydenberg open to intervening in insurance market as climate change pushes up premiums    \u201cWe\u2019d have a chance to look at the full extent of nearly a decade of rorts and waste and start dealing with it.\u201d  Frydenberg used the same forum a week ago to outline the Morrison government\u2019s shift in its fiscal strategy away from supporting the economy to get through Covid to one that plots a shrinking budget deficit as a proportion of overall activity. Economists predict Australia\u2019s falling jobless rate and booming commodity prices, fanned of late by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, will cut the current fiscal year\u2019s budget deficit by as much as $30bn, but still leave more than a decade of deficits ahead. Chalmers is expected to say that no single budget could possibly \u201cundo all of the damage of the last 10 years, not even the last two\u201d. David Richardson, a senior research fellow at the Australia Institute and a former parliamentary researcher, said there was no recent case of a change of government prompting a new budget. Bob Hawke\u2019s election in March 1983, which was followed by a national economic summit a month later, offered the closest comparison. A second budget in 2022 could allow an Albanese government to \u201cmake a big bold splash\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a big chance for them to say what they\u2019d do differently,\u201d Richardson said.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        Given the major parties already prepare comprehensive pre-election statements, a follow-up budget \u2013 particularly after a new government gets a close look at the Treasury\u2019s books \u2013 may be the logical next step, he said. Chalmers\u2019 comments foreshadow elements of what may be Labor\u2019s formal response to the 29 March budget.  An incoming Albanese government would set five tests for Frydenberg\u2019s budget and how it would frame its own, the shadow treasurer will say.  These include whether the budget \u201crebuilds communities impacted by flood and fire fast enough\u201d, and whether it eases \u201ccosts of living pressures enough, responsibly enough\u201d. The Morrison government has flagged a \u201ctargeted\u201d cost of living package will be in the budget, while Frydenberg has said the clean-up from the floods in Queensland and NSW will be a central focus. Chalmers will say the third Labor test would be whether the budget supported the recovery and \u201cmakes supply chains, businesses, vulnerable communities, public health, and family budgets more secure and resilient\u201d. A fourth would be whether productivity can be boosted to lift \u201cthe speed limit on the economy\u201d to enable quicker growth without stoking inflation. The final test would be \u201cwhether it ends the rorts and waste, and sets out a clearer path to budget repair\u201d. Any budget, though, would also likely have to contend with rising interest rates since they won\u2019t remain near zero, \u201cno matter who wins office\u201d. An increase in interest rates by one percentage point \u2013 as major banks expect over the next year \u2013 would result in homeowner-occupiers paying $13bn more in interest annually. Higher rates, though, would also \u201cpunch holes in the national budget\u201d, Chalmers will say. Since the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook last December, interest yields on some commonwealth debt had doubled and two-, three-, five- and 10-year bond yields have increased by more than 70 basis points.   Related: How Australia\u2019s skyrocketing cost of living is pushing people into poverty    \u201cIn 2024-25 we could be paying $4.7bn more in interest, taking our interest bill to much more than we spend on family tax benefits, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and more than double what the commonwealth spends on government schools or childcare support,\u201d Chalmers said. Separately, a report by the Australia Institute has found the $15.7bn a year Stage 3 tax cuts proposed by the Morrison government and supported by Labor would give those with annual earnings of more than $200,000 a windfall of $9,075. Beneficiaries of the tax cuts, which Labor supports, include bank chief executive, surgeons, and even federal politicians, according to the institute\u2019s Fair Go Gone report. It also found low-income workers on less than $45,000 a year, including aged care workers, disability carers and minimum wage employees, would get nothing. \u201cBy cutting taxes for the higher-come earners, this extreme plan will make our tax system permanently less fair,\u201d Richard Denniss, the institute\u2019s chief economist said. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on Australia\u2019s fair-go, progressive tax system.\u201d Should the government also use next week\u2019s budget to end the low-and-middle-income tax offset (Lmito), middle-income earners such as teachers, nurses and midwives would pay $1,080 more in tax, the report said.", "Morning mail: Covid deaths in aged care, record rents, brutal and brilliant State of Origin decider [2022-07-13T20:57:29Z]": "Good morning.

The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday the high bar for public hearings was the \u201cright setting\u201d to avoid \u201creputational harm\u201d, but did not rule out that it was included at the Liberal opposition\u2019s request. Although crossbench MPs have praised the inclusion of a power to investigate parties external to government, the privacy of Nacc hearings sets up a fight with the Greens and independents, re-enlivening concerns Labor is attempting to appease the Coalition. Senators David Pocock, Jacqui Lambie and the Greens \u2013 who may have the casting votes in the Senate if Labor does not secure Coalition support \u2013 all raised concerns about the bar for public hearings. The \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d requirement echoes the Victorian regime, but is a higher bar than in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, the Northern Territory, ACT and Western Australia. Pocock told Guardian Australia \u201cthe independent commission should be able to make hearings public if they believe it is in the public interest, not be constrained to do so [only] in \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019\u201d. The Greens justice spokesperson, David Shoebridge, warned the bar \u201cignores the fact that sunshine is a great disinfectant\u201d.    Labor wants the Federal NACC to only be able to have public hearings in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d - this is too high a bar and ignores the fact that sunshine is a great disinfectant.&mdash; David Shoebridge (@DavidShoebridge) September 27, 2022    Shoebridge told reporters in Canberra the Greens are concerned \u201cthe limitation on public hearings is designed not just to appease the Coalition \u2026 but also some of those voices in Labor who have always wanted to limit the reach\u201d of the Nacc. Lambie said the bar \u201craised an eyebrow or two\u201d and the Jacqui Lambie Network has now asked the government to explain why it is necessary. Independent MP, Zali Steggall, said it was a \u201cmajor red flag\u201d and \u201ccould result in very few public hearings\u201d. Independent MP Kate Chaney called for \u201cpublic hearings whenever it\u2019s in the public interest\u201d. Transparency campaigner and former judge of the Victorian court of appeal, Stephen Charles, told Sky News the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d was \u201cvague\u201d and had resulted in \u201ccomparatively fewer\u201d public hearings in Victoria. The Centre for Public Integrity chair, Anthony Whealy, said the Coalition\u2019s anti-corruption proposal was \u201csteeped in secrecy\u201d and it \u201cwould be a shame if the [Labor] government compromises with the opposition on this point\u201d. \u201cIt will cause those investigated to challenge the decision in court which will require the integrity commission to reveal all of its information publicly before an investigation can be finalised,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis delays investigations and can lead to evidence being interfered with.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  Independent MP Monique Ryan said the \u201cvery high bar \u2026 could cause delays due to challenges to the investigative process\u201d. Independent MP Helen Haines was more circumspect, saying she could not comment until she had seen the details in the bill.. Independent MP Zoe Daniel said she didn\u2019t \u201cdisagree with a high bar\u201d but would wait to see the definition of exceptional circumstances.  On Friday the Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, confirmed the opposition is talking to the Albanese government \u201cin good faith\u201d regarding the bill, but warned against powers so extensive they could result in \u201cshow trials\u201d or \u201cprotracted investigations\u201d. The Nacc bill passed Labor caucus on Tuesday and will be introduced to the House of Representatives on Wednesday. It will then be considered by a joint select committee inquiry before a possible final Senate vote in November. On Tuesday Dreyfus confirmed the Nacc will have power \u201cto investigate conduct occurring before it was established\u201d. Asked why the commission would have to consider public hearings both in the public interest and to be required by \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, Dreyfus replied that he expects \u201cthat most of the hearings conducted by this federal commission, just as for the state and territory commissions \u2026 will be conducted in private\u201d. \u201cWe think that is the right setting and it shows that the commission has to take that into account before it decides to hold a public hearing but it will remain a matter for the commissioner to [decide]. \u201cPublic hearings, as we have seen, are more difficult to conduct. They raise questions about reputational harm which are not faced when you hold private hearings and that is why most of these commissions\u2019 work has been done in private.\u201d Dreyfus said Labor would fund the Nacc with $262m over four years, $90m more than Coalition had promised. He committed to \u201cstrong parliamentary oversight\u201d of its funding, including a joint committee able to report on the sufficiency of its budget.", "NSW attorney general \u2018disappointed\u2019 by own government\u2019s lack of action over ice report [2022-08-22T09:00:07Z]": "The New South Wales attorney general, Mark Speakman, has revealed his frustration at his own government\u2019s failure to respond to a landmark report on ice addiction, saying he has spent \u201chundreds of hours\u201d trying to secure cabinet support for the reforms. It has been 30 months since Prof Dan Howard handed down the findings of the special commission into ice, commissioned by former premier Gladys Berejiklian prior to the state election in 2019. Appearing before a budget estimates hearing on Monday, Speakman said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the government\u2019s failure to respond, saying Howard\u2019s inquiry was \u201cfounded on extensive research and evidence\u201d.

But beyond immediately ruling out five recommendations, including pill testing and the abolition of drug dogs, the government has yet to formally respond to the report. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said for months that he is close to releasing a response, but declined to offer concrete timing. Speakman has previously called for a drug diversion scheme which would see people caught with small amounts of drugs face $400 penalties rather than be arrested.

With independents claiming 10 seats at May\u2019s federal poll, one of the key talking points heading into the Victorian election was whether the major parties would suffer a similar assault. But just like a mooted \u201cGreenslide\u201d failed to eventuate, the teal wave turned out to be barely a ripple.   Related: Victorian \u2018Greenslide\u2019 fails to eventuate but progressives on track for upper house balance of power    In fact, there\u2019s a high chance the number of independents in the state\u2019s lower house will drop from three to zero. Of four candidates supported by Climate 200, which helped fund the federal teals, only two remain in contention \u2013 Lardner in Mornington and Melissa Lowe in Hawthorn \u2013 but both trailed their Liberal opponent as counting continued on Sunday night. Meanwhile, two existing rural independents \u2013 Suzanna Sheed in Shepparton and Ali Cupper in Mildura \u2013 both lost their seats to the Nationals, who also claimed the seat of Morwell off retiring independent Russell Northe. Speaking to Guardian Australia on Sunday, Lardner \u2013 who trailed by just 177 votes at the time of writing \u2013 said there was a need for \u201cstructural reform\u201d of Victoria\u2019s campaign funding laws to make it \u201cmore of an even playing field\u201d. Under state laws that came into force for the first time this election, political donations are capped at $4,320 over a four-year period for a single donor. But nominated entities are exempt from the cap, meaning registered political parties can appoint an organisation that can receive donations. \u201cIndependents rely purely on individual donors who are restricted by a cap \u2026 I think that is unfair,\u201d Lardner said. Lardner also said \u201celection fatigue\u201d had played a role in the weekend\u2019s result. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly new and and but I think it\u2019s still very much growing and I think we\u2019ll continue seeing that for future elections \u2013 this Voices of movement,\u201d she said. Climate 200\u2019s founder, Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, said the tight margins in some seats showed community-backed independents were \u201ccompetitive\u201d but acknowledged the Andrews government was not \u201cas weak on climate change as the last federal government, nor was the leader as unpopular as Morrison\u201d.   Related: Victoria\u2019s Liberals need to define who they are before deciding who can lead them back from oblivion    \u201cIt is clear that even in a less favourable political environment, communities can mount very competitive campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state election was also climate and integrity election, in no small part due to community independents movement.\u201d Holmes \u00e0 Court pointed out that Lardner had run her campaign on a \u201cshoestring budget\u201d and stressed that independent candidates had to climb a \u201cpublicly funded $100m wall around the incumbents\u201d. \u201cKate\u2019s community built a ladder and got all the way to the top of the wall \u2026 if she doesn\u2019t make it, she\u2019s losing by only a few hundred votes,\u201d he said. He said the movement was still confident of having an impact on the New South Wales state election in March, where candidates would benefit from a more established history of independent MPs such as Zali Steggall, who in 2019 defeated the former prime minister Tony Abbottt in the seat of Warringah. Internal Climate 200 polling also showed stronger support for independents in NSW.", "Australia\u2019s inflation hits 7.3%, the highest level since 1990, with interest rates now likely higher for longer [2022-10-26T03:29:38Z]": "Australia\u2019s inflation rate accelerated in the September quarter as energy prices soared, heaping pressure on households and businesses and ensuring more interest rate rises to come. The consumer prices index (CPI) has risen 7.3% over the past year and increased by 1.8% in the July to September period, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. Economists had predicted annual CPI would quicken to 7% from the 6.1% pace reported in the previous quarter. The annual rate is the highest since June 1990, ABS data showed. At that time, the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s cash rate was 15%-15.5%, compared with 2.6% now.   Related: Federal budget 2022 summary \u2013 winners and losers: who will benefit and who was left behind?    Tuesday\u2019s federal budget tipped inflation to peak later this year at 7.75%. The RBA\u2019s target is to bring inflation back within its 2%-3% range over time. The budget also predicted the RBA\u2019s cash rate would peak at 3.35%. High inflation around the world has prompted most central banks to raise interest rates, in the most coordinated run of monetary policy tightenings in decades. The RBA became the first central bank of a rich nation to reduce the size of its rate rises when it lifted its cash rate by 25 basis points this month, snapping four consecutive rises of twice that amount. The September inflation numbers will likely foster expectations that the bank may lift the key rate higher for longer. The trimmed mean inflation figure, which strips out more volatile price movements and which the RBA looks at closely, quickened to a 6.1% annual pace from 4.9% in the June quarter.    Interactive   While borrowers might be redoing their sums today, shoppers are likely to be as well. The costs for non-discretionary items rose at an annual pace of 8.4% in the September quarter \u2013 up from 7.6% in the June quarter \u2013 to what the ABS dubbed \u201ca new high\u201d. These are essential items that consumers typically struggle to avoid buying, such as fuel and food staples. By contrast, discretionary items rose by a more modest 5.5% annual pace. CPI increase by 1.8% in the September quarter alone, driven by a 10.9% rise in gas prices. The cost of building new dwellings increased by 3.7% in the quarter and furniture, up 6.6%, was another big contributor. Gas prices are set differently in the country\u2019s west, where the Western Australian government reserves 15% for domestic use, and the east, where global markets set the price. Since gas is often the swing price in the wholesale power market, high prices for the fossil fuel also send electricity bills higher. The ABS said electricity prices rose 3.2% for the quarter, with subsidies such as WA\u2019s $400 power credit and smaller offerings in Queensland and the ACT helping to blunt the increase. \u201cExcluding the effect of these schemes, electricity would have risen 15.6% in the quarter,\u201d the ABS said. The September CPI figures offer some clues about the federal budget forecasts, released on Tuesday, that projected power prices would rise 20% later this year and a further 30% next year. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, in Tuesday told reporters that power prices, in particular, were a major concern. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that we\u2019re not worried about these electricity prices,\u201d he told reporters, blaming the war in Ukraine for \u201cplaying havoc\u201d with energy markets, along with what he called a decade of energy policy indecision.

The bank expects the RBA will lift the cash rate to 3.85%, up 25bp on its previous \u201cterminal\u201d rate.\u201cUnderlying and non-tradables inflation gained momentum in Q3,\u201d ANZ said. \u201cThese broad-based, domestically driven inflationary pressures are persistent and harder for the RBA to rein in, particularly given that the overall economy is in good health with solid household spending, strong business conditions and a substantial volume of unfilled labour demand.\u201d", "\u2018Isn\u2019t this the role of government?\u2019: Peter Dutton panned for setting up fundraiser for flood victims  [2022-02-27T07:44:43Z]": "Peter Dutton has been criticised for setting up a GoFundMe page for a flood-affected Queensland community, with one Labor MP suggesting it proved the Coalition was incompetent and couldn\u2019t deliver commonwealth support.

The fund was set up by the Coaltion in 2019, with the money to be spent on recovery and mitigation \u2013 but none of the fund has been allocated, with the government referring to it as a fund of last resort. Labor has pledged to revamp the fund to direct $200m a year to disaster prevention and resilience, such as flood levees, sea walls, cyclone shelters, evacuation centres, fire breaks and telecommunications improvements. In the 2021 budget the government announced a similar fund called the Prepare Australia fund, which committed $600m over six years for disaster resilience measures. Labor accused the government of continuing to sit on the emergency response fund which had \u201cdone nothing to help\u201d prepare the country for natural disasters. Morrison on Sunday said personal hardship assistance was being made available to flood-affected and evacuated communities in the Gympie and North Burnett areas.

On Monday Sydney reached 286.8mm of rain for October, the most in 165 years of record-keeping, with seven days of the month still remaining. October is the third month this year that Sydney has set a rainfall record, and Weatherzone reports Sydney\u2019s annual rainfall has reached 2387.6mm, easily its wettest year on record. Sydney also broke rainfall records in July (404mm) and March (554mm), with the yearly total also putting Sydney\u2019s 2022 total in the top five wettest years for any Australian capital city, beaten only by Darwin\u2019s total of 2776.6mm in a year. In the past 24 hours, 233mm has fallen at Alstonville, 215mm at Goonengerry and 196mm at Doon Doon, all in NSW. Dean Narramore, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said a low pressure system was bringing rain and storms to southern New South Wales, much of Victoria, eastern South Australia and northern Tasmania. \u201cWe could also see severe thunderstorms through the southern inland Queensland, inland New South Wales, with large hail damaging winds and heavy rainfall that could lead to flash flooding,\u201d he said.

Many towns are on track to experience their wettest Octobers, with 30mm-60mm predicted in the next day. Totals of 50-100mm are also likely along the Victorian ranges, with isolated totals in excess of 100mm possible. Renmark, just over the South Australian border, had received even more rain, with almost 100mm falling in 24 hours, or one-third of its average annual rainfall. It was the heaviest rainfall in the town\u2019s history, with records dating back to 1889. With 55.4mm already recorded in the town during October, the overnight falls made it the wettest month ever. The weather is expected to settle later in the week, with the Bureau forecasting conditions to ease in NSW and Victoria.  Heavy falls are expected across Tasmania on Wednesday and Thursday, but flood-affected regions in Queensland, inland NSW and Northern Victoria should see some respite by then.

A draft service framework for the new health-based response to public intoxication describes police as being responsible for delivering a \u201csecondary response\u201d when primary health workers are not available, including \u201cdue to limitations in geographic coverage and times\u201d. \u201cA secondary response will be provided entailing: Victoria police as the presumptive provider of outreach and transport, under their existing community safety role, where the primary response is unavailable,\u201d reads the framework, released as part of a tender process for service providers.   Related: Victoria to end public drunkenness laws with no new arrest powers for police    The Police Association of Victoria\u2019s secretary, Wayne Gatt, said he had not been informed of officers\u2019 role in the new model. He said while he was supportive of decriminalising public drunkenness, the plan as outlined in the draft framework would place a \u201cconsiderable burden\u201d on first responders. \u201cWhat do you call a \u2018second responder\u2019 who is called upon to act as the first response in an overwhelming majority of cases? A first responder,\u201d Gatt told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. \u201cWe told the government back in 2020 that retrofitting a complex health-based response model and infrastructure to a press release was an unwise way to govern on a complex social issue. \u201cRather than invest the time and money into developing a considered health-based response to those found drunk in public, they\u2019ve opted largely to stick with the status quo.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Under the new health-based response, intoxicated people will have to provide consent to receive assistance from the \u201cpublic intoxication service\u201d, which includes immediate support such as providing minor first aid, food and water, phone charging and support to locate friends or family. They can then be offered transport home or to a friend or family member\u2019s, another safe place or a sobering-up centre, where they will be monitored by health workers. Follow-up and referrals to other organisations may also be offered within 48 hours. The draft framework states police cells should be not used for the sole purpose of intoxication, and escalation to police \u201cshould only occur in exceptional circumstances where there is a real and immediate risk to community safety\u201d. The government committed to repealing public drunkenness laws in the wake of the inquest into the death of Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day in 2017, but the implementation of the response to replace the offence was delayed 12 months due to Covid-19. Nerita Waight, the chief executive at the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (Vals), said the government must guarantee the new model \u201cwill not involve Victoria police once it is fully implemented\u201d. \u201cIf Victoria police must have any role, including as a temporary measure while the public health model is rolled out to more regions of Victoria, their role must be strictly limited,\u201d Waight said. \u201cThe threshold for the involvement of Victoria police must be high, they should not have the power to detain someone in a public place when identifying a safe place where the person can sober up, and they should only be able to provide transport in strictly limited circumstances.\u201d Waight said if Victoria police do provide transport for an Aboriginal person who is intoxicated in public, they should be required to inform Vals\u2019 custody notification service.   Related: Decriminalisation of public drunkenness delayed by Victorian government    Data from Victoria\u2019s Crime Statistics Agency shows 3,181 public drunkenness offences were recorded across the state in the year ending June 2022.  The government is currently seeking registrations of interest to operate the new model, which includes a six-bed sobering-up centre in Melbourne for Aboriginal people and dedicated outreach services in cities and regional centres.  Victoria and Queensland are the only jurisdictions in Australia to still have a specific offence for public drunkenness, which the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody found had disproportionately affected First Nations people, and recommended that it be abolished. In January the government confirmed it would not be providing police with new arrest powers. On Tuesday afternoon a Victorian government spokesperson said the new health-led model prioritises the safety and wellbeing of intoxicated people and \u201chelp reduce deaths in custody\u201d. \u201cWe continue to \u2026 be guided by health experts, communities and services championing these reforms,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe know that existing public drunkenness laws have had a disproportionate impact on Aboriginal people in Victoria and are working with Aboriginal-led organisations and communities to provide culturally safe and appropriate services.\u201d", "At this gravest of times the Coalition has served up an election budget designed simply to keep itself in power | Katharine Murphy [2022-03-29T08:45:48Z]": "The opening flourishes of Josh Frydenberg\u2019s budget night speech certainly convey the gravity of our times. \u201cTonight, as we gather, war rages in Europe,\u201d the treasurer told parliament. \u201cThe global pandemic is not over.

But if we move from Frydenberg\u2019s rhetoric to content, we discover this budget isn\u2019t a serious plan for the future crafted by serious people in serious times. This is a plan for the next few months. This is a budget with one central objective: the re-election of the Morrison government in May.   Related: Federal budget 2022: Josh Frydenberg promises cash splash for households with billions on offer    With wages stagnant and consumer prices on the march, the Coalition\u2019s primary pre-election gift to voters is cash for Australia\u2019s low-and-middle income earners. As well as cash, the government will cut the fuel excise in half in the hope a price cut at the bowser isn\u2019t swallowed immediately by another adverse shift in the global oil price or an interest rate rise between now and September, when the excise is supposed to revert to its full rate. This \u201ctemporary\u201d assistance assumes there is some future benign political universe where either the current government, or a newly elected Labor one, can give Australians relief at the petrol pump, then take it away without incurring massive political pain \u2013 which has to be the working definition of the triumph of hope over experience. Let\u2019s believe the fuel excise reversion when we see it. And the cost of \u201cplease like me\u201d? More than $8bn over the next two years. The treasurer and the finance minister will say the following in their defence: most of the pre-election cash splash in this budget washes through. The spending isn\u2019t baked in and much of the revenue uplift from Australia\u2019s burgeoning post-pandemic economic recovery has been banked rather than spent. Both of these observations are true. Also true: had the Coalition done nothing in this budget to ease escalating cost-of-living pressures, they would have been belted politically. The government insists its cash splash won\u2019t feed inflationary pressures, which is obviously a significant risk to manage. But a pre-election handout north of $8bn is still a hefty price tag, however you look, however you measure. Speaking of hefty price tags, this budget also finally squares the accounts between Scott Morrison, a prime minister who last year needed to land a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, and Barnaby Joyce, a Nationals leader who wasn\u2019t inclined to sign up unless the terms were favourable. For graciously declining to humiliate Morrison at the Glasgow climate summit last year, Joyce has been rewarded with \u201ctransformational investments\u201d (read many, many billions) for dams, roads and regional communications infrastructure. \u201cThank you, Barnaby\u201d includes about $3bn for inland rail, as well as $7.1bn over 11 years to \u201cturbocharge the economies of four regional hubs across Australia\u201d. It\u2019s probably a coincidence (yes, that is irony) that these hubs are located in the Northern Territory (two marginal seats there), north and central Queensland (Labor has its eye particularly on the electorate of Flynn), the Hunter in New South Wales (where the Nationals would very much like to snatch a seat from Labor) and the Pilbara in Western Australia. This regional spend is north of $20bn over the medium term. I think the technical term for that is happy days on the Wombat Trail. Given that this budget is very obviously political, and in Coalition terms, measurably transactional, Frydenberg and Morrison will insist they are about more than surviving an election contest. I feel certain Exhibit A for future focus will be the national security spend \u2013 the magnificently named Redspice, which is (to quote the treasurer) \u201ca $9.9bn investment in Australia\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber capabilities\u201d and \u201cthe biggest ever investment in Australia\u2019s cyber-preparedness\u201d. The government says this initiative is all about meeting the challenges associated with the darkening geostrategic environment \u2013 which is very obviously a serious problem. But take a moment to read the fine print. You\u2019ll discover the investment to deal with this serious problem is loaded largely outside the forward estimates. The budget papers also make clear the expenditure will be \u201cpartly offset from the Defence Integrated Investment Program\u201d. In net terms, the outlay on Redspice over the next four years is actually $588.7m, not $9.9bn. Do remember that over the coming weeks, when Peter Dutton breaks out his loudhailer and throws down tests of patriotism out on the hustings. Speaking of loudhailers, the 2022 election contest is now in sight. It could be days away. It could be a couple of weeks away. But it is close enough now to be real. If we cast our minds back to 2007, when Labor was attempting to plot a pathway to government against an ageing Coalition government in whatever-it-takes mode, Kevin Rudd\u2019s cut-through political riposte was \u201cthis reckless spending must stop\u201d.   Related: Australian budget 2022: will voters be satisfied with a short-term cash splash?    Back then, Rudd savaged John Howard\u2019s \u201cirresponsible spending spree\u201d as a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to buy a fifth term in government. Back then, the Reserve Bank was warning about government spending fuelling inflationary pressures and interest rate rises. Audacious and supremely self-confident, Rudd backed himself to weaponise fiscal profligacy against Howard \u2013 to make the trinkets and tricks a symbol of a prime minister who cared more about the present than the future. That effort succeeded. But Anthony Albanese, ahead in the polls, and in small target mode, seems unlikely to adopt the Rudd playbook. Given that Australians are struggling with rising prices \u2013 this is probably safe politics. Safe, yes, but not entirely risk free. Given that there is palpable disenchantment out in voter land, and given that the prime minister is working around the clock to convince people to stick with the devil they know in uncertain times, safe politics does raise one question. Will Albanese present as sufficiently different from Morrison to be trusted by voters to chart a new course for Australia?", "Toondah Harbour developer says project won\u2019t harm bird habitat because species  [2022-10-12T06:32:05Z]": "The property developer Walker Group says its proposed Toondah Harbour development is unlikely to have a significant impact on the size of eastern curlew populations due to a substantial decline in the number of birds migrating to Australia. The analysis is contained in a long-awaited draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the apartment and retail project, which would see up to 3,600 dwellings constructed at the Ramsar-listed Moreton Bay wetlands in Queensland. The company said on Wednesday its EIS was based on the \u201cindisputable evidence of 11 independent scientists\u201d and the development would be a \u201cmajor economic and lifestyle boost\u201d that also protected the environment.   Related: To the moon and back with the eastern curlew    \u201cCrucially, scaremongering about negative environmental impacts to bird life, marine ecology and koalas has been proven wrong by the best, independent science,\u201d Toondah Harbour spokesperson Dolan Hayes said. Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the EIS was \u201cfantasy\u201d. \u201cThe idea that the birds will simply find somewhere else to go doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test. This isn\u2019t how nature works,\u201d she said. \u201cBirdLife Australia says the global population of eastern curlews has declined by 80% in the past 30 years, largely because similar commercial projects have been built across their range.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  Birdlife Australia, which has steadfastly opposed the development, said it was \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d that concerns raised by scientists had been described as scaremongering. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Paul Sullivan, said that if approved, the project would not only affect habitat for wildlife in Australia but would also have \u201cglobal ramifications by undermining the Ramsar treaty\u201d. The project proposes up to 3,600 dwellings, including apartments, shops and a hotel as well as a 200-berth marina. About 42ha of the development would be within the boundaries of the Moreton Bay Ramsar site, a wetland of international significance that provides habitat for migratory birds, including the critically endangered eastern curlew and great knot and the endangered lesser sand plover. Last week the federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, included the eastern curlew on a list of 110 priority species in a revamped threatened species action plan. In its assessment, Walker Group said the project would probably have a significant impact on the curlew because it would clear 28.9ha of tidal flat feeding habitat, about 0.29% of the available feeding habitat. However, the company assessed this was unlikely to lead to a long-term decrease in the size of eastern curlew populations because there had already been an 81% decline in the size of populations migrating to Australia in the past 30 years.   Related: The gym junkie of the sky \u2013 podcast    They said this meant Moreton Bay would still retain significant carrying capacity in available foraging habitat and it could be \u201creasonably expected\u201d the curlews and three other affected migratory birds \u2013 the great knot, the lesser sand plover and the bar-tailed godwit \u2013 would use other foraging habitat nearby. \u201cConsequently, the loss of 0.29% of tidal flat feeding habitat in Moreton Bay is unlikely to lead to a long-term decrease in the size of the eastern curlew population,\u201d the assessment states. O\u2019Shanassy said the mud flats at Toondah Harbour were an essential recuperation site when the birds touched down after their annual migration to the northern hemisphere and back. \u201cIt should be out of the question for a massive commercial project to be approved on the feeding grounds of a threatened migratory bird that has just been confirmed as a priority species,\u201d she said. Sean Dooley, of Birdlife Australia, said the notion that the area was not worth protecting because there were so few eastern curlews left \u201cexposes the brutal nihilism of the development at any cost mindset\u201d.   Related: Eastern curlews are a miracle of nature. And they are disappearing fast | Harry Saddler    \u201cAny possibility of the species recovering in the future is dismissed, so they ask us to accept the destruction of habitat that will be essential if the population of eastern curlews was to bounce back,\u201d Dooley said. Walker Group\u2019s assessment finds the site is also important for Cleveland\u2019s urban koala population but says the project will not have a significant impact on the endangered species. The company said an underpass would be built to remove the greatest threat of increased traffic and 1,000 new koala feed trees would be planted. The Toondah Harbour project has had a controversial history. In 2020, Guardian Australia revealed Walker Group lobbied the previous federal government to remove protections from an area of the wetlands as a matter of \u201curgent national interest\u201d. The draft EIS has been published for public consultation and submissions until 6 December.", "\u2018A clean slate\u2019: new agriculture minister sees climate action as Labor\u2019s chance to connect with the bush [2022-06-15T17:30:39Z]": "The Albanese government has a chance to break down the misconceptions between the Labor party and rural Australia, according to new agriculture minister, Murray Watt, who flagged the climate crisis as a key area in which to work towards common ground. \u201cThere have been some in Labor who have viewed rural Australia with suspicion and think that we can never get people to support us. Equally I think there\u2019s been people in rural Australia who have viewed Labor with suspicion,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of a clean slate here to work constructively with both the industry and rural areas, generally, around some shared goals. And I mean, climate change is a really good example of that.\u201d Watt said he was considering a new Landcare-style scheme to address the climate crisis and sustainability. It could build on the 30-year-old partnership between farmers and the environmental movement, which is a legacy of the Hawke government.   Related: What will the new Labor government do for rural and regional Australia?    \u201cWe\u2019ve got to the point where the National party was pretty unrepresentative of what real farmers actually wanted,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI think that if we manage climate change action and the push for sustainability in agriculture sensibly, I think that\u2019s an example of an issue where there\u2019s an opportunity to really build a strong partnership. \u201cAll the farm groups and individual farmers I\u2019ve met with, not just since taking on the portfolio, but even beforehand, they\u2019re up for this. They want to be part of this. Now we can turn the page and think about how we revamp some of these structures and mechanisms and bring farmers to the centre of it.\u201d Watt was also open to the idea of a national food strategy, as governments globally grapple with food security and supply chain issues. The Gillard government promised a national food plan in 2013 shortly before losing office, but it lapsed under the Coalition. The Food Policy Working Group in the agriculture department was abolished in the Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously growing concern about food security, particularly what\u2019s happening overseas and that is something I\u2019ve started thinking about.\u201d Watt committed to bring farm industry leaders, unions and First Nations people together to discuss solutions to the dire shortage in the agriculture workforce.   Related: \u2018Fair\u2019 development of renewables in regional Australia could eliminate future energy crises, report says    Labor has promised a dedicated agriculture visa stream under the established Palm (Pacific Australia Labor Mobility) scheme, effectively replacing the Coalition\u2019s new visa for the forestry, fishery, and farm industries, targeting workers from south-east Asia. The move angered farm groups even though no workers had arrived on the Coalition\u2019s scheme at the election. \u201cI\u2019m not dewy eyed about the potential of that to fix the problem,\u201d Watt said. \u201cBut, there\u2019s some incredibly interesting careers in agriculture, particularly on a permanent basis with the kind of technology that\u2019s coming in.\u201d He defended Labor\u2019s decision to phase out live sheep exports on the grounds of animal welfare and a loss of social licence by the live export industry \u2013 though Anthony Albanese has promised it would not happen before 2025. While the ban primarily affects Western Australian sheep farmers, Watt said it shouldn\u2019t spell the end of sheep farming but rather \u201cchange how the product is sent to market\u201d. \u201cThe primary motivation, obviously, is an animal welfare consideration. And I think unfortunately for the industry, it lost a lot of public support,\u201d Watt said.  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter        \u201cWhen you look at the numbers of exports, we\u2019re not not talking about a booming industry, and that, in part, reflects consumer demand changing as well.\u201d He pointed to Labor\u2019s promise of a $500m reconstruction fund to help the regions value add and develop food processing and manufacturing. \u201cEventually it could be used as part of this transition about live sheep exports. Potentially it could be used in the forestry sector to extract the most value from our forestry plantations,\u201d Watt said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fixed view about you know, exactly what regions or what products that can be used for, but I certainly want to make sure that we use it to lift productivity and ultimately lift jobs in the sector.\u201d Watt said he asked for a position with a connection to regional Australia. Most of his shadow roles had concentrated on regional areas, including portfolios of northern Australia, natural disaster and emergency management. His parents came from the Darling Downs and Mackay regions in Queensland, though he has been Brisbane-based. While the Labor party has its historical roots in the shearers strikes just prior to federation, Watt said he was not unrealistic about the relationship between Labor and the bush. Of Labor\u2019s 77 seats, Labor currently holds 13 seats classified as \u201cprovincial\u201d and six seats classified as \u201crural\u201d by the Australian Electoral Commission. Gilmore, also classified as rural, is still being contested. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pretend that every single person who is living in rural Australia is a potential Labor voter, but I think that being in government gives us a real opportunity to break down some of the misconceptions that exist between the Labor party and rural Australia.\u201d   Related: Breakthrough gene discovery could help prevent disease affecting 10% of world\u2019s crops    Watt said Labor had worked hard to rebuild trust and relationships in regional Australia after previous election losses, particularly the 2019 election. \u201cBeing a Queensland-based senator, I particularly needed to do that, after the wipeout that we suffered in the 2019 election but I feel quite optimistic about our relationships with farm groups and the sector generally, and with rural Australia overall.\u201d But he said Labor had been supportive of the Coalition\u2019s carbon and biodiversity pilot programs - which paid landholders for building carbon sinks and protecting habitat but would visit the trial sites to see how it was working. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive opportunity around the carbon market and reforming things like the emissions reduction fund, so that the average farmer can actually get involved and make a buck out of these sort of things.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community ", "Victorian minister trades barbs with Barnaby Joyce during joint press conference [2022-04-11T05:50:22Z]": "Victoria\u2019s transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, has given Barnaby Joyce a spray at their first meeting since the Nationals leader took over the federal infrastructure portfolio, telling him \u201cVictorians are Australian taxpayers as well\u201d.

The situation has created a concern that public hospitals will be badly affected during the coming flu season. \n\u201cNow that we have both Covid endemic in the community as well as flu ... that is driving a massive peak in demand on our emergency departments,\u201d Miles said. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nVictoria is also bracing for its first proper flu season in three years, with $54.9m to be spent on setting up modular emergency departments at Casey hospital in Berwick, Northern hospital in Epping and Werribee Mercy hospital. \nIndividual units will be built off-site and are expected to be completed in June, allowing for an additional 24 beds at the Werribee Mercy hospital and 12 beds at both Northern and Casey hospitals. \nAt a federal level, few significant reforms to health have been announced by either of the major parties during the election campaign, though Labor has promised $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. \nThe issue of hospital funding also hasn\u2019t been resolved.

On the face of it, the slowdown is not yet precipitous. The fund tipped global economic expansion in 2022 of 3.2%, or about half of last year\u2019s 6.1% spurt. The forecast is only 0.4 percentage points slower than its outlook in April. Next year\u2019s projection is for 2.9% global growth, down 0.7 percentage points from its earlier tip. But the caveat is the outlook remains \u201cextraordinarily uncertain\u201d.

Real estate, as it happens, may also be on Chalmers\u2019 worry list. According to the Australian research director for CoreLogic, Eliza Owen, property values in Sydney are down almost 5% since mid-February\u2019s peak. \u201cThis is the fastest decline in dwelling values across Sydney since the 1980s, when dwelling values fell 5.1% in the four months between October 1984 and February 1985,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps it is not all that surprising, given it is coming off the largest upswing in values since the 1980s.\u201d Melbourne\u2019s 3% decline from its peak over about four months is not quite at the pace of the post-Global Financial Crisis crunch in 2008. Nationally, property values have dropped 1.9% in a little under three months, Owen said, the biggest decline since the 1980s. But for now it\u2019s shy of the 8.4% fall between 2017 and 2019.

Dr Omar Khorshid will warn that substantial funding is urgently needed to address the crisis in the country\u2019s hospitals. The message from the Australian Medical Association president comes after Albanese called him on Thursday morning in response to the association criticising Labor\u2019s $135m urgent care clinic policy, announced this week, as \u201cincoherent\u201d. Albanese was in the marginal seat of Hunter on Thursday, announcing that one of the 50 clinics would be built in Cessnock to take pressure off the local hospital\u2019s emergency department. Khorshid told Guardian Australia he expected to meet with Albanese and the party\u2019s shadow health minister, Mark Butler, in the coming days about the party\u2019s health platform. He said the association had not been so far consulted on any of Labor\u2019s proposed health policies. He said while the urgent care clinics might be popular with the public, they would not make any difference to the pressure on emergency departments. He added that he would be encouraging Labor to be more \u201ccourageous\u201d on the issue of health.   Related: Labor to commit $135m to trial 50 urgent care clinics intended to ease pressure on hospitals    In the lead-up to the election, both major parties have told the association they will not commit to the 5% boost to public hospital funding being demanded by states as they deal with a \u201clogjam\u201d of patients \u2013 leading to ambulance ramping, and patients unable to be admitted for treatment. This 5% funding boost, which would lift the commonwealth\u2019s share of public hospital funding to 50%, would cost about $5bn a year. \u201c50-50 hospital funding has not been accepted by either party as part of their platforms, and we\u2019ve pushed it hard with both and we\u2019ve had \u2018noes\u2019 from both so far,\u201d Khorshid told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up just yet \u2013 which is why we\u2019re doing all this work, because we think it\u2019s a no-brainer, basically. And the states agree with us, so we\u2019ll keep pushing \u2026 But at this stage, we\u2019re not expecting it to be part of either party\u2019s announcements.\u201d Khorshid added that Labor had still not told the AMA what the party would be doing. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t include 50-50, unless we are amazingly successful in the next few days,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither party is interested.\u201d Khorshid said he would be asking Albanese \u2013 who has been pursuing a small target strategy, eschewing the multibillion policies Labor took to the last election \u2013 to \u201cstand for health\u201d. \u201cWe have not seen their vision for healthcare; we have seen a few small, piecemeal announcements,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that that will be a broad vision tackling the real problems, rather than a clinic here, a small thing there: marginal, seat-focused campaigns which might win elections, but won\u2019t fix the health system. \u201cIf [Albanese] can actually show that he stands for health, rather than spin and manipulating numbers and all this other stuff that the pollies normally do, [he needs to) actually stand up and say, \u2018We will pay for it and we will find a way to pay for it.\u2019\u201d Khorshid said that without the urgent injection of federal funds, which the AMA has said should be directed to increasing state hospital capacity, the crisis gripping Australia\u2019s hospitals will worsen. He warned this would be exacerbated by a surge in unmet demand for surgery which had been postponed as a result of the pandemic, as well as an ageing demographic. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a situation where you basically can\u2019t access low-urgency elective surgery in public hospitals. You\u2019ll just have to go private if you want a cataract or a hip replacement,\u201d Khorshid said.

In an interview with ABC\u2019s 7.30 on Monday, Morrison was asked to reflect on what he could have done differently including \u201cwhen it came to the way your government used community sports grants as a slush fund to channel money to marginal seats?\u201d Morrison said he rejected the charge, including for projects the subject of a scathing audit report that found half were not recommended by Sport Australia, with funding instead directed to marginal seats.

Not Sport Australia.\u201d Guardian Australia\u2019s Pork-o-meter has found the Coalition has again made billions of dollars of commitments to marginal seat projects, promising about $3bn to its top 10 target seats. Morrison pointed to a recent commitment made by the Coalition in the seat of Bass, in northern Tasmania, for a bowling green upgrade as an example of a community project that needed government help. \u201cWe\u2019re supporting them. Now, someone in Canberra may not understand how important that is. I can tell you what \u2013 they do, and Bridget Archer does, and I do. That\u2019s why we support it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t buy into this narrative that\u2019s put to us. Politicians, members of parliament, are part of their local community, they know what their community needs.\u201d Morrison was also pushed by host Leigh Sales about his assessment that he needed to be less of a \u201cbulldozer\u201d. She suggested voters were instead unhappy with him for \u201cducking responsibility, blame-shifting, being slippery with the truth [and] being slow to act when required\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re Labor\u2019s criticisms and that\u2019s not what I get,\u201d Morrison replied. \u201cWhat I get is people really just want to see me be more inclusive in terms of how I go forward and that\u2019s the challenge going forward.\u201d When asked to respond to specific criticism of the government doing \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d during the bushfire and floods crises and the vaccine rollout, Morrison defended the government and said criticisms from the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, were those of an \u201carmchair critic\u201d. Sales also asked the prime minister for his opinion on why the government was struggling in so-called teal seats with MPs vulnerable \u201cfor the first time\u201d \u2013 prompting Morrison to suggest the affluence of voters in these electorates was to blame. \u201cOur members have done an extraordinary job there, but as time has gone on, many of these places, I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I\u2019ve been in this campaign,\u201d Morrison said, pointing to the Ipswich-based seat of Blair in Queensland as an example, and \u201cbroader suburbs\u201d throughout the country. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re places that cannot afford the sort of risk that comes with a Labor party and a leader that just is a bit loose on the economy. They will pay the price for that. \u201cPerhaps some parts of our country may feel they\u2019re a bit more insulated from the impacts of that and may be focusing on other issues.\u201d On climate change, Morrison said that he did not accept that the net zero by 2050 target required Australia to shut down most of its coal-fired power stations by 2030, but refused to nominate a timetable. Morrison repeated his insistence that a vote for an independent would produce a \u201cparliament of chaos\u201d and would not be drawn on whether he would stand down to give a new leader a \u201cclean slate\u201d to negotiate in the event of a hung parliament. \u201cI\u2019m not speculating on these scenarios, Leigh. Because my scenario, the scenario that my team is working for, is not to have a weakened parliament, to not to have a government that has to negotiate for its existence every day.\u201d   Related: Dominic Perrottet downplays Coalition\u2019s bid for first-home buyers to access superannuation    Morrison also used the interview to spruik the government\u2019s new super for housing policy, saying he rejected suggestions that the policy could expose people to risk if the property market crashed. The policy, unveiled at the Coalition launch on Sunday, allows first homebuyers access to up to $50,000 of retirement savings for a house purchase, prompting warnings that house prices could spike as a result. Sales asked Morrison what would happen to people\u2019s retirement incomes if the housing market \u201ctanked\u201d. \u201cWhat you are suggesting is owning your own home is a gamble that Australians shouldn\u2019t take.

The note advised the troops to check the intranet for FAQ and email the people and culture help desk with any questions they may have. As there was little detail on who was in and who was out, staff had a lot of questions. Minutes later the ABC intranet crashed, leaving staff with nowhere to go with questions such as which managers were going to lose their jobs and where they would be moving. \u201cWe are working with the service provider to resolve this as soon as possible,\u201d the help desk said in an email as staff tried to access the FAQ. But some staff saw the funny side, emailing each other about the fiasco. \u201cThis is seriously hilarious 10 minutes after announcing a FAQ a restructure and redundancies lol,\u201d one email seen by Weekly Beast said. \u201cAll of us trying to work out which one of our bosses is getting the sack.\u201d    Tough at the top The ABC news director, Justin Stevens, who has expanded his empire to include regional bureaux and parts of radio, proudly told staff the reorganisation means there will be more women than men on the news executive team for the first time: Gavin Fang (deputy); Donna Field (news operations); Lee Glendinning (digital news); Suzanne Dredge (Indigenous); Jo Puccini (investigative journalism); Stuart Watt (news distribution).

Hopefully there are not too many women among them. Land of lost content The ABC has organised the corporation into two pillars, one called news and one called content, effectively removing the divisions of television and radio and scattering radio \u2013 now called audio \u2013 staff across both pillars, depending on whether they do news radio or current affairs radio. RN Breakfast with Patricia Karvelas, Drive with Andy Park and Background Briefing will move to news and all the others will move to content: Capital City Radio, Radio National, ABC Classic, Triple J, Double J, Triple J unearthed, ABC Country and ABC Jazz.    Back in 2017 the former ABC MD Michelle Guthrie sold a very similar-sounding restructure, promising to smash the silos of television and radio broadcasting and create a \u201cplatform-agnostic corporation for the digital age\u201d.   Related: ABC announces job losses amid biggest restructure since 2017    Guthrie created four pillars: news, investigations and analysis; local and regional; original content; and culture and entertainment. \u201cThe result will be extended reach and relevance, a better experience for our audience and an ABC that, in a fragmented landscape, provides the critical space for debate, dialogue and ideas,\u201d she said. Just six years later the four pillars have become two, along with another tranche of redundancies. Heading up the mega \u201ccontent\u201d division is a newly appointed television executive, Chris Oliver-Taylor, the former director of production for Netflix in Australia and New Zealand.

Greatly exaggerated death Earlier in the month news.com.au, Daily Mail Australia and 7news.com.au reported on the death of reality show contestant Dannii Erskine.

The stories were detailed and graphic. The Daily Mail: \u201cAs she went through a green light, a driver was intoxicated and T-boned her\u201d; \u201cShe was alive and taken to the Royal Melbourne hospital\u201d. The reports claimed her \u201cskull was crushed upon impact with the airbag\u201d and her \u201cinjuries [were] beyond repair\u201d. But soon after the stories were published they were followed up with more reports that Erskine was not in fact dead. \u201cAn Australian reality TV star who had reportedly died in a Melbourne car accident a few weeks ago may not be dead at all,\u201d news.com.au said.    \u201cDoubts have been raised about the death of Dannii Erskine after funeral arrangements had seemingly been organised.\u201d The news organisations based their erroneous reports on a reality TV podcast called So Dramatic which announced Erskine\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d on 1 May based on an email purporting to be from someone claiming to be Erskine\u2019s sister. There was also an Instagram post announcing she had died, which they all used: \u201cREST IN PEACE Dannii Erskine. 1995-2023\u201d. Erskine has since told the podcast her Instagram was hacked and she doesn\u2019t know who planted the hoax. All the original stories reporting her death were still live.

Sarah Michal was upset about overseas aid: \u201c$200m into Ukraine? Why are we helping a country and not our own backyard?\u201d Abo asked them if they had a message for the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who was coming up next on the show. \u201cThe quick message to him is I think you\u2019ve put the nail in the coffin,\u201d Corey said. \u201cCome next election, I\u2019d probably call on Australians to look elsewhere for your votes.\u201d    What Nine didn\u2019t tell viewers was that, according to his social media, Corey was an active Liberal party member and volunteer in 2016, helping his local candidate with door knocking and office support. It\u2019s not clear whether he\u2019s still in the party. Nine says they weren\u2019t aware of his political affiliations. \u201cWe had Corey on to talk about his tough experiences of dealing with the current cost-of-living crisis. We were unaware of any political affiliation and he did not have wonderful things to say about either of the two main parties,\u201d a Nine spokesperson told Weekly Beast. It\u2019s not the first time the couple have been on Today. They were interviewed complaining about a rise in interest rates two months ago. Hadley stays with Nine Sydney shock jock Ray Hadley has signed with Nine Radio for another three years, with a contract reportedly worth $9m extending to 2026.

The intensive care physician told Guardian Australia he was alarmed at the steep rise in cases of severe, end-stage alcohol-related disease he has seen \u201cin just a couple of years\u201d at the hospital. \u201cI have never seen so many jaundiced and confused 40 and 50-year-olds dying of liver failure,\u201d he said.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Alcoholic liver disease usually develops in severity over time in those who continuously drink. Acute alcoholic hepatitis can develop suddenly, causing liver failure and death. \u201cFor the past 12 months, the occupancy of ICU resources attributable to direct alcohol related critical illness is, at times, using up 25% of available resources,\u201d the physician, who did not wish to be named, said.   Related: Alcohol-induced deaths in Australia at their highest in 10 years    \u201cThat means a quarter of a tertiary teaching hospital ICU bed spaces, ventilators and life supports are being used by patients with alcohol-related illness including alcohol-related trauma and violence, self-poisoning including alcohol ingestion, chronic liver disease, pancreatitis, bleeding, and seizures. This is about 10 times the critical care burden attributable to Covid, on average, over the last three years at the hospital.\u201d He said other hospitals were also experiencing a similar burden. During the third Covid wave in mid-2022, a peak of 421 intensive care unit beds in Australia were being used by Covid patients, compared with 38 cases in intensive care beds on Tuesday. \u201cAlcohol-related critical illness is about 10% of ICU beds on average, year in year out, or about 200 ICU beds occupied beds every day,\u201d he said. \u201cOccasionally, it peaks at 25% in a single hospital on a given day, and some places like Alice Springs have a very high amount most days.\u201d The physician said he felt compelled to speak out after the release of Australian Bureau of Statistics deaths data on Thursday which revealed alcohol-induced deaths are at their highest rate in 10 years. These deaths are being driven by conditions that can be caused by long-term drinking such as trauma, late-stage liver disease, neurodegenerative diseases and heart failure. Alcohol-induced deaths in the ABS data are those definitively caused by excessive alcohol use, and do not include deaths that are alcohol-related, such as in cases where alcohol is a contributing factor but not the only factor. There is a perception that serious alcohol disease does not develop until after 70, the physician said. \u201cBut it takes you out well before that,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people younger than 60 who drink heavily, and perhaps without noticing they have gone from \u2018functioning\u2019 to experiencing symptoms which will baffle them. They have fewer friends, and they get socially isolated. There are fewer breaks in their drinking, they become more prone to getting infections and trauma. They go from having cirrhosis [liver scarring] to liver failure.\u201d He said that the social effects of Covid, that led to some people increasing their drinking, was one factor driving serious illness. He was also concerned about online deliveries that bring alcohol at any time of day, and loyalty programs that target people with advertising and rewards for buying alcohol, which he said \u201care very effective and make this an increasing problem\u201d. On Monday, a perspective written by public health researchers and published in the Medical Journal of Australia, described how Australian women age 45 to 64 are drinking more alcohol than ever before, \u201c\u2026 more than previous generations of women in this stage of life, and more than any other age group of women currently,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAlcohol, combined with their age, puts midlife women at increased risk of breast cancer.\u201d Breast cancer was the most common cancer affecting women in Australia, with alcohol accounting for 10% of diagnoses, they wrote. \u201cWe live in an \u2018alcogenic\u2019 society in Australia where alcohol is everywhere,\u201d the piece said.

Naden said she trusted Youpla because they gave the appearance of being an Aboriginal-run community organisation. \u201cThe idea of having a funeral fund for Aboriginal communities was something that I really took to, and thought was a good idea,\u201d she said.  \u201cI had my four daughters who were very young children at that time. I thought it\u2019d be good, just in case, to have them covered. \u201cI was committed to something that I thought gave me peace of mind. And then I turned around and found out there\u2019s no peace of mind whatsoever.\u201d Labor says if it wins government it will establish an inquiry to look into the role played by Youpla\u2019s directors and the bodies that regulated them \u2013 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and NSW Fair Trading. The party says it wrote to the government in 2019 warning that Aboriginal families would be \u201cripped off twice\u201d if Youpla collapsed. The government did not respond to the letter, the shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones said. \u201cClearly, whoever wins the next election is going to have to deal with this issue, and face up to the fact that the government has been negligent,\u201d Jones said. However, the Coalition says it \u201cfinally put a stop to ACBF and their predatory behaviour\u201d following the banking royal commission. \u201cMy first priority is that the people responsible are held accountable,\u201d the financial services minister Jane Hume said. \u201cTo this end, ASIC is taking legal action against ACBF alleging misleading and deceptive conduct.

[2022-04-11T05:25:32Z]": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been targeting Labor in the lead up to the 21 May election for a lack of policy detail, describing the opposition as a \u201ccompletely blank page\u201d. Labor, which ran an ambitious policy agenda at the 2019 election, has deliberately pared back its policy offering as part of a small-target strategy, but has announced several key policies that form the basis of its campaign. While Labor\u2019s official website boasts 24 different policies, the party\u2019s leader, Anthony Albanese\u2019s main focus has been on the care sector, including childcare, aged care, and Medicare. He has also been talking up policies to promote manufacturing in Australia, Labor\u2019s energy policy that will \u201cend the climate wars\u201d and more secure work as priorities. So what are Labor\u2019s key policies?   Related: The nerve centres: inside the Coalition and Labor election campaign headquarters    Aged care The centrepiece of Albanese\u2019s budget in reply speech was a pledge to fix the crisis in the aged care sector, with a promise to spend an extra $2.5bn in the sector if elected. He said Labor would also fund a wage increase for aged care workers and require residential aged care facilities to have a registered nurse on site 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The final price tag for the wage claim is not yet known given it is still to be determined by the Fair Work Commission, however, the Health Services Union estimates the cost of the full 25% wage increase, along with a staff increase of about 60,000 people, would cost $4bn a year. Further policies for the sector include criminal penalties and jail time for providers who cover up abuse of residents, a new duty-of-care and compensation scheme for breaches, an aged care commissioner to deal with complaints, an as-yet-undetermined spending cap on administration fees for home care, greater transparency on spending, and better food for residents. The aged care sector has welcomed the commitments, which fulfil recommendations made by the Royal Commission into aged care, but some groups have asked for more detail. Childcare Cheaper childcare is another of Labor\u2019s key campaign messages, with Albanese pledging to lift the maximum childcare subsidy rate to 90% for families for the first child in care, increase subsidies for single-child families earning less than $530,000, and extend the subsidy to outside school hours care. Labor says that most families will be better off under its reforms, which will cost $5.4bn starting from July 2023. According to the Grattan Institute, Labor\u2019s policy costs twice as much as the Coalition\u2019s recent childcare reforms, but will help more families and improve workforce participation.   Related: Australian election 2022: seat explorer    \u201cIt supports more families and would have much larger and more widespread economic benefits. It would bring down out-of-pocket costs and sharpen workforce incentives for a much wider group of families,\u201d Owain Emslie from the Grattan Institute says. Medicare Labor has pledged to change the rules to allow regional and outer metro communities to recruit more doctors of their choosing, including overseas GPs, to help address a skills shortage that is worsening in regional Australia. While \u201cmaking it easier to see a doctor\u201d has been a key message from Albanese in recent months, the policy detail is yet to be announced, with this still expected during the election campaign. Climate and energy policy Promising to \u201cend the climate wars\u201d is another of Albanese\u2019s election pledges, with the policy previously proving to be a vexed one for Labor, particularly in coal seats in New South Wales and Queensland. Labor has set an emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030, compared to the 26 to 28% promised by the Coalition, and will boost the share of renewables in the national electricity market to 82% if it forms government. Under its \u201cpowering Australia\u201d plan, Labor will also upgrade the electricity grid to improve energy transmission, invest $3bn in green metal production and other carbon reducing measures and roll out solar banks and community batteries. Secure jobs and skills Labor says it will fund up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023, and provide access to 465,000 free Tafe places in nominated areas of skills shortages under a $1.2bn policy aimed at securing jobs. It says fee-free Tafe places in targeted areas will help rebuild the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, like hospitality and tourism, as well as meeting current and future needs in the care economy, including jobs in childcare, aged care, disability care, nursing and community services.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning       Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   The funding will include 45,000 new Tafe places. As part of its pledge for more secure jobs, Labor is also promising \u201csame job, same pay\u201d legal protection for contractors, more security for gig economy workers and to make wage theft illegal. Industry and employer groups have rejected much of what Labor is proposing, saying it will remove flexibility from the workforce and impose large costs.  Manufacturing Albanese says he wants Australia to be a \u201ccountry that makes things again\u201d and has pledged to establish a $15bn national reconstruction fund if elected.   Related: Pork-o-meter: tracking Australian election spending announcements    The fund would be modelled on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, meaning the initial $15bn capital injection would stay off the government balance sheet to be provided through a combination of loans, equity, co-investment and guarantees.

Albanese says the fund would put Australia back on a path to \u201cmake cars, trains and ships\u201d as part of a manufacturing revival. It has also pledged to establish a Future Made in Australia Office, backed up by laws, that would leverage the commonwealth\u2019s multi-billion procurement budget to actively support local industry.", "Disaster agency defends not listing Lismore as flooding priority area for funding [2022-03-01T16:30:19Z]": "The national disaster recovery and resilience agency has defended its decision to omit Lismore from its priority areas for flood mitigation funding just three months ago, as the city battles record floods. The local Coalition MP has criticised the omission as \u201ccrazy\u201d and said he expected the issue would be resolved for funding applications in future. Round one of the Preparing Australian Communities Program (PACP) was announced in November, offering grants of between $20,000 and $10m for local disaster projects. The National Resilience and Recovery Agency (NRRA) said projects would be selected which would \u201cassess and plan for disaster risk, increase capacity and raise awareness of disaster risk, or that deliver resilient infrastructure.\u201d   Related: Ballina flood: residents of NSW coastal town face tense night as flood peak expected to coincide with high tide    The funding was \u201copen to all local government areas across Australia\u201d NRRA coordinator-general, Shane Stone said, but the agency identified dozens of \u201cpriority\u201d LGAs in areas particularly prone to bushfires, floods or tropical cyclones. These places were automatically granted extra points under the assessment process. Lismore, one of the most flood-prone areas in Australia, was not classed as a priority area. Hundreds of residents were rescued on Monday as flood waters peaked at 14.4 metres, two metres higher than the previous record. Previously, the worst flooding event in the region occurred in February 1954 when flood waters rose to 12.27 metres. Another flood in March 1974 saw the river rise to 12.15 metres. Nationals MP Kevin Hogan, whose electorate of Page covers Lismore, told the ABC in November it was crazy the town was not considered a priority under the flooding program. \u201cIt needs to change, and I\u2019ll be doing everything I can to get those LGAs put in,\u201d he said at the time. Hogan said on Tuesday he had been in contact with the NRRA and the issue had been fixed. His office did not respond to requests for further clarification about whether this meant Lismore would be classed as a flood priority area for future funding rounds.   Related: Lismore counts the devastation as Ballina braces for its worst flood in history    The Preparing Australia Program was announced in May 2021, with $600m to be allocated for reducing disaster risk over six years to 2026-27, in response to recommendations of the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements. Applications for round one of the PACP only closed in January, and no grants have yet been announced, so it is unclear if Lismore was awarded funding under the program. In response to Guardian Australia\u2019s questions about why Lismore had been left off the initial priority list, and whether it had since been added after community representations, an NRRA spokesperson said the agency was not able to comment on specific applications during the assessment process. Under the PACP, applications are assessed by the NRRA and given a score out of 100 points.

The Australian Climate Service, the NRRA itself, and state and territory governments also had input. In December, Stone stressed that applications outside priority LGAs could still be successful in seeking funding. \u201cProjects will be funded based on merit, so a local government area that isn\u2019t listed as a priority location is still eligible to receive a share of the $150m available under this round, if they put forward a strong application that meets all the criteria,\u201d he said at the time.

The Grattan Institute on Sunday released a damning report examining the way successive governments have used transport spending promises to further their political interests. The report found due diligence was overwhelmingly lacking in transport promises made during election campaigns. At the last election, just one of the 71 Coalition transport promises worth $100m or more was based on a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia.   Related: South Australia election: Labor win should have Morrison government \u2018trembling\u2019, ALP says    Labor had business cases for just two of the 61 transport funding announcements it made during the same campaign. The report found a \u201clong and bipartisan history\u201d of pork-barrelling transport funding. Since 2004, under two Labor and four Coalition terms of government, the report said there had been a \u201cpersistent pattern\u201d of sending more transport dollars to New South Wales and Queensland, states which often decide federal elections. It also found the urban congestion fund \u2013 the government\u2019s much-criticised discretionary funding program for roads and carparks \u2013 overwhelmingly went to marginal seats. On average, a marginal urban seat received $83m from the fund and a safe Coalition seat received $64m. Safe Labor seats received just $34m on average, the report found. Report author Marion Terrill described pork-barrelling in transport funding as an \u201carms race\u201d. The quantum being promised by both parties jumped significantly between the last two elections. In 2016, the Coalition promised $5.4bn in transport spending, compared to Labor\u2019s $6.7bn. By 2019, that had jumped to $42bn for the Coalition and $49bn for Labor. Terrill said the federal government should concentrate its efforts on nationally-significant infrastructure, rather than hyper-local projects \u2013 roundabouts, overpasses, and carparks, for example. The government should also only fund such nationally significant projects after proper due diligence, she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important about transport is that the dollars involved are really big, so when politicians engage in pork-barrelling with transport funding, there\u2019s an awful lot at stake,\u201d Terrill said.

Ministerial standards can be used, but only at the prime minister\u2019s discretion. Australia\u2019s electoral laws \u2013 while prohibiting someone providing, receiving, or offering benefit to influence a vote \u2013 do nothing to stop a party promising to spend public money to advance its own political advantage. Criminal sanctions exist for abuse or misconduct of public office, but they are rarely pursued, the report says. \u201cOn the other hand, there is plenty of political upside. The louder the media and public criticism of pork-barrelling, the stronger the \u2018evidence\u2019 that ministers are delivering for their communities. Indeed, the criticism arguably is the communications strategy: what\u2019s the point of spending millions on a local project if the locals don\u2019t know about it?\u201d", "Karen Andrews seeks to block funding for Gold Coast light rail that would run past her property [2022-05-16T17:30:35Z]": "The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, has sought to block federal funding for a Gold Coast light rail expansion that would run directly past an investment property she co-owns with her husband. \nLast week Andrews wrote an open letter to residents of the Gold Coast suburb Palm Beach saying she had requested the federal urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, oppose any federal funding for the fourth stage of the city\u2019s light rail project \u2013 a proposed extension from Burleigh Heads to Coolangatta. \nThe move \u2013 on the cusp of a federal election \u2013 ended bipartisan support for the three previous stages of the light rail, and prompted an angry response from the long-serving Gold Coast mayor, Tom Tate, who declared: \u201cI have never been this disappointed in the political arena.\u201d \nAndrews, who is the local MP, said while she still supported the extension to Coolangatta, the route chosen by the state government and the local council, along the Gold Coast highway, was \u201cnot tenable\u201d. \n\u201cI\u2019ve not met one local resident who thinks that reducing the Gold Coast highway to one lane each way to accommodate light rail is a good idea,\u201d she said. \n \n  Related: Labor \u2018gravely concerned\u2019 by Karen Andrews\u2019 claim about potential China election interference  \n \nTitle records obtained by Guardian Australia show Andrews and her husband, Chris, own a unit in a complex on the Gold Coast highway, along the proposed light rail route. Andrews made no mention of the property when announcing her opposition to the light rail extension. \nHowever, in her declaration of interests lodged with the federal parliament, Andrews publicly lists her ownership of an investment unit at Palm Beach. Such declarations require an MP to list the suburb or area of a property they own, but not the address. There is no suggestion Andrews has breached any disclosure rules. \nIn her letter to residents, Andrews said she had written to Fletcher to ask \u201cno federal funding be directed to this project as it stands\u201d. \nIn a subsequent interview with the ABC, Andrews said she was \u201cabsolutely sympathetic and empathetic to the people of Palm Beach who feel they have not been listened to\u201d. \n\u201cI will not sit by while their views are steamrolled,\u201d she said. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nGuardian Australia asked the home affairs minister whether she had mentioned her property interest when she asked Fletcher to place a block on federal funding. \nIn response, Andrews said she would \u201ccontinue to voice the concerns of Palm Beach residents\u201d. \n\u201cLast year 81% of 1,376 local McPherson residents surveyed did not support light rail continuing along the highway in its current form,\u201d she said. \n\u201cAll levels of government need to listen to locals and engage in constructive consultation about a considered approach to public transport \u2013 whether it\u2019s heavy rail to the airport, electric buses, or any other types.\u201d \nThe Gold Coast light rail project, initially built for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, has been jointly funded by local, state and federal governments. The first two stages have been completed, linking Helensvale and Broadbeach. \nWork on the third stage extending the line south to Burleigh is about to commence. The final extension, from Burleigh to Coolangatta, is in the planning stages. \nSome residents of the southern Gold Coast are opposed to the extension, claiming it is unnecessary, would result in high-rise development, and would remove parking along the Gold Coast highway. More than 20,000 people have signed a petition opposing the project. \nBut even opponents were left surprised by Andrews\u2019 letter to residents last week. The founder and president of Save Our Southern Gold Coast, Kath Down, told the Gold Coast Bulletin that she felt Andrews had \u201cdefinitely backflipped\u201d. \nLong-term residents and residential property owners have expressed concern that reducing the Gold Coast highway to a single lane in some places would create ongoing traffic problems. Construction works are expected to take several years. \nA flyover animation showing what the rail project could look like shows the highway cut back to one lane outside the unit complex where Andrews owns her investment property. \nGuardian Australia spoke to a resident of the apartment complex, who said the highway was already \u201cvery congested\u201d, and that traffic often banked up outside the building during peak hour. \n\u201cIf it goes down to one lane then access in here will be a nightmare,\u201d the resident said. \nThe 28-unit complex \u2013 which is a mix of owner-occupiers, long-term leaseholders and holiday rentals \u2013 has a single driveway entrance that can only be accessed from the highway. \nThe state government and the Gold Coast council say their preferred route is along the highway \u2013 three other options were ruled out because they would require property acquisitions to widen residential streets. \nThe Queensland transport minister, Mark Bailey, called on Andrews to state her preferred route prior to the election. \n\u201cIf Ms Andrews chooses any of the three routes through Palm Beach, then hundreds of homes would have to be resumed \u2026 and those residents deserve to know if she wants to take their homes now, not after the election,\u201d Bailey said.", "\u2018It\u2019s the vibe\u2019: 25 years on, how The Castle became an Australian classic [2022-03-18T19:00:08Z]": "Practically every Australian has a favourite line from The Castle.

The Castle trailer    For some, the most well-known and consequential of the numerous catchphrases of the film comes from the courtroom scene where Denuto flails haplessly for a legal authority to support his client\u2019s case. \u201cIt\u2019s the constitution, it\u2019s Mabo, it\u2019s justice, it\u2019s law, it\u2019s the vibe,\u201d says Denuto. \u201cIt is rare that popular culture and the high court intersect,\u201d says George Williams, a law professor at the University of New South Wales. \u201cNever have they done so more spectacularly than with The Castle. The movie places the high court at the centre of a David and Goliath battle that taps into deeply held Australian values around fairness and home.\u201d Williams says that under the real law of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution (which prohibits the federal government compulsorily acquiring land other than \u201con just terms\u201d), the Kerrigans would have lost. The opposite outcome however, he says, made for a better storyline.    One reason for the film\u2019s cult status is that its producers, Working Dog, have left The Castle to a life of its own. They have largely refused to speak publicly about the film; executive producer Michael Hirsh declined an interview request from Guardian Australia. In an interview last year with Radio New Zealand while promoting the TV series Utopia, Hirsh\u2019s Working Dog colleague Rob Sitch said, \u201cI think in some ways the smartest thing we did was stay out of the way. It\u2019s been a gift that keeps on giving for us.\u201d The movie is often repeated on Channel Nine and is available to stream on Stan. \u201cWhat is so refreshing about The Castle is its profound Australianness,\u201d says William MacNeil, an honorary professor at the University of Queensland and leading expert on law and culture. MacNeil says the film corrected the cultural cringe that had previously seen Australian audiences more familiar with US or British legal dramas. \u201cIndeed, Denuto makes so much of its \u2018vibe\u2019 that the Australian constitution \u2013 hitherto unknown in terms of its dramatic possibilities \u2013 practically becomes a leading character in the film.\u201d  In turn, the amorphous \u201cvibe\u201d has permeated the typically rarefied language of the legal world. The concept has found its way into many legal arguments, including in numerous hearings before the high court. Denuto\u2019s famous submission was quoted in a NSW court judgment in 2010, while a Queensland lawyer sued for $250,000 in defamation damages after being described as \u201cDennis Denuto from Ipswich\u201d (he lost).    Such is the movie\u2019s resonance within the law that it was the only film to gain an entry in the Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia. In a rare break from his silence around the film, the entry was written by Sitch, who directed and co-wrote The Castle. \u201cIt is a sweeping saga that takes the harsh Australian outback, the rugged characters of the Anzac legend, the spirit of Banjo Paterson and ignores them in favour of a greyhound-racing tow truck driver who never meant to be a hero,\u201d he jests. In the written entry, Sitch also takes aim at the high court authorities, who refused to permit filming inside the brutalist court building in Canberra. Instead, the courtroom scenes were filmed in Melbourne, before a quick trip to Canberra to film outside the high court. Mora recalls the filming was done on a freezing Canberra Saturday, with local journalists press-ganged into being extras. \u201cThat added authenticity,\u201d he chuckles. But The Castle, released five years after the high court\u2019s landmark decision in Mabo, also contained a more serious message. \u201cThe film was not just brilliant entertainment,\u201d says Emeritus Professor Tony Blackshield from Macquarie Law School. \u201cIts real social function was to communicate a deeper social understanding of the importance of Mabo.\u201d    The very powerful underlying theme of the film is about justice, and that\u2019s justice for all, not just for some people  Tiriel Mora     Blackshield suggests that the scene where Darryl Kerrigan exclaims that his predicament has helped him understand how Indigenous Australians feel about dispossession \u201cis the central point of the film\u201d. (In another scene, Denuto somewhat mischaracterises Mabo in a legal argument: \u201cThat\u2019s your classic case of big business trying to take land \u2026 and they couldn\u2019t.\u201d) The movie was released at a time of increasingly fractious national discourse, after Mabo and the Native Title Act had recognised that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities had legal rights to land. \u201cThe film becomes this wonderful intervention, that flips this idea of home and country and land into a language that becomes identifiable [to mainstream Australian audiences],\u201d says Professor Kieran Tranter, chair of law, technology and future at Queensland University of Technology. At a time when rightwing politicians and newspapers were arguing against native title, The Castle \u201csold a story to a nervous nation that was quite reassuring\u201d, says Tranter. Mora suggests The Castle\u2019s political message was \u201cpointed and yet subtle\u201d (although he acknowledges, laughing, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d). \u201cThe very powerful underlying theme of the film is about justice, and that\u2019s justice for all, not just for some people,\u201d continues the actor. By using an ordinary suburban family as the vehicle, Mora suggests, it made \u201cbigger questions of injustice to first Australians more approachable\u201d. These remain live political issues (including before the high court). \u201c[The Castle] touched on a very significant conversation that we are still having,\u201d Mora adds. Whether it would be considered appropriate today to make a film indirectly addressing Indigenous issues with a largely white cast is questionable. \u201cThere are a lot of problems talking about [Indigenous] stories without having [Indigenous] representation,\u201d admits Tranter. Asmi Wood, a Torres Strait Islander and professor at the Australian National University College of Law, says The Castle has withstood the test of time. An expert on Indigenous legal issues, Wood often discusses the film with first-year law students and is full of praise for its subtle political message. \u201cTo make people understand that there is another group of people who might feel alienated, for different reasons and different circumstances, but to create that level of empathy, I think the film is absolutely brilliant,\u201d he says.  But for all The Castle\u2019s cultural commentary, legal legacy and political purpose, it remains popular because it guarantees a laugh. \u201cI think it was very funny,\u201d says Wood.", "Australian universities split on decision to adopt controversial definition of antisemitism [2023-02-05T14:00:24Z]": "Australian universities are split on whether to adopt a controversial definition of antisemitism following a push from parliamentary MPs that has been criticised as an \u201coutright attack on academic freedom\u201d.

A source who wished to remain anonymous told Guardian Australia there had been no consultation with academics at Macquarie University before the definition was included into its Equity, Diversity and Inclusion policy over the summer of 2021. Macquarie University was approached for comment. The University of Wollongong said it adopted the definition in April and said it would have no impact on \u201cacademic freedom and freedom of speech\u201d. \u201cInstead, it is a reference for our community members to help understand what may constitute antisemitism,\u201d the university said.

The poll of 1,000 voters conducted by the Australia Institute found that 52% want the $84m cut from the ABC in the last three years to be restored, more than double those who oppose it (25%). Despite being elected after promising no cuts to the ABC and SBS, the Abbott government reduced funding to the ABC in the 2014 budget, with a further pause in the indexation of funding imposed in 2018 under Malcolm Turnbull.   Related: John Howard and the ABC: desire for cuts came up against Liberal support for broadcaster    There have been $526m in cuts to the ABC budget since 2014, with an ongoing reduction to base funding of $106m per year by 2021-22, the ABC has told Senate estimates in reply to questions on notice. In that time, the ABC has slashed 640 jobs, from 4,704 staff to 4,064. In addition to staff cuts, the ABC\u2019s savings have come from discontinuing the 7.45am radio news bulletin, reducing spending on independent production and discontinuing ABC Life. The poll shows despite a majority of voters backing increased ABC funding, the issue is polarised along party lines. Coalition voters narrowly favoured increased funding, with 43% in favour and 36% opposed, whereas Labor and Greens voters had solid majorities of 65% and 63% in favour and just 17% an 16% opposed. Support for more ABC funding is highest in Victoria (57% in favour) and New South Wales (54%), whereas in Queensland 44% wanted increased funding and 29% were opposed. The Australia Institute poll found that 61% of respondents agreed that \u201ca strong, independent ABC is critical to a healthy democracy\u201d with only 19% disagreeing. In the 2021 budget the Morrison government gave an extra $30m to SBS, but the ABC copped a $10m reduction in its operational funding from $880.56m in 2021-22 to $870.34m in 2022-23. In 2020 the independent thinktank Per Capita did a report for progressive lobby group GetUp estimating that total funding cuts to the ABC totalled $783m since 2014.

The custody notification service, run by the Northern Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (Naaja), was established in 2019 and received three years\u2019 funding from the federal government, on the understanding that the NT government would take over paying for the service from 2022 onward. But no funding agreement has been signed. Stephen Karpeles, who manages the service at Naaja, said that a failure to provide long-term funding arrangements, particularly in the wake of the high-profile acquittal of an NT police officer over the fatal shooting of an Aboriginal man, would \u201csay fairly clearly that black lives don\u2019t matter\u201d.   Related: Yoorrook Justice Commission: how will truth-telling process work and what will it achieve?    \u201cThe whole point of the service is to recognise the importance of protecting Aboriginal people when they\u2019re in police custody,\u201d he said. \u201cTo remove the funding for the service at a time when Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are already very apprehensive about their relationship with police would send completely the wrong message.\u201d The custody notification service is a 24/7 telephone line that police are required to ring if they take an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person into custody. It conducts a welfare check and provides legal advice. This is particularly necessary in the NT, says Karpeles, because it is the only Australian jurisdiction where police are not required to expressly tell people in custody they have a right to see a lawyer. A spokesperson for the federal minister for Indigenous affairs, Ken Wyatt, said his government was \u201cconsidering its position on the future funding of Custody Notification Services, which will be communicated to providers and key stakeholders in due course\u201d. They reiterated that the initial funding offer was for three years. A spokesperson for the Northern Territory attorney general, Selena Uibo, said the Territory \u201ccontinues to lobby the federal government for funding for this program\u201d. In 2016 the Australian government offered to fund the first three years of Custody Notification Services in each state and territory without an existing service. This offer was conditional on jurisdictions mandating police use of the CNS in legislation and a commitment by jurisdictions to take on full funding responsibility after the first three years. The Northern Territory and Western Australia governments agreed to the offer. In the NT, the CNS has assisted more than 16,000 people in the past three years, including children as young as 10. It has six full-time staff. Naaja said it needed to hire more staff to meet demand, but hiring skilled staff on a three-month contract was difficult. Karpeles said changes to the bail act, introduced last May, had seen a tripling of the number of children under 12 who were taken into custody, and a doubling of children aged 12 to 18. Those changes were introduced following a series of news reports about an alleged youth crime wave. The huge jump in children being detained made the service even more important, said Karpeles. \u201cOur service has been in operation for three years and we\u2019re required to be notified every time a youth is arrested \u2013 an Aboriginal youth, that is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not seeing this increase that was being spoken about in our data. It just simply wasn\u2019t there. But now that the bail laws have been amended we have seen a huge increase \u2013 a doubling across youths and a tripling of youths under 12.\u201d   Related: Indigenous deaths in custody worsen in year of tracking by Deaths Inside project    The Northern Territory has the highest rates of Indigenous incarceration in the country, and it\u2019s geographically complicated. People are often arrested and removed from their home community, or told to attend court in a regional centre when they don\u2019t have access to transport. It\u2019s also a multilingual community, and there\u2019s no legal requirement for police to provide access to a translator. Through the CNS, Naaja is able to ensure the person under arrest understands their rights and also what is expected of them in terms of future court dates and bail conditions. \u201cWe are speaking to people for whom English is a fourth or fifth language all the time \u2013 probably every second or third person we speak to,\u201d Karpeles said. Placing a legislative requirement on police to contact the local Aboriginal legal service whenever a First Nations person was taken into custody was a recommendation of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1991. It was introduced in NSW in 2000 and in 2016 the federal government promised three years of federal funding to other jurisdictions which introduced the scheme.

The Aboriginal legal service in Western Australia said its funding was also due to expire in June, and it had not received any information about funding being extended. \u201cIt is the State Government\u2019s expectation that the Commonwealth will announce ongoing Federal Government funding for the Custody Notification Service, with an announcement due in April,\u201d WA attorney general, John Quigley, said.", "Nurses are the solution to bulk-billing crisis, says peak body [2022-08-15T17:30:35Z]": "Doctors are \u201cgatekeeping\u201d conversations surrounding affordable access to healthcare, leaving nurses and their highly specialised skills undervalued and underutilised, peak nursing bodies say. The cost of access to basic healthcare is a pressing problem for many Australians, with an increasing number of general practitioners limiting access to bulk billing or scrapping it altogether. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Australian Medical Association say extended freezes to the Medicare rebate, and a below-inflation 1.6% increase for most GP services from 1 July  means it is unfeasible for GPs to continue to bulk bill.   Related: Why is my doctor no longer bulk billing and is Medicare in crisis?    Doctors want the federal government to significantly increase the rebate, and to do more to attract medical graduates to general practice. But the president of the Australian College of Nursing Practitioners, Leanne Bose, said not enough was being done by government to increase the role of nurses in providing affordable primary healthcare. In New Zealand nurse practitioners, like general practitioners, can assess and treat patients, and provide prescriptions. In the US patients are encouraged to see nurse practitioners for many common illnesses and long-term conditions, and can often get appointments more quickly and affordably than with a GP. A nurse practitioner is a registered nurse with additional training to diagnose and treat people with acute or chronic health conditions. \u201cInternationally, nurse practitioners are valued as highly intelligent, flexible and critical thinkers, and they can step up and provide the services the most vulnerable people need,\u201d Bose said.   Related: Creating a genuinely universal Medicare will require politically difficult actions | Jennifer Doggett    In Australia, Bose said, the Medicare item numbers and rebates available to nurse practitioners were inadequate, limiting their scope to provide affordable care. While patients don\u2019t need a referral to see a nurse practitioner, doctor approval is needed for the patient to receive a Medicare rebate for the consultation, so most patients have to pay. Nurse practitioners also require authorisation from a doctor to issue subsidised prescriptions. \u201cRequiring authorisation has nothing to do with our expertise or training, and everything to do with controlling the healthcare dollar,\u201d Bose said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully utilise the nurse practitioners we do have by allowing them to provide healthcare, especially to vulnerable people, and it is absolutely abhorrent.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   The strengthening Medicare taskforce announced by the federal government to examine ways to make healthcare more accessible and affordable does not have any nurse practitioners on its expert panel.

Related: The John Barilaro factor: former NSW deputy premier becomes focal point in state campaign    Months after Barilaro\u2019s appointment as a senior trade commissioner caused a storm of controversy in Macquarie Street, the cross-party parliamentary inquiry issued a scathing assessment of the process which led to him receiving the $500,000-a-year position. \u201cDespite assurances from senior public servants and ministers that the appointment process was conducted by the public service under a merit based process, it is clear that the process was flawed and that the Executive was not at arm\u2019s length from the process,\u201d the inquiry chair, Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, said in the report.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The saga gripped the government for months last year after revelations by Guardian Australia that Barilaro\u2019s job had been offered first to the senior businesswoman and former public servant Jenny West. The verbal offer from the agency charged with filling the role, Investment NSW, was withdrawn a month later. Ayres left cabinet after a separate report commissioned by the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, raised concerns he may have breached the state\u2019s ministerial code of conduct by having \u201cinput\u201d into the shortlisted candidates during the hiring process. That report, conducted by the former NSW public service commissioner Graeme Head, found the appointment had not been conducted at arm\u2019s length from the government. Ayres was later cleared of any wrongdoing over the saga in another report, paving the way for his return to cabinet should the Coalition be returned to government at the March election. After the report\u2019s release on Monday, Perrottet took aim at the inquiry, calling it a \u201cpolitical committee\u201d. \u201cLabor\u2019s focused on politics, I\u2019m focused on fixing problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political committee.

I will listen to an independent former inspector of the Icac than Labor and the Greens in a political committee.\u201d Despite previously conceding Barilaro\u2019s appointment was not at arm\u2019s length from government, Perrottet sought to dismiss those concerns on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear in the report from the former inspector of the Icac \u2026 that was dealt with by the former inspector of the Icac, they can play politics I\u2019m focused on fixing problems,\u201d he said. But the parliamentary inquiry, which was made up of a majority of Greens, Labor and crossbench MPs, took aim at his involvement in the saga, saying his dealings with Barilaro \u201cshowed poor judgment\u201d and were \u201cinappropriate\u201d.

The health minister, Mark Butler, will also announce on Monday that a second shipment of almost 40,000 vials of the monkeypox vaccine Jynneos has arrived in Australia and will be made available through the states and territories. More than 140 cases of monkeypox have been reported in Australia since May, including 69 in Victoria, 55 in New South Wales, seven in Western Australia and five in Queensland. Despite only one case being notified last month, health advocates are emphasising the need for vigilance.   Related: Can Australia contain the monkeypox outbreak?

Of these, 100,000 are due to be delivered by the end of this year and the remaining 350,000 will be rolled out next year. The first batch of vaccines arrived in August and nearly 25,000 people at the highest risk have received their first dose.

In an interview with Guardian Australia ahead of the budget on 29 March, the treasurer said he was conscious that a changing climate rendered insurance problematic in some parts of Australia. Frydenberg said the cleanup after catastrophic flooding in New South Wales and Queensland would be a focal point in his pre-election economic statement.

A raft of polls suggest Labor would win an election held today. The economic statement is expected to contain cash payments providing cost-of-living relief for low and middle income earners, as well as spending on security and defence and on local manufacturing and regional infrastructure, including new hydrogen proposals for the energy transition. With fuel prices soaring, and other consumer prices on the rise, the government faces political pressure to assist households given wages growth is persistently sluggish. The government favours short-term cash payments to help with rising petrol and grocery prices in order to avoid building structural spending into the budget bottom line. Asked whether the Reserve Bank of Australia could lift interest rates while Australia was on an election footing, Frydenberg said that was ultimately a decision for the central bank. But he said the RBA, based on its public commentary, would be monitoring inflation and employment and looking for signs of wages growth before increasing the official cash rate.

The budget will contain a $46.8m pre-employment program for people between the ages of 15 and 24. The government says the program will provide community-focused interventions including training and work experience. In another pre-budget announcement, the government has also earmarked about $75m in additional support for travel agents and tour providers, following pandemic-related disruptions. The tourism minister, Dan Tehan, said the targeted program would \u201csupport travel agents and tour arrangement service providers to meet ongoing costs of running outlets, continue to process rebookings and provide high-quality customer service to their customers\u201d.

The federal government last year pledged $6.5bn to fund an extra 80,000 home care packages to alleviate the huge unmet demand from Australia\u2019s ageing population, after the royal commission warned of \u201cunacceptable\u201d delays. The new packages, largely welcomed by the sector, are being progressively released over two years to mid-2023. But the actual delivery of services approved and funded by the government is being compromised by ongoing staffing shortages.   Related: I have looked after thousands of dying people in aged care. I\u2019ve seen and heard things you cannot imagine |  Juliane Samara    Aged and Community Services Australia, an industry peak group, says it has received anecdotal reports that staff shortages in home care are now so severe that services simply cannot be provided to some people entitled to care in their own home. \u201cAged care was already suffering a serious workforce shortage and low wages prior to the pandemic. Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,\u201d Acsa\u2019s chief executive, Paul Sadler, said. That accords with comments from the largest home care provider, myHomecare Group, who told Guardian Australia that the sector\u2019s \u201cabysmal\u201d turnover and staffing shortages were compromising less urgent services to home care recipients. The latest government data shows that, despite the new funding, the total number of home care providers has actually decreased in the past year, down 1.8%, or 17 providers.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning        The data also shows 68,429 people had been approved for a home care package but are still waiting for that package to be provided at the level they were approved for. That is a reduced, but still significant, number of people who are in need that are not receiving adequate home care services. ADA Australia, a Queensland-based advocacy service for older Australians, said it was receiving complaints about delays to the rollout of new home care packages and about the difficulty in attracting and retaining staff for providers. Chief executive Geoff Rowe said earning a living wage in home care was a much more complex proposal, given the nature of the work, which required multiple blocks of a small number of hours of care. \u201cPotentially in some areas, it\u2019s not as big a problem as others, but once you step out of large metropolitan areas, it becomes more and more complex,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat said, we are also hearing that within metropolitan areas that people are experiencing that same difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff.\u201d Ian Yates, head of the Council on the Ageing, said last week that, while the delivery of the government\u2019s promised 80,000 packages was on schedule, the ability to actually deliver servicesvaried across different regions. \u201cIt\u2019s patchy \u2026 Several months ago we were getting a lot of reports out of Queensland, that people couldn\u2019t find a provider, and regional areas is a challenge at the best of times,\u201d he said. Whichever party wins the next election must prioritise \u201cthe creation and training of an Australian workforce via real wage increases and training to assist people into aged care,\u201d Sadler said. \u201cRecent analysis from Australian Aged Care Collaboration shows too many in the aged care workforce are on the brink of the poverty line, with wages for aged care workers having failed to keep up with the cost of living.\u201d    Related: Home aged care staff at \u2018breaking point\u2019, as most miss out on Coalition\u2019s $800 bonus    A spokesperson for Richard Colbeck, the aged care minister, said the workforce had grown by 15,000 since the start of November and \u201ccontinues to increase\u201d. The government provided $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce in the last budget. \u201cWhile Labor has offered nothing on home care \u2013 the Morrison Government is investing in aged care workforce initiatives that attract and retain a diverse range of workers with the right skills, knowledge and attributes to work and pursue a career in aged care,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cInitiatives include place-based approaches targeting local workers and national projects.\u201d The spokesperson also said the decrease of providers overall, reflected in the latest data on home care, was due to the strategic acquisition of providers under the umbrella of larger organisations. \u201cImportantly, [the] latest quarterly Home Care Program (HCP) data reveals the number of providers delivering care and services has actually increased from 820 (31 December 2020) to 844 (31 December 2021),\u201d the spokesperson said.  Sadler said the industry would be working on a home care workforce recruitment, training and retention program with the federal government. \u201cA credible workforce plan from government also needs to ensure people remain working in home care have an ongoing commitment to fair pay and conditions, training and skills development and opportunity for career progression,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, in residential care, workers across five providers have voted to take industrial action, raising the prospect of strikes during the election campaign. The United Workers Union said on Tuesday that the providers collectively employed 7,000 workers who had voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action. Three more ballots are due in the next week. \u201cThey are sick of propping up a broken system,\u201d UWU aged care director Carolyn Smith said. \u201cThey are sick of their hard work not quite making up for the chronic understaffing in the system, so they are physically and emotionally exhausted by never really giving the quality of care that they know the people they are looking after deserve.\u201d", "Calls for GP funding boost as figures reveal how Medicare gap hits some of Australia\u2019s poorest areas [2022-04-21T17:30:01Z]": "Health experts are pleading with both sides of politics to commit to increased funding for GPs after figures reveal lower-income areas are among those most disadvantaged by the Medicare gap. \nIn the face of doctor shortages and rising patient fees, new data reveals some of the most disadvantaged electorates have among the highest average out-of-pocket costs for a consultation. \nMedicare funds a rebate of $39.10 for a standard consultation, however aside from indexation rises, this amount has been frozen since 2013, with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) warning that a disconnect between the rebate and real cost of delivering services is forcing GPs to either increase out-of-pocket costs for patients or, increasingly, shut down entirely. \n \n  Related: Anne Ruston defends past comments that Medicare \u2018is not sustainable\u2019 after PM names her as health minister if re-elected  \n \nMoreover, the RACGP and other industry experts are concerned that unless the government overhauls how GPs are funded, increasing numbers of medical graduates will opt for a career in higher earning specialties, which in turn would worsen health outcomes for lower income earners who could not afford rising out-of-pocket costs. \nCommonwealth data broken down by electorate shows that the average out-of-pocket costs for a GP consult range from $27.11, in the South Australian seat of Spence, to $52.05 in Wentworth, home to some of Sydney\u2019s wealthiest suburbs in the city\u2019s east. \nSeveral inner city and suburban seats such as Melbourne\u2019s Higgins and Macnamara \u2013 third and fourth most expensive at $50.65 and $50.29 \u2013 as well as Sydney \u2013 the fifth most expensive at $49.55 \u2013 also feature as some of the most expensive electorates for out-of-pocket costs. \nHowever, out-of-pocket costs in the Northern Territory are among the most expensive in the country, with Solomon \u2013 the electorate that is home to Darwin \u2013 recording the second highest average out-of-pocket costs in Australia, at $50.78, while Lingiari, which takes in the remainder of the territory, is the 14th most expensive, at $45.61. \nBoth Solomon and Lingiari are marginal seats, held by Labor at 3.1% and 5.5% respectively. \nThe marginal north-western Sydney seat of Greenway, which Labor MP Michelle Rowland holds by 2.8%, has the 20th highest average out-of-pocket cost for a GP visit, at $45.17, while in Queensland, the seat of Groom, which takes in Toowoomba, ranks 18th highest, with an average cost of $45.36. \n Interactive \n \nRising GP fees \nDr Karen Price, the RACGP president, wants the Coalition and Labor to commit to better funding GPs in line with the rising costs, and is keen for voters to understand the associated impact on health outcomes for Australians. \nShe said it was proven \u201ctime and time again\u201d that investments in primary care lead to a greater saving for the government in hospital costs, by treating before conditions escalate. \nPrice acknowledged a government figure that about 89% of GP services were bulk-billed \u2013 but said this did not mean that 89% of patients were not paying for their doctor visits, rather, that a visit that included a consult and having something removed registers as two services. \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \n\u201cWe think the number of Australians who don\u2019t pay anything for their GP visits is between 67% and 70%.\u201d \nPrice was alarmed at some of the higher average out-of-pocket costs in poorer areas. \u201cIf you\u2019re in an area where there\u2019s no other doctor and you\u2019ve got a six-week wait for a bulk-billed appointment, they can charge more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the vulnerable people in those electorates are not going to access it. \n\u201cMost of the healthcare people need is related to their postcode and their socio-economic status. It\u2019s often those who need the most care that are least able to pay for it.\u201d \nRising cost of business \nPrice said higher out-of-pocket costs in regional areas came at a time when it was tough to attract GPs trained in cities to relocate for work. Even in cities, Price said, current Medicare funding levels were turning graduates away from general practice. \n\u201cWe know that only 15% of medical graduates are looking to enter general practice, which is down from 50%. When you\u2019ve got kids and Hecs debt after a long course, it can be more attractive to stay in a hospital job with leave and other entitlements, rather than become a GP.\u201d \nPrice noted that the Australian Medical Association recommends GPs charge $86 for a standard consult, and that if they don\u2019t charge this, \u201cthey\u2019re basically discounting their work\u201d. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nPrice said she had observed a recent spike in practices moving away from being entirely bulk-billed, and others being forced to close down, and believed this was in part because Medicare funding was outdated. \n\u201cOur healthcare has become more complex. We have an ageing population, and mental health and complex chronic conditions are more common. They require consultations but are not valued by Medicare in the same way. You\u2019ll earn more if you see three patients in the time it takes for an extended appointment for one patient,\u201d Price said. \nAdditionally, Price pointed to the increased cost of paying staff, acquiring and maintaining new computers and technologies used to treat patients, and the price of PPE that soared during the pandemic, as reasons why some GPs were forced to increase their out-of-pocket costs. \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nDr Stephen Duckett, a Grattan Institute health economist and former secretary of what is now the Department of Health, echoed Price\u2019s concerns that general practice was underfunded and graduates were turning away from the career, but said \u201cthe right answer may not be by increasing the rebate\u201d. \n\u201cWe want to reshape the way primary medical care works \u2026 so exploring funding that increases the incentive for continuity, to reward GPs for building a relationship with patients, which can allow them to be more proactive in their care with things such as phone checkups. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to invest more money in general practice. And we can\u2019t ignore that if you\u2019re leaving medical school today, the choice between being a GP and a cardiologist is five times as much money, so we have to start addressing that,\u201d Duckett said. \nWhat the political parties say \nThe opposition health spokesperson, Mark Butler, did not directly answer if Labor would increase the Medicare rebate, but said \u201cLabor will always strengthen and protect Medicare, we\u2019ll have more to say during the campaign\u201d. \n\u201cUnder Scott Morrison it\u2019s never been harder or more expensive to see a GP. \n \n  Related: Campaign catchup: Are we in for a repeat of Mediscare?  \n \n\u201cWe know that when people can\u2019t afford to see the GP they either end up in overwhelmed emergency departments or just put off getting the healthcare they need,\u201d Butler said, also pointing out Labor\u2019s urgent care clinic commitment. \nGuardian Australia asked Greg Hunt, the outgoing health minister, if the Morrison government planned to increase the Medicare rebate. \nA spokesperson did not answer directly, but referred Guardian Australia to the figure that 89% of GP services are bulk-billed, and said that \u201cthe Morrison government is committed to not just supporting GPs, but also supporting their patients\u201d. \n\u201cIn terms of funding, Medicare was $19bn under Labor and is $31bn this year growing to almost $36bn over the forward estimates,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "NT reinstates alcohol bans in effort to curb crime surge in Alice Springs [2023-02-06T08:03:29Z]": "Alcohol bans are set to be reintroduced in central Australia after a snap review recommended tighter restrictions to address a surge of crime and antisocial behaviour in Alice Springs.

She said the federal government has also agreed to $250m in additional funding for central Australia for a raft of measures, including youth engagement programs, job creation, improved services and support for on country learning. The alcohol bans were recommended in a snap review commissioned in the wake of rising crime in Alice Springs. Local health organisations attributed the spike in crime to the easing of interventionist-era alcohol restrictions which came to an end in July, meaning liquor became legal in some communities for the first time in 15 years. In her report last week to the NT chief minister and prime minister, newly appointed central Australia regional controller, Dorrelle Anderson, a Luritja woman, recommended law changes to ensure remote communities and town camps remain dry, to address the underlying causes of disadvantage and crime and to ensure needs-based funding for services and organisations.

It is about a lack of employment services, a lack of community services, a lack of educational opportunity,\u201d he said. Last month fresh alcohol restrictions were imposed on Alice Springs, banning residents from buying takeaway alcohol on Monday and Tuesday and restricting takeaway alcohol sales on the other days, prompting concerns of a return to intervention-era policies. But Fyles said the new rules announced Monday are a way to move away from \u201crace-based alcohol policies\u201d and denied the new restrictions were a return to those policies under the intervention. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Stronger Futures. This is territory-based legislation. I\u2019ve always said we need to be agile in this space and we\u2019re trying to find that balance between respecting local community voice,\u201d Fyles said Monday. Fyles said the vast majority of remote Aboriginal communities are already dry and told reporters the measures already in place in Alice Springs are having an immediate impact with reduced pressure on police and authorities. \u201cWe need that to continue. We\u2019re seeing benefit from those short-term restrictions,\u201d she said. Fyles also stressed that addressing the underlying reasons behind crime, family and domestic violence and problem drinking was vital, adding that the Territory government is \u201clistening\u201d to communities about the best way forward and collaborating with all tiers of governments. Fyles said the $250m in funding would mean better service provision in remote communities surrounding Alice Springs, alleviating some of the pressure on the town. \u201cThis funding will focus on improved community safety and cohesion through more youth engagement and diversion programs.

In 2022 there were 756 suicides in Victoria, a 9% increase compared with 2021, according to data published by the coroner\u2019s court on Monday which reveals much of the increase occurred in the latter part of the year.   Related: Younger girls increasingly presenting to Australian hospitals in mental distress    From January to July the monthly number of suicides in Victoria was consistent with previous years, at approximately 58 suicides a month. From August to December, the monthly number of suicides increased to an average of 65 a month. In a statement, the court said it \u201cconsiders that the higher numbers during August to December 2022 might signal an emerging trend\u201d. The most substantial increase in suicides was seen in the 65 years and older cohort, with a 32% rise from 2021 to 2022. There was a 21% increase among people aged 45 to 54.

In January, two Australian studies published in the Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry revealed alarming levels of mental illness among teenage girls in particular, who are least likely to be admitted to hospital when seeking treatment. The Victorian state coroner, John Cain, said it was \u201ctroubling to see an increase in suicides emerge in the last few months of 2022\u201d. \u201cIt is not clear what is driving this increase \u2013 especially amongst those 65 and over \u2013 but we are monitoring closely to see if this trend continues,\u201d he said. The head of suicide prevention research at the University of New South Wales-affiliated Black Dog Institute, Associate Prof Fiona Shand, said the data \u201cis consistent with what we\u2019re seeing in other jurisdictions\u201d. The most recent New South Wales data shows 885 suspected or confirmed suicide deaths reported in from 1 January to 30 November 2022, compared with 818 over the same period the year prior. \u201cWhile the Victorian coroner has indicated we can\u2019t be sure of what is driving the trend just yet \u2026 we really need to be looking at some key areas in terms of suicide prevention,\u201d Shand said. \u201cAccess to affordable and high quality mental health care is something that\u2019s really suffered over many years, and we saw the health system really show us those gaps during the pandemic. That\u2019s getting worse. When they manage to receive care, people are getting it too late.\u201d It is crucial that governments respond to social and economic stressors, she added. Suicide rates dropped during the early years of pandemic because of social supports such as jobseeker and jobkeeper which helped ease living pressures, she said. \u201cBut people are now facing layer upon layer upon layer of difficulty over the last three or four years, having been hit by the longer term pandemic impacts, financial stressors including increasing interest rates and high cost of living,\u201d Shand said. \u201cAnd we know that those things do have an impact on suicide rates.\u201d In its submission last month to the Senate\u2019s cost of living inquiry, Suicide Prevention Australia wrote that it is \u201cdeeply concerned about the growing number of Australian families and households struggling with the rising cost of living\u201d.

Farrell, who was in Canberra for the resumption of parliament, met virtually with his counterpart, Wang Wentao, for about 90 minutes on Monday. While the meeting did not produce a breakthrough, Farrell said the talks were \u201canother important step in the stabilisation of Australia\u2019s relations with China\u201d and he identified climate change as an area for closer cooperation. \u201cI accepted an invitation from Minister Wang to travel to Beijing in the near future to continue our productive dialogue,\u201d Farrell said in a statement after the meeting. It will be the first visit to China by an Australian trade minister since Simon Birmingham\u2019s trip to Shanghai in November 2019. Farrell\u2019s visit follows the trip by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, in December 2022. The Australians used Monday\u2019s meeting to push for the removal of China\u2019s tariffs and bans on key export sectors.  \u201cOur discussion covered a range of trade and investment issues, including the need for resumption of unimpeded trade for Australian exporters so that Chinese consumers can continue to benefit from high quality Australian products,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cMinister Wang and I agreed to enhance dialogue at all levels, including between officials, as a pathway towards the timely and full resumption of trade.\u201d   Related: Australia\u2019s diplomatic influence in Asia on the rise as ALP advances interests abroad    At the height of diplomatic tensions between China and Australia in 2020, Beijing blocked phone calls and meetings between Australian government ministers and their direct counterparts as a result of the then-Morrison government\u2019s early push for a Covid origins inquiry.

Farrell, however, received a congratulatory letter from Wang shortly after being appointed as trade minister last year and responded to that correspondence. Farrell has continued to push Australia\u2019s largest trading partner to remove the trade \u201cblockages\u201d, arguing it would be in both countries\u2019 interests to do so. At the beginning of the meeting, Farrell told Wang the trade blockages in recent years had been \u201cto the detriment of both countries\u201d. Wang replied that he was \u201cvery happy to have this virtual meeting with you\u201d and was \u201clooking forward to meeting with you in person at the earliest time\u201d. Wang said the two sides needed to \u201cwork together to bring more positive factors\u201d into the economic relationship, but cautioned that \u201cthis meeting cannot resolve all of these issues\u201d. He argued the initial emphasis should be on building mutual trust. \u201cI would like to work together with you to bring our economic cooperation back to the correct track,\u201d Wang said.

Let\u2019s change the curriculum first to address widespread ignorance of Australia\u2019s history | Matthew Bach    Previous AWM leaders have cited the memorial\u2019s governing legislation, the Australian War Memorial Act, as preventing it from covering the frontier wars, and have said its mission \u201cdoes not extend beyond the experience of deployed Australian forces overseas in war and in peace\u201d. But Beazley, appointed chair a month ago, told the ABC on Monday that he saw no such limitation and wanted a \u201cproper recognition of the frontier conflict\u201d as part of the institution\u2019s controversial $500m expansion. \u201cWe do have to have a proper recognition of the frontier conflict, now how we do that is not yet settled because the curating committee will not be formed until next year,\u201d he said.

But the memorial council quickly appeared to pour cold water on Nelson\u2019s comments, telling News Corp it would not create a major permanent feature and that its focus on colonial wars would only be \u201cmodest\u201d. Nelson\u2019s comments also prompted an immediate backlash from the Returned Services League and the shadow veterans\u2019 affairs spokesperson, Barnaby Joyce, who said the Coalition \u201copposed any move that could put the Australian War Memorial at the centre of partisan political debate\u201d. Asked about the opposition to a more substantial recognition of the frontier wars, Beazley said: \u201cHow can we have a history of Australian wars without that? It\u2019s a simple question, because we long since abandoned the idea that the memorial only depicted events from world war one onwards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do that \u2013 which we have, comprehensively moved away from that \u2013 you have to have frontier wars reflected in it because it is by that means we established ourselves.\u201d Beazley also suggested that the memorial had new legal advice about the restrictions in the AWM Act, previously cited as a reason for its failure to properly commemorate the conflict. \u201cThere was a legal interpretation at one point of time that said that and then more recently we\u2019ve had legal representations that within the broader mandate you can do it,\u201d he said Beazley said the memorial\u2019s commemoration could not be the only one of its type. He said there must be depictions \u201cin every museum, in all the state museums, and the Australian Museum\u201d. \u201cWe have to be prepared as we go through truth telling processes to consult with different Aboriginal nations as to how they want massacres reflected, commemorated,\u201d he said. According to conservative estimates, the frontier wars caused the deaths of at least 20,000 Indigenous Australians at the hands of Australian-based military regiments, police forces and settlers\u2019 militia from 1788 to 1928.

The research, published by the University of Melbourne and Orygen in January, followed a 2021 Victorian coroner\u2019s report that found 47 international student suicides had occurred in the state in the decade to 2019.

McKay said culturally adapted services, improved risk screening and collaborative mental health services providing culturally sensitive care were needed to address the gap. An Orygen report released in 2020 found despite experiencing an increased risk for poor mental health, international students underutilised available support services. \u201cServices aren\u2019t adapted to international students,\u201d McKay said. \u201cWhen they walk in they might not find it\u2019s a safe space or comfortable to them.

A secretive hearing is due to begin on Monday to decide Hollingworth\u2019s fate in the church, more than five years after complaints were first made through the Melbourne diocese\u2019s complaints system, Kooyoora. The protracted process, initiated by complaints in 2018, has now taken longer than the entire child abuse royal commission, which held 8,013 private sessions and made 2,575 referrals to authorities in the same time. The royal commission found that in 1993, when Hollingworth was archbishop of Brisbane, a lay preacher, John Linton Elliot, admitted to him that he had abused two boys. Hollingworth talked to one of the survivors, BYB, who told him that \u201cElliot was a paedophile and Elliot had abused him over a number of years\u201d, the royal commission found. Hollingworth then sought the opinion of a psychiatrist, John Slaughter, who \u201cformed an opinion that Elliot was a paedophile and that his personality type was untreatable\u201d, according to the royal commission. \u201cWe are satisfied that the information Dr Slaughter conveyed to Dr Hollingworth in around September 1993 was sufficient to alert him that Elliot posed an ongoing risk to children,\u201d the royal commission found.   Related:  Victorian government to apologise to victims of sexual abuse at state schools later this year    Despite this, Hollingworth permitted Elliot to continue in his role as rector of Dalby until he retired five years later. The royal commission described it as a \u201cserious error of judgment\u201d and Hollingworth has apologised for his handling of the matter. Hollingworth was the Anglican archbishop of Brisbane for 11 years from 1989 and served as governor general from 2001 to 2003. He resigned from the office after his handling of sexual abuse allegations prompted repeated criticism, including over his comments about a survivor, Beth Heinrich. A royal commission analysis of abuse complaints in the 23 Anglican dioceses from 1980 to the end of 2015 showed the Brisbane diocese had by far the highest, recording 33% of all complaints, and a total of 371. Adelaide, the diocese with the next highest complaint numbers, received fewer than half that number. After the end of the royal commission five years ago, complaints were lodged about Hollingworth through the Anglican complaints process, Kooyoora. The complaints have progressed through a complicated, multi-step process, which included investigation by Vincent Lucas, Kooyoora\u2019s then director of professional standards. The ABC reported that Lucas had told a survivor in 2018 that there was \u201cmore than enough justification to prove [Hollingworth\u2019s] unfitness to hold Holy Orders\u201d. The matter has not finalised in the five years since and is now before a professional standards tribunal, which is conducted behind closed doors and is otherwise cloaked in secrecy. Guardian Australia understands the tribunal was first meant to hear the matter in December 2021. The repeated delays to the hearing were first reported in the Australian.

Related: I agreed to my sperm donor\u2019s anonymity - now I see my daughter has a right to know who she is | Dorothy Byrne    Donors and recipients post introductions on the site. They might describe what they look like, how old they are, say where they\u2019re from, whether they\u2019re interested in co-parenting, and sometimes if they prefer artificial insemination (AI) or natural insemination (NI), meaning sex. Rebecca Kerner, the Australian and New Zealand Infertility Counsellors Association chair, says the waiting lists for sperm donors vary between clinics but can be up to two years. The pandemic worsened the pre-existing sperm shortage. For some women the need to find a donor can become urgent \u2013 and so they turn to the unregulated world of online sperm donations. The dangers of unregulated sperm Kerner is just one of a range of fertility experts who are warning women of the health and legal risks of informal donations. Thousands of Australians have joined social media groups that set donors up with recipients to avoid expensive, complicated clinical processes. Experts say going through a clinic means rigorous testing processes, counselling procedures and legal protections. But in the unregulated world, sperm could carry infectious or genetic diseases or be of very low quality. Without legal protections, donors could claim parenthood of the child, or have the obligations of parenthood unwillingly thrust upon them. Another issue is donors having unlimited children, who may unwittingly end up in incestuous relationships with their unknown half-siblings. Having so many siblings could also be traumatic for the donor-conceived child \u2013 if they find out. Yet another concern is that, while many choose AI, others prefer NI. There have been cases of a potential recipient meeting a donor, only to have them allegedly push for the sex option. Kerner says women needed to be \u201cempowered and fully informed\u201d about their decisions in a space full of \u201cmany mistruths\u201d.

Donors were also at risk of being the unwilling legal father of a child, she says. Informal donors are able to breach the caps in place across the country to limit the number of donor siblings (where they exist, they limit the number of births to five or 10 families) and the possibility of incest between them. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have is laws keeping up to date,\u201d Kerner says. It\u2019s impossible to pin down the \u201csperm shortage\u201d to a particular number, because there is no central register, and clinics may source sperm from a combination of overseas sperm banks, local donors and donors who are known to the recipient. Kerner says while she\u2019s heard of two-year waiting times, it varies immensely. City Fertility Group, which has clinics across the country, says there is no shortage of \u201cdonated, registered and genetically tested sperm\u201d. Its chief executive, Adnan Catakovic, says the donation is free but there is a cost of about $1,000 to cover testing, registration, storage, transport, counselling and other expenses.

There are clinics that say they have no waiting list, although there is always a delay for testing and counselling. \u2018There\u2019s obviously something not working\u2019 Online unregulated donation sites offer not just a chance to meet a donor, but artificial insemination kits, vitamins and supplements, and even accommodation bookings. The Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority chief executive, Anna MacLeod, says regulated IVF clinics protect the recipient, the donor and the child.  \u201cPeople who donate sperm through clinics are screened for infectious diseases such as HIV, which can be passed on to a woman and her baby,\u201d she says. \u201cThey also complete genetic health questionnaires which may offer useful information to a woman and her child further down the track. \u201cAnother risk is that those who donate sperm through informal arrangements could claim to be parent of a child born, which could give rise to access or shared custody entitlements. And finally, there is a risk that a donor may not provide their true details.\u201d   Related: \u2018I discovered I have dozens, probably hundreds, of siblings\u2019: Chrysta Bilton\u2019s extraordinary family story    Donor Conceived Australia says the lack of regulation in the online industry \u201cincreases risks to the parent and child\u201d. \u201cThey don\u2019t undergo the same stringent genetic and psychological screening as well as some donors only offering natural insemination to intended mothers,\u201d DCA says.

While China\u2019s military is still not as powerful as the US military, it has cut the American lead on this measure from 27 points in 2018 to 23 points in 2022.

The Central Australian Frack Free Alliance (Caffa) is asking the NT supreme court to review the process that led to the approval of Tamboran\u2019s environmental management plan, arguing the environment minister, Lauren Moss, failed to properly consider the environmental impacts of the project.   Related: Beetaloo Basin holds \u2018Australia\u2019s greatest emissions reduction opportunity\u2019, inquiry hears    In particular, Caffa will argue the minister failed to fully consider the climate consequences of the project, including the climate effects of future production in the Beetaloo that the exploration may facilitate. The approval allows Tamboran to drill and frack 12 exploratory wells 600km south of Darwin. Caffa\u2019s case is a test of the NT\u2019s petroleum regulations which were reformed in 2016. The group, represented by the Environmental Defenders Office, will argue those reforms provided for a wider assessment of the risks associated with gas or fracking activity. \u201cBy approving this exploration application, the minister is laying the grounds for potentially thousands of fracking wells to be drilled in the NT,\u201d Caffa\u2019s spokesperson, Hannah Ekin, said. \u201cTamboran\u2019s project would help facilitate the drilling of vast new gas fields across the heart of the territory.

It\u2019s not based on any sound principle of economics, finance or even politics. It\u2019s purely driven by the prime minister\u2019s need for a regular flow of \u201cannounceables\u201d. \nWhile the prime minister is in Lismore on Wednesday to declare a national emergency and announce flood funding, Australians \u2013 and in particular disaster-stricken communities \u2013 are growing tired of his \u201cannounce early, announce often\u201d modus operandi. \nScott Morrison\u2019s latest problem is that his rhetorical support for small government has crashed into the climate-changed reality of what communities like Lismore need in the days after their unprecedented floods, and what those in places like Bega are still waiting for years after their unprecedented bushfires.  \n \n  Related: The PM calls this a natural disaster \u2013 it\u2019s not natural, it\u2019s climate change smashing down our doors | Eddie Lloyd  \n \nAustralia is one of the richest countries in the world, but while there\u2019s no shortage of money to fund the $16bn-a-year stage three tax cuts for our highest-income earners, when it comes to helping families and businesses recover from the complete devastation of record floods and fires, apparently we need to hasten slowly. Rather than rushing jobkeeper money out the door the way they did to help the likes of Harvey Norman, when it comes to climate-induced disasters it seems the Coalition thinks we need to save for a rainy day. \nThe problem is that it\u2019s already pouring. Like the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the IPCC and the Australian insurance industry, the Morrison government knows that cyclones, storms, floods and fires have already become more common, more intense and more expensive. That\u2019s why they announced a $10bn insurance fund to help subsidise the cost of insurance in politically powerful far-north Queensland. \nThe National party may house most of the climate sceptics in the federal parliament, but it doesn\u2019t stop them demanding public cash to help their constituents deal with climate impacts. \nThere is no economic reason the Australian government needs to \u201csave up\u201d billions of dollars in a disaster relief fund. Even if it had wanted to prepare, the time to start saving was back when John Howard was prime minister. If the Coalition knew the disasters were coming (which they did) and thought balancing the budget was important (which they do) then they should have started scrapping fossil fuel subsidies and stockpiling our pennies in their \u201cspecial funds\u201d decades ago. But now, like firefighters trying to save water during a bushfire, we have a government telling people who are still homeless after the 2020 bushfires to keep waiting. \n Interactive \n \nThings are only going to get worse. Climate change isn\u2019t caused by accident, it takes decades of careful planning and more than $10bn a year in Australian fossil fuel subsidies. \nWhile a carbon price raised a lot of money and reduced a lot of emissions, such economic orthodoxy remains too radical for Australian debate. However, removing the billions of dollars Australia spends on oil, gas and coal subsidies would provide a big price signal and an enormous flow of annual revenue needed for a genuine climate adaptation fund.

Qatar, the second biggest exporter of LNG behind Australia, collects 20 times as much tax from their gas exports than we do ours. Australia Institute research estimated that a measly $1 a tonne levy on the carbon dioxide embodied in our fossil fuel exports would raise over $1.5bn a year. \nAlthough the Coalition\u2019s subsidies largesse wasn\u2019t enough to drive a \u201cgas-led recovery\u201d, Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine has certainly filled gas industry coffers. The people of Ukraine and Russia bear the cost of war and sanctions.

A windfall gains tax on the Australian gas industry is yet another source of revenue that a government that belatedly wants to \u201cstockpile emergency relief funds\u201d could tap. But it won\u2019t. \nJust as there is no shortage of money for car parks and income tax cuts, there is no actual shortage of money to help those who have lost everything in recent bushfires or floods. \nWho we elect determines what problems we solve. The Coalition has made it clear it believes the \u201cburden\u201d of income tax on those earning over $200,000 a year is more pressing than the burden of whole communities being destroyed. Likewise, it believes that subsidies to prop up the fossil fuel industry are more pressing than subsidies for renewables or climate adaptation.

The federal government is consulting on legislation to establish a scheme to incentivise investment in nature restoration by creating tradable certificates for projects that protect and restore biodiversity. An exposure draft, published shortly before Christmas, is similarly worded to legislation proposed by the previous government and would establish governance arrangements for the scheme. It follows a speech by the environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, last year in which she said she hoped Australia may one day be home to a \u201cgreen Wall Street\u201d that attracted conservation investment from around the world.   Related: Albanese outlines plan for nature restoration market prompting calls for more urgent action    Andrew Macintosh, an Australian National University professor and former head of the government\u2019s emissions reduction assurance committee, said although a nature repair market presented opportunities, there were several issues that could \u201cimpede the realisation of its potential\u201d. \u201cMost obvious is the absence of a source of demand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is expecting the private sector to be the main buyer but the private sector is not yet there, at least not at scale. \u201cIf this market is going to work, governments need to be the primary buyer for the foreseeable future.\u201d Macintosh also said there were governance issues in the draft that could create similar problems to those seen in the carbon offset market.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Megan Evans, a senior lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, said one concern was the draft only required the environment minister to \u201chave regard\u201d to integrity standards when making a method under the legislation, rather than making the endorsement of methods contingent on compliance with integrity standards. Evans said she also disagreed with government\u2019s proposal to have the Clean Energy Regulator administer the scheme. She said the environment protection agency, when established, would be better placed to do this work. The former government proposed a land stewardship scheme that would reward farmers who restored and protected nature on their properties. The Albanese government\u2019s proposal expands the proposal to all landholders and would apply to terrestrial as well as coastal and marine areas. Plibersek has put private investment at the centre of the government\u2019s plans for the environment, which include a zero-extinctions target and a commitment to protect 30% of Australia\u2019s land and sea areas by 2030. But Evans agreed with Macintosh that the private market demand for certificates was \u201cuntested and likely overestimated\u201d. \u201c[The government] haven\u2019t committed any money to kickstart this market so it\u2019s very likely it will be a thin, low-activity market,\u201d she said. Tim Beshara, manager of policy and strategy of the Wilderness Society, was critical that the government\u2019s first proposal for new biodiversity legislation was \u201cnear word-for-word identical\u201d to the land stewardship bill put forward by David Littleproud, the former government\u2019s agriculture minister. He said the proposal was an attempt to financialise Australia\u2019s nature and outsource its repair to the corporate sector. Beshara said he was concerned the most likely outcome was the market would become a biodiversity offset market that was by driven by nature destruction elsewhere. \u201cThe government has clearly indicated that while this is not its intention, if regulators choose to use this scheme as part of offset requirements, then that is OK by government,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat follows from that is that the only way the market would grow is if the amount of destruction also grows.\u201d An audit of the NSW biodiversity market, which functions as an offset scheme, found that scheme had serious performance and integrity concerns. The Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the party would review the legislation carefully but said it was \u201cdelusional\u201d to suggest the market would repair Australia\u2019s biodiversity crisis while habitat clearing continued.   Related: \u2018Our fate rests on efforts like this\u2019: the family restoring precious rainforest to its former glory    Plibersek said once the market was properly structured and running: \u201cI\u2019m confident we will see increasing investment in nature repair.\u201d She noted a report by the consulting firm PwC had estimated a nature restoration market could inject $137bn into conservation measures by 2050. \u201cBusinesses tell me all the time that they want to invest in nature because their shareholders, customers and staff are demanding it,\u201d she said. \u201cGlobal changes to accounting rules make it inevitable that businesses will start reporting on their nature-related risks. There will be an increasing public expectation that businesses act to reduce those risks.\u201d Plibersek said all feedback on the exposure draft would be considered before legislation was introduced to parliament this year.", "Morning mail: \u2018damning\u2019 environment report, China\u2019s missile interception test, the story behind cult hit Grimmish [2022-06-20T20:57:42Z]": "Good morning.

There are 745 scams reported every day to Scamwatch \u2013 but it\u2019s estimated these are just the tip of the iceberg, as many go undisclosed. Here are five of the most common scams going around at the moment, and what to watch out for: 1. The \u2018hi mum\u2019 scam The \u2018hi mum\u2019 scam is simple and effective. Victims are contacted by an unknown number \u2013 mostly through text or WhatsApp \u2013 and told their loved one has lost or damaged their phone. The scammer then asks for money to help them replace the phone.   Related: Australian banks should reimburse scam victims, ACCC and consumer advocates say    The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission said it was seeing a new style of these scams where a text message \u2013 apparently from \u2018Mum\u2019 or \u2018Dad\u2019 \u2013 asks receivers to send money to them. The text message usually says the person is at Woolworths, Coles or a service station but has taken the wrong card with them. The message then asks the receiver to put $150 and $400 into their account and says they will \u201cpay you back when I get home\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cConsumers who receive messages from a number they don\u2019t recognise should independently verify the contact by reaching out to the person the messenger is purporting to be,\u201d an ACCC spokesperson said. 2. The toll road scam In this text-based scam, victims are sent a message from a toll road company, such as Linkt, saying they have overdue fines. Dr Khandakar Ahmed, senior lecturer in IT at Victoria University, said this scam was targeted at people who don\u2019t travel regularly, often over the holiday period. \u201cScammers use the holiday period to target irregular travellers,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cStatistically if you send 10,000 people such a message, 10% will have travelled through a toll way recently and they won\u2019t have an account linked to their car.\u201d The victims are then prompted to click on the link to pay their fine or update the details. They are taken to an official-looking website where they enter their bank details. Ahmed said toll companies would never text asking for money or personal details. If you do have an unpaid toll fine, it will come in the mail. 3. Online job scams Dan Halpin, the chief executive of Cybertrace, a private cyber-investigations firm, said they were seeing an increase in the number of online job scams. These are often conducted via messaging platforms including WhatsApp and social media, with victims contacted by someone pretending to be a recruitment officer with a good job offer. Targets are often asked to set up a cryptocurrency wallet, converting their own money on the promise they will make more back. \u201cThe scammers are smooth talkers and will be very convincing if asked why the cryptocurrency is necessary for the position,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I can assure you, there is no legitimate reason why a job applicant would need to own a cryptocurrency wallet and convert their money to cryptocurrency.\u201d If the advertisement is listed on social media, particularly on a group or community page, or sent directly via a messaging platform, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a scam, according to Halpin. 4. Suspicious transaction scams In suspicious transactions, scam targets are called by someone pretending to be from their bank. The person tells them there has been a suspicious transaction on their account, or a transfer has gone through that shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cThey can also send different messages telling you that your account is blocked, and asking you to contact them to unblock the account,\u201d Ahmed said. The victim is then asked to \u201cconfirm\u201d their details and hand over personal information. Ahmed said banks will never call and ask you to hand over personal information. If someone does, hang up and call your own bank via the phone number listed on their website. 5. Crypto scams   Related: How to not get caught in the million dollars a day of scams in Australia    Investment scams continue to be a honey pot for fraudsters. They\u2019re exceptionally sophisticated and often run by experienced criminal syndicates. \u201cThe most common type of crypto scam encourages individuals to invest with the assistance of a crypto broker or trader via their website,\u201d Halpin said. \u201cThe crypto broker in turn trades the cryptocurrencies on behalf of the investor, and the investor can monitor the trading and in some instances even withdraw small amounts of money.\u201d The accounts are fake and scammers manipulate the data to make it look as though victims are trading on a legitimate platform. But in reality all that\u2019s happening is the scammer is stealing the victim\u2019s money. Halpin said the easiest way for potential investors to identify a crypto scam was by checking the broker\u2019s website via Cybertrace, using its custom-built scam detector, ScamSleuth. ", "Michaelia Cash denies knowing of alleged rape of Brittany Higgins 18 months before it became public [2022-10-17T01:49:11Z]": "Senator Michaelia Cash has denied that she knew of the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins more than a year before it became public in February 2021, agreeing it would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d to have covered it up. Cash was called to give evidence on Monday in the trial of Bruce Lehrmann, a former Coalition staffer accused of raping his colleague Higgins on the couch of their then boss, former defence industry minister Linda Reynolds, in Parliament House in March 2019. Lehrmann has has pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. Higgins\u2019 role was moved into the office of Cash, then skills minister, in the weeks following the alleged rape. Higgins has told the court she had multiple conversations with Cash about the alleged rape from October 2019, during her employment there.   Related: Brittany Higgins addresses accused rapist in court: \u2018Nothing was fine after what you did to me\u2019    But Cash said she first learned of the alleged rape almost 18 months later, in February 2021, when Higgins told her \u201cout of the blue\u201d prior to resigning. She said, in earlier conversations about the night, Higgins had told her only that she and another staffer had gotten drunk, come back to parliament, and that Higgins had fallen asleep in Reynolds\u2019 office.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Prosecutor Shane Drumgold SC put it to Cash she had multiple \u201crelatively detailed conversations\u201d with Higgins about the sexual aspects of her complaint from about October 2019, when Cash\u2019s office received an email from a journalist at the Canberra Times about the night. \u201cNot a sexual element, no,\u201d Cash said. \u201cThe first time that she mentioned a sexual element was I think in the conversation on the 5th of February 2021.\u201d Drumgold put it to Cash that the alleged rape of one staffer by another would have been \u201cpolitically embarrassing\u201d for the then government. \u201cI\u2019m putting to you that you\u2019re denying that because it would be politically embarrassing for you?\u201d Drumgold said. Cash replied: \u201cAbsolutely not. I just don\u2019t understand the line of questioning on political embarrassment. I don\u2019t know how it could be politically embarrassing.\u201d Cash said she simply did not \u201cunderstand a political connection to this\u201d. When asked if she understood what \u201cplausible deniability\u201d was, Cash said: \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re referring to, you\u2019d need to put it into context.\u201d Later, the defence barrister, Steven Whybrow, suggested to Cash that it would have been \u201cpolitical suicide to try and cover up a sexual assault between two staff\u201d. Cash responded: \u201cCorrect, hence my confusion with the line of questioning.\u201d Cash also said her office had offered full support to Higgins when it became aware of the allegations. Her chief of staff, Daniel Try, also gave evidence about his interactions with Higgins. He said he had met with Higgins following the Canberra Times\u2019 inquiry to Reynolds\u2019 office in October 2019. Try said that Higgins hadn\u2019t disclosed the alleged rape at that time. Try said he thought it was a security breach only, but recognised it was \u201csensitive\u201d so didn\u2019t continue asking her about it. Drumgold put it to Try that part of his role as chief of staff was to \u201cprotect against events that could have a negative political impact\u201d on a politician. \u201cWell, I suppose in a general sense, yes.\u201d Drumgold accused Try of learning of all the details of the allegation in October 2019, but then seeking to protect Cash after learning of the Canberra Times\u2019 inquiry. \u201cThat\u2019s not true at all, I was worried about Brittany,\u201d Try responded. The trial later heard from Samuel O\u2019Connor, a state politician in Queensland parliament, who was friends with Higgins in 2019. He said Higgins had disclosed the alleged rape to him in April 2019. \u201cI definitely remember her being concerned that this would define her, that she would be known for this instead of being good at her job,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. The trial continues before chief justice, Lucy McCallum, in the ACT supreme court.", "Guardian Essential poll: voters mark Morrison government down on flood response [2022-03-21T16:30:32Z]": "Voters are underwhelmed by the Morrison government\u2019s response to recent catastrophic flooding in New South Wales and Queensland, and a majority fear disasters will be worse in the absence of significant action to address climate risks, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey of 1,091 voters finds only 26% of respondents characterised the Coalition\u2019s recent flood disaster response as good, while 40% thought poor and 34% said neither good nor poor. The new data points to community disappointment but the public backlash after the flood disaster is less visceral than after the catastrophic summer bushfires of 2019-20. Back then, in January 2020, 57% of Guardian Essential respondents disapproved of Morrison\u2019s response while 32% approved. In the latest poll, a majority of respondents think the government needs to prepare for extreme weather events (65%). A majority also thinks if there isn\u2019t significant action on climate crisis policy soon, floods will be worse in the future (57% agreement).   Related: Australia as the 2022 election nears: is there a mood for change?    A majority also believes the government needs to replace coal with renewable energy alternatives (53%). But only 45% of respondents say the Morrison government contributed to the floods by not taking enough action to mitigate the risks of global heating. Voters were more concerned about a lack of climate action in January 2020. Back then, 65% of respondents thought bushfires would be worse if there wasn\u2019t substantial climate action soon and 60% of respondents pointed the finger directly at the Coalition for not doing enough. The Morrison government and the Perrottet government in NSW were criticised in the immediate aftermath of the floods for moving too slowly with rescue and recovery efforts. The federal government confirmed on Friday it would dip into its Emergency Response Fund to pay for flood mitigation measures in NSW and Queensland after months of escalating criticism from Labor about the Coalition\u2019s decision not to draw from the $4bn pool. Federal parliament will resume next week for a short session to allow the government to deliver the budget on 29 March. Morrison is expected to call the election within weeks. At the weekend, the Liberals in South Australia became the first incumbent government to lose an election since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the federal contest in sight, both the prime minister and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, are in full campaign mode. The latest Guardian Essential data suggests the gap is closing between Morrison and Albanese in the poll\u2019s preferred prime minister metric. Morrison is currently the preferred prime minister for 39% of respondents (down from 42% a fortnight ago) and Albanese by 36% (up from 34%). One-quarter of respondents aren\u2019t sure which candidate they prefer.   Related: Australians are ready for a change of government \u2013 but we can\u2019t watch the political contest as if it\u2019s a spectator sport | Peter Lewis    Comparing the result with previous election cycles, just before the 2010 election, Julia Gillard was ahead of Tony Abbott 47% to 35% with 18% undecided. In 2013, Abbott was ahead of Kevin Rudd 41% to 22% with 37% undecided. In 2016, Malcolm Turnbull was ahead of Bill Shorten 39% to 31% with 30% undecided while in 2019 Morrison was ahead of Shorten 39% to 32% with 28% undecided. Albanese is currently ahead of where Abbott, Rudd and Shorten were at the same point in the political cycle on this measure. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred \u201cplus\u201d, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. A fortnight ago, Labor\u2019s primary vote was on 35%, the Coalition on 36% and the Greens on 10%. The two-party preferred \u201cplus\u201d result had Labor on 49%, the Coalition on 44% and 7% of respondents undecided. In the latest poll, Labor\u2019s primary vote is 37% (up from 35%), Coalition: 37% (up from 36%), with 7% of respondents undecided. On the two-party preferred \u201cplus\u201d measure Labor is on 48% (down from 49%), the Coalition: 44% (steady), with 7% of respondents undecided. While Morrison was buffeted in the past fortnight by public criticism of the Coalition\u2019s flood response, Albanese has been trying to fend off internal backbiting about party culture that erupted after the sudden death of the Victorian right-wing senator Kimberley Kitching at the age of 52. Despite their recent challenges, in this fortnight\u2019s data, both leaders are up slightly on the poll\u2019s approval metric, with 45% of respondents (up from 44%) currently approving of Morrison\u2019s performance, 48% disapproving (down from 49%), with 7% of voters unsure.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   When it comes to Albanese, 43% of respondents approve of the opposition leader\u2019s performance (up from 42%), while 36% disapprove (down from 39%). While only 7% of respondents don\u2019t have a clear opinion about Morrison, the number of voters on the fence about Albanese remains significantly higher at 20% of respondents. All of these movements are inside the poll\u2019s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. On Tuesday, the Australian National University will also release the latest data on voting intention from a longitudinal survey of 3,472 voters. It finds that the Coalition\u2019s primary vote has slumped to 32.2% \u2013 a \u201cdramatic drop\u201d from 40.3% in January 2021 and 35.4% in January 2020. The lead author of the Centre for Social Research and Methods study, Prof Nicholas Biddle, said support for the Morrison government was \u201csignificantly lower than the 37% who said they would vote for Labor, who would appear to have been in an election-winning position\u201d. The proportion of undecided voters increased from 4.1% in January 2021 to 5.9% in January 2022, it found. According to the survey, women have a \u201crelative preference for Labor and the Greens compared with males\u201d who were \u201calso far more likely not know who they would vote for\u201d. The study did not estimate the two-party preferred vote \u201cdue to lack of information in our survey on preference flows\u201d but noted the result of primaries was consistent with public polling.", "Morning mail: Ukraine situation \u2018pretty dire\u2019, ABC funding boost, Neighbours need new friends [2022-02-06T19:56:16Z]": "Good morning.

Another six major fossil fuel projects were awaiting a decision. They include Whitehaven\u2019s proposed underground coalmine extension at Narrabri, which is the subject of public hearings this month. \n \n  Related: Australia considering more than 100 fossil fuel projects that could produce 5% of global industrial emissions  \n \nBased on documents submitted to the commission, ACF found emissions stemming from the approved projects \u2013 including those released on site (called scope one), from electricity used to run the operations (scope two) and the ultimate use of the coal and gas, often overseas (scope three) \u2013 would be about 3.2bn tonnes. That would reach 5bn tonnes if all currently proposed projects were approved. \nAnnual emissions within Australia are about 500m tonnes. Using a carbon budget approach \u2013 which calculates the remaining emissions possible to give the planet a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 ACF found the approvals in NSW since 2020 were equivalent to 1% of the global total. \nAnnica Schoo, the group\u2019s lead investigator and a former federal government compliance and policy officer, said this was a conservative assessment as some companies did not fully disclose their expected lifetime emissions, and estimates of the true heating impact of methane \u2013 a more powerful heat-trapping gas than carbon dioxide \u2013 had increased in recent years. \nSchoo said the planning commission was not acting on its duty to make decisions that served the interest of the NSW people. Most of the projects would result in thermal coal being mined into the 2030s and 2040s. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who witnessed the bushfires a couple of years ago would say that more carbon in the atmosphere is good for NSW,\u201d Schoo said. \u201cWhile UN climate framework rules mean Australia is not held accountable for some of these emissions because most of the coal and gas from these projects is burned elsewhere, Australia has a moral responsibility not to keep pushing climate-wrecking fuel on the world.\u201d \nThe NSW government referred questions to the planning and environment department. A department spokesperson said NSW was \u201cone of the first places anywhere in the world\u201d to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, and government modelling showed its renewable energy, electric vehicle and hydrogen policies were expected to trigger a 50% cut in state carbon pollution by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. \n\u201cThis places NSW as one of the top jurisdictions anywhere on the planet when it comes to emissions reduction commitments,\u201d they said. \n \n Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n  \n \nSchoo said a decision last year by the federal court that found the commonwealth environment minister had a duty of care to protect children from the climate crisis when exercising approval powers should be seen as a precedent for the state planning commission and other government decision makers. \nThe NSW approvals are consistent with other decisions to continue to approve and support fossil fuel projects across the country, although the federal government and both Coalition and Labor state governments have promised to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. \nWestern Australia supports significant gas developments off the state\u2019s north-west, and Queensland backs coal developments including in the Galilee basin, the site of Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine. Both have been supported by the federal government. \nThe Morrison government\u2019s position on fossil fuels is that cost and global markets will dictate the pace of the shift to cleaner technology. It has approved the expansion of four coalmines since September and in July granted a $175m loan for a new metallurgical coalmine in Queensland. On gas, it has said it hoped to develop four more basins after Beetaloo. \n  \n  \n   \n     \n    \n    Email:&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;daily morning and afternoon email newsletters\n    \n    \n    App:&nbsp;download our free app&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories\n    \n    \n    Social:&nbsp;follow us on YouTube,&nbsp;TikTok,&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;or&nbsp;Twitter\n    \n    \n    Podcast:&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;Apple Podcasts,&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nAustralia last year had more than 100 fossil fuel developments at various stages of development. An analysis found they could result in nearly 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, equivalent to about 5% of global industrial emissions, if all went ahead. \nA new analysis by the Australia Institute found the federal government had committed $749m to programs that supported fossil fuel industries since it set a national net zero emissions target for 2050 in October. Most of that money \u2013 $500m \u2013 was dedicated to a $1bn low emissions technology commercialisation fund and to supporting \u201cclean\u201d hydrogen, which includes hydrogen made from gas and coal as well as renewable energy. \nRichie Merzian, the Australia Institute\u2019s climate and energy program director, said the key issue was that government was yet to introduce a promised hydrogen certification scheme that would show what type of fuel was used to produce it. Until that was in place, the extent to which support for hydrogen would be encouraging fossil fuels rather than renewable energy remained unclear, he said.", "\u2018A bit of pub talk\u2019: Scott Morrison denies push for job in rugby league [2022-07-08T07:58:11Z]": "The former prime minister Scott Morrison has denied making a bid to join the Australian Rugby League Commission, describing the reports as \u201ca bit of pub talk\u201d. The Nine Network reported on Thursday that Morrison had spoken to \u201cpowerbrokers\u201d in rugby league and made it \u201cquite clear to them that he would like to be a part\u201d of the commission, which runs the code, despite there not being a vacancy. The discussions were reported to have occurred in the \u201clead-up\u201d to State of Origin I last month, which Morrison attended.

The Greens met on Monday evening to finalise their position on the voice, after not reaching a consensus during its party room retreat last week. Guardian Australia had earlier been told by multiple Greens sources that the party was expected to support the voice. The party room meeting resolved to support the necessary legislation to set up referendum and to campaign for Yes, with Bandt saying the Greens had received \u201cguarantees on Sovereignty and funding to progress Treaty and Truth\u201d from the Labor government. The written statement did not list details of the funding promises Bandt says the government provided. Guardian Australia contacted Linda Burney, minister for Indigenous Australians, for comment. The Greens agreement also includes a commitment to continue campaigning for the treaty and truth elements of the Uluru statement from the heart. \u201cThe referendum will be an opportunity for the country to show its support for First Nations justice. A strong First Nations body would be a further step towards true self-determination and justice,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a \u2018No\u2019 vote will get us closer to Treaty and Truth, but I respect that others in the First Nations community may have a different view on that.\u201d Thorpe, the Greens\u2019 First Nations spokesperson until quitting the party, has criticised the voice and instead implored supporters to campaign for a treaty first. The Greens decision all but guarantees the government will have enough votes to pass enabling legislation to set up the referendum. Bandt told a press conference earlier on Monday that negotiations with government were continuing.   Related: Lidia Thorpe quits Greens party to pursue black sovereignty    \u201cI\u2019m not going to pre-empt what my colleagues will decide.

This is who I am.\u201d Thorpe had raised concerns about Indigenous sovereignty, if the voice referendum were to pass. Legal experts, including the government\u2019s working group of leading constitutional lawyers, had rejected those concerns. The legal expert group on Friday issued a statement, later released publicly, noting that \u201call members of the Expert Group agreed that the draft provision would not affect the sovereignty of any group or body.\u201d The working group wrote to Bandt on Thursday, giving him the same legal advice from the constitutional expert group, which includes former High Court justice Kenneth Hayne, Prof George Williams and Prof Anne Twomey. The letter, obtained by Guardian Australia, notes that legal experts had \u201crepeatedly made it clear that the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution does not impact sovereignty\u201d. It also noted the specific advice of the internal expert group. \u201cWe look forward to confirmation of your support for this historic opportunity to advance reconciliation as set out in the Uluru statement from the heart,\u201d the letter read.   Related: Indigenous voice legislation to be introduced this parliamentary term if referendum succeeds, PM says    On 25 January, the Greens announced that Thorpe had informed her colleagues that she may vote against the party\u2019s position if the wider party room resolved to back the voice. The Greens\u2019 constitution allows members to go against the party position. The announcement was made the day before Australia Day and Invasion Day rallies, where Thorpe was a leading figure in advocating for treaty over voice, was widely seen as paving the way for the wider party room to support the voice. At the time, Bandt said the Greens were \u201cin active discussions with Labor to clarify further details on its approach to Truth, Treaty and Voice and First Nations justice policy\u201d.", "Daniel Andrews plans to revive the State Electricity Commission. What will it mean for Victoria\u2019s power? [2022-10-21T19:00:49Z]": "The Victorian government has announced it will revive the publicly owned State Electricity Commission and bring forward its net zero emissions goals if it is re-elected in November.  \nThe premier, Daniel Andrews, described the move as Victoria\u2019s \u201cmost significant energy announcement\u201d for 30 years. \nIt includes a $1bn investment to deliver 4.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, to be owned by the state and run by the rekindled SEC. \n\u201cThose power stations won\u2019t be for profit, they\u2019ll be for people,\u201d Andrews said.  \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nWhat is the SEC? \nFirst established in 1918, the SEC had by 1972 become Victoria\u2019s sole provider of electricity generation, transmission and networks, and even ran shops selling appliances. The electricity sector was privatised in the 1990s by the Liberal premier Jeff Kennett, a decision Andrews said had failed consumers and driven up power bills. \nThe Andrews Labor government plans to spend $20m to revive the commission and open an office in Morwell, in the Latrobe valley \u2013 the heart of Victoria\u2019s shuttering coal industry. The state will keep a 51% stake in the agency and its wind and solar projects. \u201cLike-minded entities\u201d, such as industry super funds, would be the preferred investors for the remaining share. \nThe SEC will \u201cconsider all options\u201d to operate profitably, Andrews said, including becoming a retailer. \nWhat does this mean for the energy market? \nIt\u2019s \u201cmuch more modest than the original SEC\u201d, said Alan Pears, an energy expert at RMIT University who worked in government agencies in the 1980s. \nIts restoration shows governments are \u201cno longer confident that the private sector can deliver\u201d the scale and speed needed to decarbonise the power sector, Pears said. \n \n  Related: Victoria set to re-enter electricity market after setting 95% renewable energy target  \n \nHowever, Tennant Reed, lead energy analyst for the AiGroup, said \u201cSEC Mark II\u201d was largely symbolic. While \u201cnot insignificant\u201d, the $1bn investment was a \u201ctoe in the water\u201d when compared with the forecast $180bn needed to be spent in coming decades across the industry, he said. \n\u201cThis is a new book, not just a new chapter,\u201d said Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre. He said Victoria already faced \u201cextremely tight timelines\u201d to expand clean energy capacity to cover coal plants as they exited. \nWhat are the government\u2019s new emissions targets? \nVictoria has brought forward its net zero target by five years to 2045, tugging it in line with the ACT. \nThe state\u2019s previous target was to reduce 2005-level emissions by 28%-33% by 2025, and 45%-50% by 2030. It will now seek to legislate the 2035 goal of a 75%-80% cut. \nVictoria also lifted its target for 95% of electricity to come from renewables by 2035, from a previous goal of 50-65% . \nThose higher goals were \u201ca lot more significant\u201d than the SEC revival, Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s well beyond business as usual.\u201d \nHow do the emissions goals stack up? \nNew South Wales and South Australia both have targets to halve 2005 emissions by 2030, on the way to achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century. Queensland\u2019s aim is for a 30% cut by 2030 and net zero 20 years later. The ACT\u2019s aim is for a 65%-75% reduction by 2030 and 90% by 2040.  \n Interactive \n \nInternational comparisons include California\u2019s 47% emissions cut by 2030 and a similar 2045 net zero goal. The UK, one of the more ambitious nations, has a 2030 goal of cutting 1990-level emissions by 68%. \nEnvironment Victoria\u2019s chief executive, Jono La Nauze, said Thursday\u2019s announcement marked a \u201cmonumental shift\u201d of \u201cglobal significance\u201d. \nAustralia\u2019s goal of a 43% cut from 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050 will also be aided by Victoria\u2019s accelerated efforts. \nHow will power bills be affected? \nVictoria is just one part of the National Electricity Market, so it depends how other states act. Queensland has previously said retaining state control over electricity assets gives it an edge in the shift to renewables, which allows it to offset the impact of higher energy prices.  \nThat\u2019s because the generation costs of renewable energy, even adding the costs of firming the power supply in the form of storage, are increasingly competitive against ageing coal and gas-fired power plants that also face rising fuel costs \nHowever, Sarah McNamara, CEO of generator lobby group the Australian Energy Council, described Victoria\u2019s move as a \u201cretrograde step\u201d that would \u201cdestabilise future investment plans\u201d. \n \n  Related: \u2018Rewiring the nation\u2019: Albanese and Andrews governments to jointly fund renewable energy zones  \n \nJeff Dimery, CEO of Alinta Energy, which owns the coal-fired Loy Yang B power station that now faces an exit by 2035, has raised concerns about how the state will support coal workers as the industry closes down.  \n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken strong steps to prepare for the transition, and have one of the most well-advanced renewables and storage project pipelines,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to understand more about how the government intends to manage the cost of the expedited transition, [and] protect communities and workers.\u201d \nPears said the government had a big incentive to succeed. \u201cIf the lights go out, it\u2019s the state government that loses power,\u201d he said.  \nWhat\u2019s next? \nVictoria\u2019s determination to intervene in the market may form part of a growing trend of market intervention to achieve emissions reductions targets, Reed said.  \nOther interventions include the Turnbull-Morrison government\u2019s wielding of the commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro to build a massive pumped-hydro venture and a gas-fired power plant, and the NSW government\u2019s energy roadmap which aims to attract investment in renewables.  \nMountain said governments should prepare for the transition by reviewing the role of overarching bodies \u2013 the Australian Energy Market Operator, the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Regulator \u2013 while putting the Energy Security Board \u201cout to pasture\u201d. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge frustration with the way the NEM has moved,\u201d Mountain said. \u201cStates are increasingly doing their own things.\u201d", "Kevin Rudd complaint questions why News Corp did not need to register under foreign influence scheme [2022-11-07T03:24:30Z]": "Kevin Rudd\u2019s staff accused an Australian government department of taking a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach to News Corp after finding the media company did not need to register under the foreign influence scheme. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal the Attorney General\u2019s Department dismissed two cases that the former prime minister suggested may require News Corp to disclose activities under the scheme. In a letter released under freedom of information laws, Rudd cited the reporting by the Saturday Telegraph in May 2020 about Covid\u2019s origins, which appeared under the headline \u201cChina\u2019s batty science: Bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d. The details in this \u201cworld exclusive\u201d were attributed to \u201ca dossier prepared by concerned western governments\u201d. Rudd drew attention to previously published advice by Bret Walker SC.   Related: Kevin Rudd registers interviews with BBC and Radio NZ but insists \u2018I am not a foreign agent\u2019    \u201cThis advice noted that, in the absence of an exemption for media activities, any decision of News Corp Australia to receive and distribute information on behalf of a foreign government seeking to influence political discourse in Australia would be registrable,\u201d Rudd wrote in the October 2021 letter. \u201cAs you would be aware, numerous individuals have raised concern about the broad interpretation of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act including Gareth Evans, Malcolm Turnbull and me. \u201cIt would be damaging to public confidence in the scheme if your department, having taken such a firm approach with critics of the present [Morrison] government, were seen to continually give the government\u2019s greatest supporter an easy ride.\u201d The department\u2019s secretary, Katherine Jones, sent a formal response four months later, saying the department had considered the issues raised and \u201cdoes not have any information indicating\u201d that the report on \u201cChina\u2019s batty science\u201d was registrable under the scheme. \u201cIn particular, it is not clear that any activities related to publishing the report were undertaken on behalf of an identified foreign principal,\u201d she wrote in February 2022.    In the letter, Rudd also asked the head of the department for \u201cadvice on whether News Corp Australia has undertaken a registrable act on behalf of Audi, an entity related to governments in Qatar and Germany\u201d. In its general advice to the public, the department says people \u201cundertaking communications activities for the purpose of political or government influence on behalf of a foreign principal must register their activity, unless an exemption applies\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Rudd cited a 12-page liftout in the Australian newspaper called \u201cElectric Vehicles Special Report\u201d in September 2021, which included a number of full-page Audi advertisements and also included \u201cseveral articles lobbying government to enact policies favourable to Audi\u2019s electric vehicles\u201d. \u201cIt is my understanding that such \u2018special reports\u2019 have the appearance of news coverage, but they are in fact produced under a formal commercial arrangement in which News Corp Australia undertakes to supply coverage in exchange for a large advertising commitment,\u201d Rudd wrote. The lift-out also included an article authored by Paul Sansom, the chief executive of Audi Australia, which said there was \u201cmuch more to discuss around a federally led EV incentive strategy\u201d and the company would \u201clike to hear more about EV incentives from the federal government\u201d. Rudd also pointed out that the series was accompanied by sponsored posts on Facebook. His letter said Audi was a fully owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, whose largest shareholders included the State of Lower Saxony (20% of the voting rights) and Qatar Holding LLC (17%). He said these were, respectively, a foreign sub-national government in Germany and an arm of the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. Jones wrote back to Rudd saying the department dealt with issues on a case-by-case basis, and its compliance strategy preferred to resolve matters through voluntary cooperation with registrants or potential registrants wherever possible.    She acknowledged Rudd\u2019s feedback about the potential need for amendments to clarify the laws as they applied to media organisations and said the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security was reviewing whether the scheme remained \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Jones said the department believed \u201cthat the available information is not sufficient to indicate that the special report constitutes a registrable activity undertaken on behalf of a foreign principal\u201d. \u201cThose parts of the special report that are clearly labelled as Audi-produced material, including the article from the CEO of Audi Australia, would fall under the Act\u2019s \u2018disseminator exemption\u2019 for material produced by third parties,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cFor other articles in the special report containing discussion of federal policy settings in relation to electric vehicles, the department is not able to determine that they constitute an activity undertaken on behalf of a foreign principal within the meaning of the Act.\u201d A staffer to Rudd replied to the public servant who had emailed a copy of the letter: \u201cSo in summary: News Corporation can be paid by a foreign government-related entity to assign their journalists write articles supporting their interests vis-\u00e0-vis regulation of their interests in Australia, but because neither News Corp or the foreign principal elects to tell the department, the department doesn\u2019t want to know? \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d The department declined to provide further comment when contacted by Guardian Australia, with a spokesperson saying the letter from Jones set out the department\u2019s views. News Corp did not respond to a request for a response. Since leaving politics, Rudd has become one of News Corp\u2019s most trenchant critics and has spearheaded a campaign for a royal commission. The Labor state conference in Queensland on Sunday passed a resolution calling on the federal government to establish a royal commission into media diversity in Australia. The newly obtained documents cover all correspondence between former prime ministers and the Attorney General\u2019s Department since September 2021, and mostly showed Rudd\u2019s office contacting officials to clarify his own registration requirements. Based on expansive departmental advice, Rudd has used the register to disclose a wide range of activities, including interviews with state-owned broadcasters. But in one case, the department informed Rudd that his registration lodged in December 2021 for a book launch on behalf of the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne was unnecessary. \u201cThe department\u2019s understanding is that individual dioceses and archdioceses of the Catholic church in Australia are, for relevant purposes, separate from the Holy See and Vatican City State, and individual dioceses and archdioceses do not form part of a foreign government in their own right.\u201d The documents also show the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull having difficulty signing in to the website after the start of the 2022 election campaign, when registrants are required to update and confirm any disclosures. In one email to the department, subject line \u201cRe: reset password\u201d, Turnbull wrote: \u201cThanks for this email. I have despite several attempts not been able to log on to the website. I have no changes to report to my earlier filing.

The rates were even higher in capital cities \u2013 jumping to 25% \u2013 compared with one in eight in the regions. Most people living in eastern Australia in August 2021 were subject to lockdown restrictions. With much of the nation confined to their homes amid Covid outbreaks, 2.5 million of the 12 million people employed on census day were working remotely, accounting for just over 20% of the working population.   Interactive   In New South Wales, where greater Sydney and large parts of the state were subject to strict stay-at-home orders, the figure was even higher, with 31% working from home, followed by 26% in Victoria. Comparatively, just 4% of the Northern Territory\u2019s relatively Covid-free population were set up remotely. The census general manager, Duncan Young, said working-from-home rates increased by nearly four times \u201cright across the country\u201d but were most stark in NSW, which had been in lockdown for six weeks prior to census night.   Interactive   \u201cNearly half of people working from home were in NSW,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in South Australia and Tasmania it was still about 10% of the workforce \u2013 significantly higher than 2016. There was a shift there regardless of lockdown being experienced.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning  The Australian statistician Dr David Gruen said the unusual 2021 census provided \u201cfascinating insight\u201d into how Australians worked and lived during a global pandemic. \u201cCovid-19 restrictions in NSW contributed to unprecedented results,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, 15% of people employed in the construction industry in NSW worked zero hours. This contrasts to the rest of Australia, with 3% of the people employed in construction working zero hours.\u201d   Interactive   Overall, almost 7% of employed people worked zero hours in the week before the census, more than double the rate in 2016, when 3% were out of the workplace. Reasons included taking leave and being unable to work due to self-isolation requirements or lockdown restrictions. Some occupations were hit by Covid harder than others, largely due to a near-total shutdown of the entertainment and hospitality sectors. Arts and recreation were most severely affected, with 15.3% of employees working zero hours, followed by accommodation and food services (12.8%) and mining (9%).   Related: Ten things we learned from the 2021 census results: Christianity in decline and Australia hits 25 million    The picture differed by state and territory. In shuttered NSW, 23% of employed arts and recreation workers worked zero hours, followed by 20% in Queensland and 14% in Victoria. Industries reliant on travel also struggled with the suspension of international flights. The number of employed tourism and travel advisers more than halved compared with the last census. In contrast, \u201cessential\u201d services and professions that were relatively easy to transition remotely including professional, scientific and technical services, financial and insurance services and agriculture, forestry and fishing were broadly untouched. Other sectors boomed because, not in spite of, lockdowns. With Australians turning to takeaway services in droves, the number of delivery drivers jumped by more than 70%, while there was also an 8.7% increase in truck drivers. Meanwhile, Australians were working fewer hours and flocking to part-time work. The number of people working 40 hours or more a week dropped by 7% in the latest census compared with a decade ago (38% compared with 45%). Full-time work is defined as 35 or more hours a week. Young said people working part-time had jumped by 3% since the 2016 census (30% to 33%), a \u201cnotable\u201d five-year increase.   Related: Census 2021: how Covid-19 changed Australia \u2013 search the ABS data for your town or suburb    Yet of the 4 million Australians working part-time, the vast majority (2.6 million) were women and two in three of the 7 million working full-time were men. Housework wasn\u2019t equally shared. Just 10% of men employed full-time undertook 15 or more hours of domestic work a week, less than half the rate of women (21%). Slightly more men employed part-time completed a similar rate of domestic work (15%) however it was compared to 32% of women in the same bracket. Young said the census always provided a \u201csnapshot\u201d in time, but filling it out during a year of unprecedented circumstances meant some trends were likelier to be shorter-lived than others. \u201cWill 2026 be more like 2016 or more like 2021?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us think the world will go back to how it was in 2016, but obviously the impacts of lockdowns won\u2019t be in place.

Instead, it peaked at 12.05m on Monday morning. \n\u201cThat 15cm makes a significant difference to the number of properties either isolated or impacted, so we believe around 4,000 properties are now either isolated or have some levels of inundation,\u201d he said. \nMost residents from the Aboriginal community of Cummeragunja, on the banks of the Murray on the border of NSW and Victoria, evacuated on Monday. \nBelinda Day works for the local Health and Development Aboriginal Corporation and told Guardian Australia that residents initially feared leaving their homes and wanted to stay. \n\u201cThe majority had elected that they were going to stay on country but we\u2019ve had New South Wales police out this morning doing door knocking advising that it is actually a mandatory evacuation.\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re going to either relocate themselves to family or friends or they\u2019re going to go into Moama and access the evacuation centre there and seek some support,\u201d Day said. \nThe Campaspe River near Rochester was starting to recede, allowing for impact assessments to begin. It was thought 85% of properties in the rural town \u2013 up to 900 homes \u2013 had been inundated, Wiebusch said. A 71-year-old Rochester man died in floodwaters in his backyard on Saturday. \nSES members have completed more than 650 flood rescues since the flood event began last week and have responded to 6,000 requests for emergency assistance. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nSpeaking at the state\u2019s emergency control centre on Monday, Andrews said $165m would be spent on an emergency road repair blitz, which had already begun, to fix potholes and repair road surfaces. \nThe funding would also cover larger-scale works, including the rebuilding of roads, bridges and culverts, particularly in the Hume, Loddon Mallee and Western regions, which have been the worst affected to date. \nAndrews said the immediate focus was making key roads safe so emergency services and vital supplies can reach affected communities ahead of more rain forecast later in the week. \n \n  Related: Victoria floods: nervous night in Shepparton but Goulburn River peaks lower than expected  \n \nClean-up efforts had also begun in Maribyrnong, Melbourne, where police are investigating reports of looting. \nThe emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, said a flood victim who had evacuated last week had returned home to find they had been burgled. \nPolice were on Monday looking for a blue Ford Territory which pulled up outside a Burton Crescent home at around 7am on Monday. \n\u201cWe see the absolute best in behaviour across all of our Victorians,\u201d Crisp said. \u201cSadly, we also see the absolute worst in behaviour.\u201d \nCrisp said more than 100 Australian defence force troops had been deployed to flood-affected areas. \nThe premier said more than 11,000 people had applied for emergency support payments since they opened on Friday. \nOn Monday federal emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said modelling indicated more than 9,000 homes were flooded in northern Victoria and more than 34,000 homes across the state could be flooded or isolated with water or isolated. \n \n  Related: \u2018Just too much rain\u2019: small-town Australians survey damage after massive flooding  \n \nAn emergency re-establishment assistance fund will also provide up to $42,250 for uninsured properties. \nThe Victorian opposition welcomed the funding but continued to call for the government to declare a natural disaster to provide certainty and unlock further funding and support from the commonwealth. \nHowever, Crisp said there would be \u201cno benefit whatsoever\u201d to declare a state of disaster at this stage. \nAndrews said the state and federal governments were working to finalise disaster recovery funding arrangements. \n- With AAP", "Victoria deserves praise for promising a rapid shift from coal to renewables. Now comes the hard part | Adam Morton [2022-10-23T15:00:40Z]": "Transformations don\u2019t come much bigger than that proposed in Victoria by Daniel Andrews last week. At the time of typing, about two-thirds of the electricity generated in Victoria comes from burning brown coal \u2013 basically mud \u2013 in old, sometimes failing, generators in the Latrobe Valley. It is the most polluting form of large-scale power generation. If the Andrews Labor government wins a third term at next month\u2019s state election, which seems likely, it has promised to legislate a target that would mean shutting the remaining coal plants and replacing them with renewable energy and back-up generation by 2035 \u2013 and probably earlier.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  It would be one of the fastest transitions from a high-pollution power grid to a near zero-emissions system anywhere in the world. Just as significantly, the announcement by the Victorian premier and his climate and energy minister, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, accelerated the state\u2019s emissions reduction plans with a promise of a 75-80% cut by 2035 (compared with 2005 levels). Victoria also has a new timeframe in which it is pledging to reach net zero emissions \u2013 2045, rather than 2050. These commitments far outstrip what is promised nationally and could put the state within reach of what is required to play its part in attempting to limit global heating to 1.5C, as national leaders promised in Paris in 2015.   Related: Australian research finds cost-effective way to recycle solar panels    There are important questions to be answered about how this will be achieved and what it will mean for households and businesses, but the goals should be acknowledged and applauded. This is the path governments are supposed to be setting. Part of the commitment is piggybacking on other announcements. The rise of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day has quickly been making ageing coal plants less viable, and the owners of two of Victoria\u2019s remaining three generators \u2013 Yallourn and Loy Yang A \u2013 have already brought forward their closure dates to 2028 and 2035 respectively. It means the new bit in Andrews\u2019 promise of 95% renewable energy by 2035 is really that the final plant, Loy Yang B, will shut by then, and not in 2047 as currently scheduled. This was apparently news to the owner, Alinta Energy, and its staff. But few people following the energy market believe it could have lasted as long as claimed anyway. The coal closures will do a big chunk of the heavy lifting in meeting Victoria\u2019s more ambitious emissions reduction targets, but not all of it. The state will also need to do more in the next term to cut pollution in other areas \u2013 transport, industry, manufacturing and agriculture \u2013 than currently proposed. And it will also need to rapidly reduce homes and businesses\u2019 reliance on gas for heating and cooking. Probably the least remarkable part of the Victorian promise is the section it chose to emphasise as the most important \u2013 the revival of the State Electricity Commission, which owned and ran the coal plants and poles and wires until then premier Jeff Kennett broke up and sold the system in the 1990s privatisation mania.    Big change rarely comes smoothly, and premiers get votes for building things    Andrews and D\u2019Ambrosio said this move would be \u201cputting power back in the hands of Victorians\u201d. One newspaper headline went further, saying the premier was \u201cnationalising electricity\u201d. The reality is noteworthy but a bit more anodyne, for a couple of reasons. What is proposed is a much smaller operation than the old SEC, and the government is not (at least at this stage) taking back control of the state\u2019s existing power plants, poles and wires or retailers. The rebooted commission would instead be a new player in the market, effectively competing with private companies. The government would initially kick in $1bn as it starts the process of building 4.5GW of new renewable energy capacity. It expects further investment in SEC projects from \u201clike-minded entities\u201d such as industry super funds, but the government would retain a controlling stake. It is a significant commitment, but just a fraction of what the state will need to replace its coal plants. A major focus appears likely to be the establishment of an offshore wind energy industry in Gippsland. The government has set substantial targets for offshore wind generation, but turbines are more expensive when built kilometres off the coast than in a paddock, and are unlikely to be competitive initially without public support.  Ignore the historic connotations of the SEC\u2019s name and the Victorian commitment can be seen as just the latest in a wave of announcements, mostly by state governments, that have upended expert thinking of how the future electricity system would \u2013 or should \u2013 be rebuilt. The long-held idea that investment in the new clean grid would be driven by an overarching national policy, such as a carbon price, with governments otherwise mostly taking a hands-off approach seems increasingly quaint. It was killed off as the federal Coalition spent years blocking climate action, and isn\u2019t coming back. Instead we have a messy, bottom-up approach in which governments working in the same general direction make their own commitments. Last month, the Queensland government said it would spend an extra $4bn on transforming the energy system, building at least 2,000 more wind turbines and 35m solar panels by 2030 to end its reliance on coal by about 2035. The New South Wales Coalition government is working on underwriting 12GW of new renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage and the treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, has said the state could be out of coal power by 2030. Everyone is choosing their own adventure. The difference since May is that the commonwealth and states are pulling in the same direction, with the Albanese government committing to accelerate the transition by committing billions in funding for new transmission connections, including the Marinus link between Tasmania and Victoria announced last week. It is a process that drives economists and energy market purists slightly mad, but a version of it was probably politically inevitable. Big change rarely comes smoothly, and premiers get votes for building things.   Related: Albanese government urged to adopt windfall profits tax after LNG exporters\u2019 $40bn bonanza    Most people won\u2019t care about these structural and ownership issues. The big questions the Victorian government and others will have to answer in the years ahead are more basic. Will the new system deliver the reliable, clean and affordable electricity promised? And will coal-reliant communities be supported through what will be a historically abrupt change? Reliability and emissions reduction goals will not be easy but are technically achievable. Cost is a separate question. New solar and wind are clearly the cheapest forms of energy available and a system that mostly runs on them should lower generation costs, but someone will have to pay for the vast amounts of new transmission being built. Expensive gas-fired power is likely to also push up prices for as long as it is used alongside an expanding storage network to fill gaps in supply. . The cost of a renewably powered electricity grid will be lower than a system that runs on coal or nuclear, but that does not mean it will necessarily be cheap \u2013 and consumers will not see that comparison.

Nestled on the western edge of the Blue Mountains about two hours from Sydney, the gritty industrial town hosted Australia\u2019s first steelworks. Residents were given coal for next to nothing to burn during the cold winters. \u201cThe place was just full of smog,\u201d says Chris Jonkers, now an activist with the Lithgow Environment Group, whose father worked in the nearby state coalmine for about nine years before its closure in 1964. \u201cHe\u2019d come home black every day.\u201d Casting off that image hasn\u2019t been easy. The town\u2019s mayor, Maree Statham, admits some members of the Australian Caravan Club, which this week drew 120 vans to a large sporting field, were wary of this year\u2019s choice for their annual muster. \u201cA lot of them thought that they would drive down a hill and see all this smog,\u201d Statham says. \u201cWell, I said, \u2018that hasn\u2019t happened for a very long time\u2019.\u201d Now the challenge is almost the opposite. As with towns in the Hunter region of NSW and Victoria\u2019s Latrobe valley, where the exit from coalmining and power generation is also under way, Lithgow needs to attract new industries in a hurry.    \u201cWe\u2019ve got to try and be prepared now for what\u2019s going to be racing up to us,\u201d Statham says. \u201cIt\u2019s not crawling.\u201d Craig Butler, Lithgow council\u2019s general manager, says the lesson from other regions where \u201cwe fall off the cliff or when economies collapse\u201d is that the government response typically fails. \u201cTransitioning the economy isn\u2019t easy \u2013 it\u2019s costly and it takes many years,\u201d Butler says. \u201cHow do you find your way into the future?\u201d Potential power vacuum One handicap is not knowing when Lithgow\u2019s remaining power station, EnergyAustralia\u2019s 1,430MW Mount Piper plant, and three coalmines owned by Centennial Coal will cease operation. The closures may come much sooner than is widely understood and would trigger shockwaves to the region. Butler says a third of the area\u2019s output is at stake. The Mount Piper plant relies on Centennial\u2019s Springvale mine for most of its coal and supplies up to 15% of the state\u2019s power. A spokesperson for Hong Kong-owned EnergyAustralia said it was impossible to say with any certainty when Mount Piper might close. \u201cWhile we have now committed to transition out of coal-fired power generation by 2040, the final closure date for Mount Piper will be dependent on factors such as fuel supply arrangements, alternative dispatchable capacity in place and decisions of other investors,\u201d the spokesperson said.    Earlier this month, the company said it was studying the feasibility of a giant 500MW battery for the Mount Piper site. If approved, it could power about 200,000 homes for four hours a day by the end of 2026. EnergyAustralia said the battery was \u201cnot intended as a replacement for energy generation\u201d, but Statham says the plan indicates the life of the plant \u201cmay be less\u201d than what has been stated publicly. NSW is already facing a potential supply gap, with Eraring, Australia\u2019s biggest fossil-fuel power plant at 2,880MW, closing as soon as 2025, one government insider said. Another person familiar with the state\u2019s energy policy said he would be \u201cshocked\u201d if Mount Piper closed before 2030. Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne, said it would not be a big surprise if Mount Piper exited \u201cwell before 2040\u201d, but closure within a few years would be \u201can extremely difficult, likely impossible proposition for NSW\u201d. Workers in the industries are certainly wary that, as in other regions, closures may be brought forward with little notice. Gus Maloney, an underground supervisor at Springvale, reckons his mine has about four years to run. Clarence \u2013 thought to be Centennial\u2019s only profitable mine because it exports at far higher prices than are capped at Mount Piper \u2013 \u201chas got a bit longer than us but not a great deal\u201d. The region\u2019s coal reserves are depleted after more than a century and a half of extraction and what\u2019s left can be difficult to mine. Springvale \u201cis just non-stop pumping\u201d because of water seepage, Maloney says. Ironically, some of it comes from the long-abandoned state mine nearby, which has filled with water. At stake are the jobs of more than 300 miners at both Springvale and Clarence, and many more supported by suppliers. Maloney says miners who earn an average of about $120,000 a year would be lucky to make half that in other fields if the mines close.    Maloney, 42, has spent almost 25 years in mining, following his father into the pits. Last week, he farewelled a \u201cyoung bloke\u201d doing a similar job at Clarence who is moving his family to a coalmine in central Queensland. To give himself more options, Maloney is studying to be a project manager and isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019ll stay in Lithgow. Thailand-owned Centennial says it employs about 830 people and contributes hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the local economy. \u201cWe expect both Springvale and Clarence mines to continue operating into the future, providing the Lithgow region with strong and stable employment,\u201d a spokesperson said. It also \u201clooks forward to continuing\u201d its partnership with EnergyAustralia and \u201cworking through supply options\u201d. Alternatives meet opposition What fills the economic void, though, isn\u2019t clear, particularly as there is local opposition to some of the major alternatives. EnergyAustralia has proposed a 335MW pumped-hydro plant using its own land and water, but some residents worry about a potentially \u201cmonstrous\u201d dam being built on the town-facing side of Mount Walker and the loss of amenity as water levels rise and fall daily on Lake Lyall below.    Similarly, plans for a $700m waste-to-energy incinerator to be built on the site of Lithgow\u2019s other old power plant, the defunct Wallerawang power station, won council support only to be ruled out by the NSW deputy premier, Paul Toole, in May. \u201cWe should always be looking at new initiatives and ways of bringing new industry and jobs to the area but it\u2019s critical these industries have the backing of the community,\u201d says Toole, the state National party leader who is also the MP for the region. Ann Thompson, the president of the Lithgow District Chamber of Commerce and a former councillor, says the people of the area \u201cdeserve better than taking 700,000 tonnes a year of Sydney\u2019s waste\u201d.

Supporters of the project include the local business group Back to Basics, of which Maloney is a member, and the Black Gold Motel, located right next to the partly demolished power station.   Interactive   Brad Cluff, who helps his family run the motel, says the region needs such new investment, given the promise of a 50MW plant, proposed greenhouses and other businesses. He worries that a \u201cloud minority voice is all that\u2019s needed to block new ventures Lithgow badly needs\u201d. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter what sort of change it was that was going to occur. \u2018I don\u2019t want my life interrupted by change, I want it to be as of yesterday\u2019\u2013 that\u2019s exactly how they did it,\u201dCluff says.

The charity Foodbank\u2019s annual Hunger Report, to be released on Monday for Anti Poverty Week, surveyed more than 4,000 Australian adults, finding the problem extended beyond those on fixed incomes and was affecting many people in work. The report estimated about 500,000 households on any given day experience food insecurity, which describes being uncertain about getting enough food and compromising on nutrition through to disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake. The chief executive of Foodbank, Brianna Casey, said the situation was as bad as she had seen it in her six years in the job. She called for an increase to income support payments and additional support for the community sector.

The report said 21% of Australians \u2013 or more than 2 million people \u2013 had experienced severe food insecurity in the past 12 months. That was up from 17% on its 2021 report.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Past estimates have put the rate of food insecurity in Australia between 4% and 14%, while a UN report said 16% of Australian children under 15 lived with an adult who was food insecure in 2017. Meanwhile, a Guardian Australia analysis last year found significant growth in food relief across Australia over the past decade. The new Foodbank report said that among those experiencing food insecurity, 64% cited increased or high living expenses and 42% pointed to \u201creduced or low income or government benefits\u201d as a key cause. Among those experiencing severe food insecurity, 67% said their circumstances were worse this year than last. Households with children reported food insecurity at 1.5 times the national average, while about a third of people in work had experienced it in some form in the past year. The report said the diverse range of people facing food insecurity was likely to increase \u201cdue to the range of external factors affecting households which may never have experienced food insecurity before\u201d, such as the increasing cost of living, the frequency and severity of natural disasters and the pandemic. Only two in five households who reported being food insecure had sought food relief, a statistic attributed to ongoing stigma and practical factors such as a lack of access or eligibility. One person who has sought assistance is Jane*, 27, a single mother to a three-year-old daughter living in a private rental in New South Wales. Jane receives the single parenting payment while also working casually and studying to become a teacher. Jane said she was forced to seek help from local charities during weeks-long periods of unpaid practice for her university degree.

One carbon credit is meant to represent one tonne of carbon dioxide. Credits can then be sold to the government or polluting businesses, which use them to offset their onsite emissions. \n \n  Related: Australia\u2019s biggest carbon credits generator joins calls for overhaul of emissions offsets scheme  \n \nMacintosh, an environmental law and policy professor at the Australian National University and former head of the government\u2019s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, said the analysis found compelling evidence of widespread problems with forest regeneration projects. \nHe said some projects that used the human-induced regeneration (HIR) method had been awarded carbon credits for managed forest regeneration when it had not occurred, and others for regeneration that would have occurred anyway because it was mostly just due to rainfall. \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    Carbon offsets are used by the government and polluting companies as an alternative to cutting carbon dioxide emissions.\n    Instead of reducing their own pollution, they can choose to buy offsets - known as Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) - that are meant to represent a reduction in emissions elsewhere.\n    Each carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has either been stopped from going in the atmosphere, or sucked out of it.\n    Methods approved to generate carbon credits in Australia include regenerating native forest that has been cleared, protecting a forest that would otherwise have been cleared (known as \u201cavoided deforestation\u201d) and capturing and using emissions that leak from landfill sites to generate electricity.\n    Credits were bought by the government through the $4.5bn taxpayer-funded emissions reduction scheme or, increasingly, by polluters on the private market.&nbsp;\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe academics from ANU and the University of NSW said in nearly all cases they found tree growth followed the same rainfall-driven pattern in both managed carbon credit project areas and in neighbouring areas that had not been managed to capture carbon dioxide. \nThe team examined 169 projects that together received about 24m credits between 2015 and 2021. They said 92 projects in NSW received 13.6m carbon credits, but the combined area of forest and sparse woody vegetation cover in the affected areas was more than 10,000 hectares less than when the projects were first registered. In Queensland, they said, 73 projects were found to have received 9.9m carbon credits while forest cover went backwards by more than 50,000 hectares. \n \n Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup \n \nMacintosh, who has previously described the carbon credit system as a \u201csham\u201d and a fraud on taxpayers and the environment, said the results were alarming but should not be surprising. He said decades of research in mostly dry landscapes indicated that changing livestock and feral animal grazing practices \u2013 the method used under human-induced regeneration \u2013 had relatively little impact on tree and shrub cover. \nHe said the analysis should prompt \u201csome soul searching within the commonwealth government\u201d, and that responsibility mostly sat with the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the scheme. \n\u201cThe way in which it has occurred and been allowed to continue raise material questions about the Australian government\u2019s capacity to operate schemes of this nature,\u201d he said. \nClaims disputed \nThe claims are a focus of the government review of the carbon credit scheme led by Prof Ian Chubb, a former national chief scientist. They are disputed by some companies that manage nature-based projects to store carbon in vegetation.  \nClimate Friendly, which was set up nearly 20 years ago by former CSIRO scientists and has a target of delivering 100m tonnes of emissions abatement by 2025, said it had \u201ca large volume of data\u201d that showed older projects had increased forest cover once grazing practices were changed. It said it expected satellite data would show forest cover had started to increase on more recent project sites this year. \nIts argument is that high rainfall is necessary for significant regrowth, but it would not have happened without changes in grazing practices. It said projects that reduced the amount of grazing in a given area had a similar impact on forest regrowth as projects that stopped land clearing. \nClimate Friendly said this was backed by 81 field measurements by the CSIRO that found there was more carbon stored in regenerating trees across three project sites than it was being credited for. It argued the model used to estimate carbon credit claims, known as FullCAM, was inherently conservative. \nClimate Friendly\u2019s co-chief executive, Skye Glenday, said the company believed there should be more freedom to make carbon crediting data public. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re purchasing a tonne [of carbon abatement] you can be certain you are getting a tonne,\u201d she said. \n \n  Related: \u2018Fix the faults\u2019: Coles criticised for using carbon credits from controversial project  \n \nGreenCollar, which describes itself as Australia\u2019s largest environmental markets investor, has said it was confident its projects regrowing native forests were generating real emissions reductions, but there were broader issues with measurement and governance. \nAs reported by Guardian Australia, GreenCollar released a joint statement with Macintosh and his colleagues last month describing \u201cfundamental problems\u201d with the governance of the scheme. It said it disagreed with Macintosh on several points, but agreed the scheme needed to be overhauled to improve measurement of how much carbon dioxide was being drawn from the atmosphere, and to improve the governance of the system overseen by the Clean Energy Regulator. \nIn a statement in response to Macintosh\u2019s latest paper, GreenCollar chief executive, James Schultz, said the company was eager to work with people and organisations that were \u201cequally keen to achieve the highest integrity carbon abatement system and market Australia can achieve\u201d. He said carbon crediting methodologies were \u201cnot static\u201d. \n\u201cThey evolve as advances in scientific and technical knowledge advance,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all the projects we manage, GreenCollar is dedicated to real, measurable and verifiable outcomes that genuinely deliver results for our environment.\u201d \nGreenCollar and Macintosh both said the regulator had too many roles and was potentially conflicted. They called for some of its powers, including preparing methods under which carbon credits are created, to be given to other agencies. \nThe Clean Energy Regulator has rejected these criticisms. In a statement in June, it said Macintosh and his colleagues had failed to present robust evidence of a lack of integrity in the system and based their analysis on an incomplete dataset. In response to the latest paper, a spokesperson for the regulator said it welcomed the government\u2019s review and noted it was due to report at the end of the year. \n\u2018Judgment call\u2019 \nChubb has acknowledged there is a widespread view that the governance of the scheme needs to change. \nSpeaking at the Australasian Emissions Reduction Summit last month, he said there was \u201ca view, through no fault of its own, that the regulator has been asked to do multiple tasks which some people see as a potential for conflict and that we should seek to simplify\u201d. He said there had been a widespread call for greater transparency to allow validation of data. \nThe review panel has not given a view on submissions from Macintosh and his colleagues \u2013 Dr Pablo Larraondo, Prof Don Butler, Dr Dean Ansell, Marie Waschka and Dr Megan Evans \u2013 about the need for changes to the methods used to generate credits. Some of the proposed changes have industry support. Several companies that run projects to cut emissions from landfill sites have backed analysis by Macintosh that found the method covering their industry was generating meaningless credits and resulted in emissions increasing. \nChubb told the conference: \u201cSomewhere along the line, this group [the panel] will have to make a judgment call about where the weight of evidence lies, and if and how we can improve it so that the trust issue improves and the value of the whole scheme increases.\u201d \nChubb, Macintosh and the companies working in the field all support the use of carbon offsets to help reduce emissions, but have said they should not be used as an excuse for polluters to delay their own cuts. Chubb recently said big emitters should not be able to use offsets to avoid doing something about reducing their own emissions. \nOthers have gone further. A recent report by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, cited expert opinion that offsetting emissions should be a last resort, used only in hard-to-abate sectors, and should not be available to all polluters.  \nBill Hare, a climate scientist and the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said many environmental policy experts supported a bigger change in how and when credits could be used. It was necessary in part because the evidence showed sequestering carbon in trees was not the same as cutting fossil fuel emissions, he said. \nWriting in the Conversation, he said every tonne of carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels had \u201ca very long tail\u201d in the atmosphere. About 40% of it would survive after a century and 20% after 10,000 years. \nBy contrast, the Australian scheme considers carbon credits a permanent reduction in emissions if they last between 25 and 100 years, depending on the project. Hare said it meant offsets needed to be \u201cvery good to be worthwhile\u201d. \n\u201cIf they\u2019re not real, additional and permanent \u2013 or if they\u2019re used to continue fossil fuel emissions \u2013 then they will make climate change worse rather than better,\u201d he said.", "Australian defence force troops to train Ukrainian soldiers in the UK [2022-10-26T11:30:00Z]": "Up to 70 Australian defence force personnel will be deployed to the UK to train Ukrainian troops in the latest increase in Australia\u2019s support for Kyiv.

On Wednesday a joint law enforcement agency inquiry into money laundering in NSW issued a damning final report that found \u201clarge sums\u201d of the proceeds of crime are gambled by criminals in pubs and clubs across the state, \u201crewarding and perpetuating crime in the community\u201d. Led by the powerful New South Wales Crime Commission, the report also called for the introduction of a cashless gambling card to combat what it called \u201ca $95bn-a-year information black hole\u201d. In findings that will heap pressure on the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, to introduce a cashless gambling card, the commission found its introduction would be a valuable tool in \u201cbreaking the link between organised crime and gaming machines\u201d.

In December the crime commission, which has royal commission-style powers and investigates serious crime, announced it would run a dedicated inquiry into money laundering via the state\u2019s poker machines. It has previously suggested some of the state\u2019s gambling laws have increased the risk of money laundering through poker machines. Its commissioner, Michael Barnes, said the review had found poker machines \u201coffered criminals one of the last remaining safe havens where cash from criminal enterprises could be \u2018cleaned\u2019 or gambled with virtual impunity\u201d. \u201cAt the moment serious offenders can enter NSW pubs and clubs, sit down next to patrons in gaming rooms, and openly feed large sums of cash from their crimes into poker machines with no real fear of detection,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThe lack of traceable data collected by [poker machines] means the exact scale of this criminal activity is impossible to determine but it is clear from our investigations it involves many billions of dollars every year.\u201d The introduction of the cashless gambling card, the inquiry found, would \u201cminimise money laundering associated with [poker machines] by removing anonymity and increasing traceability of \u2026 related transactions\u201d. \u201cThis will enable law enforcement to identify and respond to money laundering and will improve data analytics around gambling and money laundering,\u201d the report states.   Related: NSW poker machine laws may increase risk of money laundering, says crime commission     The government is currently trialing a voluntary cashless gambling scheme in Newcastle, part of a compromise deal struck with the industry. But the commission was scathing in its assessment of a voluntary model, saying it would \u201cnot address money laundering as criminals dealing with the proceeds of crime will simply use cash\u201d. \u201cA hybrid/voluntary system will likely make pubs and clubs more attractive venues for money launderers as hybrid player card systems could be exploited to make \u2018cleaning\u2019 easier,\u201d the report found. The commission also found that while the \u201ccleaning\u201d of the proceeds of crime was not widespread in clubs and pubs because it was inefficient \u201ccompared to other avenues for laundering\u201d, large sums of the proceeds of crime \u201care being gambled by criminals in pubs and clubs across the state\u201d. \u201cIt is a deeply concerning peculiarity that in the largely cashless digital economy in which we live that gambling in NSW pubs and clubs remains a $95bn-a-year information black hole.

What can I do to protect myself? [2022-11-11T06:08:21Z]": "Millions of Medibank\u2019s current and former customers have had their personal information, including health claims, exposed in a hack of the company\u2019s customer database. Here\u2019s what we know so far, and what you can do. Am I affected? If you are a customer of Medibank or its subsidiary ahm, or are an international student with Medibank, or you have been a customer in the last seven years or longer, it\u2019s likely your data has been exposed in the breach. The company has said 9.7 million customers in total are exposed. That includes 5.1 million Medibank customers, 2.8 million ahm customers and 1.8 million international customers. If you are a current or former customer of Medibank you\u2019ve likely already received an email advising you about the hack itself. Medibank has also sent follow-up emails to customers whose data was included in a sample of records received from the hacker. Late in October, the company said the hacker had access to all customer accounts, but could not say how many people actually had their data taken. Medibank has also said former customers have been included in the records received so far, as the company is legally required to keep information for seven years after a person stops being a Medibank customer. What personal information has been compromised? Medibank has determined the hacker was able to obtain the following information for all customers, including Medibank, ahm and international student customers:  Name Address Date of birth Gender Email address Medicare card number (in some cases) Health claims made with Medibank (in some cases)  Of these, the date of birth, address, Medicare card numbers and health claims would be of most concern for potential identity theft or extortion attempts. The health insurer said the hackers obtained claims for about 160,000 Medibank customers, 300,000 ahm customers and 20,000 international customers. The exposed information included service provider names and codes associated with diagnosis and procedures. What can I do about personal identification information being exposed? Similar to the response to the Optus data breach, experts suggest not rushing out and changing everything. People should always seek to use strong passwords and multifactor authentication on their online accounts \u2013 not just with Medibank.   Related: Medibank confirms hacker had access to data of all 3.9 million customers    They can also advise their bank and other financial institutions to put in place additional security checks for their accounts (particularly for over-the-phone transactions). For compromised Medicare numbers, Medibank has not yet advised how many or which customers are affected. What can I do about my personal medical information being breached? Unfortunately, at this stage, not a lot.  After Medibank refused to pay the ransom, the hackers began posting some of the records on a blog on the dark web. So far claims associated with alcohol and drug use, mental health, and terminating pregnancies have been released, along with hundreds of others. Medibank has said they have alerted those who have had their records posted on the dark web, and will be providing them direct support. What will Medibank do for affected customers? There will be a support package for affected customers, including:  Financial support for customers who \u201care in a uniquely vulnerable position\u201d as a result of the hack, who will be supported on an individual basis. Access to Medibank\u2019s health and wellbeing support line. Specialist ID protection services from IDCARE. Identity monitoring services for customers who have had their primary ID compromised. Reimbursement of fees for reissue of ID documents that were \u201cfully compromised\u201d in the hack.  Is the government doing anything? Federal government agencies including the Australian federal police are investigating the hack.  Commissioner Reece Kershaw announced that through the investigation the AFP had determined the hackers were located in Russia, and were believed to be associated with known hacker groups. The AFP has identified individuals involved, and Kershaw said the AFP would be seeking the support of Russian authorities to continue the investigation. The home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, has been in frequent contact with Medibank, and the National Coordination Mechanism was established to bring state and federal departments and agencies together on the breach along with Medicare. The mechanism has met eight times so far.

Earlier this month Medibank said it believed that only customers of its subsidiary ahm and those who were international students might have been affected by the hack of its systems. But now the company has said it has received files from the hackers that include main brand customers \u2013 widening the range of those potentially affected to 3.9 million. Medibank described the revelation as a \u201cdistressing development\u201d and apologised to customers. \u201cAs we continue to uncover the breadth and gravity of this crime, we recognise that these developments will be distressing for our customers, our people and the community \u2013 as it is to me,\u201d the Medibank CEO, David Koczkar, said.

In a statement to the ASX, the company said it had received a further series of files from the alleged hacker, who previously said they had obtained 200GB worth of data. Medibank found the files included the 100 ahm policy records received last week, which include personal and health claims data, plus another 1,000 policy records from ahm, and files which contain some Medibank, ahm and international student customer data. The records provided to the company last week included names, addresses, dates of birth, Medicare numbers, phone numbers and medical claims data, including information about diagnosis, procedures and location of medical services. Medibank said it is too soon to determine the full extent of the customer data that has been stolen and the total number of customers who were affected. A spokesperson for Medibank confirmed that former customers of the insurer are likely caught up in the hack, and have said state health record laws require the company to keep health information for seven years. Medibank has offered mental health and wellbeing support for customers, and access to specialist identity protection advice with IDCare. The company is also deferring premium increases for Medibank and ahm customers until 16 January 2023. Current and former customers will be contacted with advice on what to do, and those customers whose data has been confirmed to be compromised will be contacted separately. Guardian Australia reported on Monday that a view is forming within Medibank that the breach occurred through the theft of the credentials of a person with high-level access within the company, that was then sold on a Russian cybercriminal forum to another hacker. It is believed that hacker then installed two back doors into Medibank\u2019s systems using the credentials and installed specialised software to extract customer data.

The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac) said in a report on Tuesday that misconduct risks relating to the critical incident response team (Cirt) remained, despite previous investigations. The team of about 185 officers respond to high-risk incidents that are beyond the skills of general duties police but do not meet the criteria for the deployment of the elite special operations group. In the past five years, Cirt officers have been involved in the shooting of a man and a woman at a swingers party, the serious injury of man during a wrongful arrest at an LGBTQ+ bookshop, and driving a police car into a mentally ill man and kicking him in the head outside a hospital.

The Ibac report also reveals that three Cirt team members were involved in an incident when one of the officers threatened and intimidated the ex-partner of a relative. In response to the report, Victoria police said it was implementing a new use of force database, which it expected would be operational by next year.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Ibac found Cirt officers failed to properly record when they had used force, such as when none of the officers who drew their weapons or activated their Tasers during the bookshop raid recorded the actions on use of force forms, in breach of Victoria police policy. Ibac made six recommendations, half of which related to the database, including that Victoria police should inform it within six months on how the new system would improve the accuracy of such reports and be used to identify trends.Within a year, Ibac said Victoria police should report to it about how the database had overcome the risk of inaccurate or incomplete use of force reporting, and consult other police forces to identify barriers and risks to accurate reporting.   Related: Funding shortfalls force Melbourne legal centre to stop taking calls on police misconduct    Ibac also recommended that Victoria police strengthen Cirt\u2019s methods for assessing operational risk, clarify the roles and responsibilities of Cirt officers and general duties officers when the team attends incidents, and diversify Cirt\u2019s leadership and members, given more than 90% of its officers are men. \u201cCirt officers are responsible for responding to high-risk incidents, often involving people experiencing crisis,\u201d the report found. \u201cGiven the difficult nature of this work, it is important that Victoria police trains, equips, supervises and supports its officers appropriately. \u201cVictoria police must build on the work it has already done to further mitigate any risk of misconduct by Cirt.\u201d Jeremy King, a Robinson Gill lawyer who has represented several people who were injured in incidents involving Cirt, said that the report highlighted the need for an overhaul of the state\u2019s police oversight model. He said that he had recently reported Ibac to the Victorian Inspectorate after the watchdog failed to reinvestigate the bookshop raid, despite King telling them new evidence had come to light regarding the incident during a civil court case against the officers which resulted in a confidential settlement earlier this year. A Victoria Police spokesperson said the force was considering Ibac\u2019s recommendations. \u201cEach of the historic IBAC investigations mentioned in the report have been subject to previous recommendations which Victoria Police accepted. \u201cAs many in the community would be aware the Critical Incident Response Team operates in a complex environment that involves significant risk to the public, other police and CIRT members. \u201cVictoria Police has commenced work to procure a new use-of-force database which will improve accountability across Victoria Police and last year provided mandatory training for all frontline police about how and when use of force should be reported.\u201d", "Almost half of Australians support sending military to help defend Taiwan, poll suggests [2022-10-24T15:00:11Z]": "Almost half of Australians believe the country should send troops to help defend Taiwan against China if required, a much higher percentage of the population than in the US or Japan, a new survey suggests. About a third of the public in the US and Japan agreed with sending military forces to respond to such a crisis, according to polling commissioned by the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.

Opinion was evenly divided in the US too, where 33% agreed or strongly agreed with sending American troops to help defend Taiwan, while 31% disagreed or strongly disagreed.

The results reveal stronger support in all three countries for adopting the west\u2019s sanctions-heavy response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with 61% of the Australians polled agreeing with economically isolating China if it invaded Taiwan. More than half of Australians (53%) supported providing Taiwan with weapons. But a sizeable proportion of the respondents \u2013 38% \u2013 agreed Australia should not get involved at all. The former prime minister Paul Keating has argued that Taiwan was \u201cnot a vital Australian interest\u201d. The US Studies Centre also tested views on how Australia should respond if China built a military base in Solomon Islands, with the most popular option being to increase diplomacy in the Pacific region (81%), followed by offering Honiara a better economic deal than Beijing could provide (69%). About one-third of Australians polled agreed somewhat (19%) or strongly (15%) with the option of using military force against the base \u2013 the least popular option.

Israeli leaders have repeatedly said Jerusalem is the \u201ceternal, undivided\u201d capital of Israel. In 2017, then US president Donald Trump directed the state department to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as he \u201cdetermined that it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\u201d. The following year, in the final week of the Wentworth byelection campaign, Morrison declared that he was \u201copen-minded\u201d about following the US move and promised an Australian government review. At the time, Labor accused Morrison of playing \u201cgames with longstanding foreign policy positions five days out from a byelection\u201d. Australia\u2019s spy agency warned ministers that the proposed move may \u201cprovoke protest, unrest and possibly some violence in Gaza and the West Bank\u201d.   Related: Australia recognises West Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital but holds back on embassy move    Later the Australian government settled on a fallback policy that did not go as far as Trump. The December 2018 policy was to recognise West Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital but not to move the Australian embassy there until after a peace agreement. Morrison also acknowledged \u201cthe aspirations of the Palestinian people for a future state with its capital in East Jerusalem\u201d, while saying \u201cslavish adherence to the conventional wisdom over decades\u201d would only entrench \u201ca rancid stalemate\u201d. The head of the General Delegation of Palestine to Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, Izzat Abdulhadi, said it was his \u201cexpectation and hope\u201d that the new Labor government would change its policy in a number of areas. \u201cFrom our perspective, the issue of Jerusalem, East and West, is one of the final-status issues and should be resolved through negotiations and according to international law,\u201d he said. He said he hoped the new Australian government would proceed with \u201cimmediate recognition of the state of Palestine to adhere to ALP\u2019s 2018 and 2021 legally binding resolution of ALP national conferences\u201d. In both 2018 and 2021, Labor\u2019s national conference backed a resolution that \u201csupports the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure and recognised borders\u201d and \u201ccalls on the next Labor government to recognise Palestine as a state\u201d. However, those resolutions did not set a specific deadline, saying only that the party expected \u201cthat this issue will be an important priority for the next Labor government\u201d. In June, Australia did not sign up to a US-led statement about Israel and the Palestinian territories, instead raising deep concerns about \u201chuman rights abuses and the lack of progress towards a just and enduring two-state solution\u201d. Australia\u2019s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Amanda Gorely, agreed with the US argument that the UN human rights council brings \u201cdisproportionate scrutiny to Israel\u201d but she also indicated the Australian government would seek to take a balanced approach. \u201cAustralia\u2019s guiding principle will be advancing the cause for peace,\u201d Gorely said in June. \u201cViewing any conflict from one perspective will not achieve that goal.\u201d Despite the recent deletion of language about West Jerusalem and the Australian embassy, Dfat\u2019s Israel country brief still retains much of its original content. The old and new versions both say Australia is \u201cstrongly opposed to unfair targeting of Israel in the United Nations and other multilateral institutions\u201d. \u201cHowever, we make clear our concerns about Israeli actions that undermine the prospects of a two-state solution and continue to urge Israel and other actors to respect international law,\u201d both versions say.

He recently returned to the country, after serving as high commissioner to Ghana, and was disheartened by what he found. Andrews believes the state of the country\u2019s natural wildlife and biodiversity is the \u201cworst it\u2019s ever been\u201d and calls the ongoing destruction of forests and other habitat \u201ccrazy\u201d. After a political term marked by consecutive summer disasters and multiple official reports highlighting government failure, he sees it as a major issue. But, as far as the first two weeks of the election campaign are concerned, the environment may as well not exist. \u201cBiodiversity and nature have been completely absent from this campaign so far,\u201d he says. \u201cThat makes me really sad because Australians define ourselves through our wildlife. We\u2019ve got them on our money, our sports teams, our coat of arms, the tail of Qantas. We can\u2019t keep defining ourselves by our wildlife when we\u2019re losing it to extinction.\u201d Given so much of Australia\u2019s landscape had already been cleared, he believes the time has come for a conversation about sharing what remains with the country\u2019s unique, and increasingly struggling, wildlife. \u201cIf we\u2019re serious about what it means to be Australian \u2026 we are a rich enough country with enough habitat and enough cleared area to dedicate the remaining land to protection,\u201d he says. \u201cThe trouble is the Greens are the only party that says that, and it is seen as a fringe or extremist position.\u201d Andrews spent three years as threatened species commissioner. He says while he was proud of some of the things that were achieved under Hunt, he felt restricted due to climate denialism within the Coalition and the refusal to deal with habitat degradation.    He is not alone in raising concerns about the environment missing from the campaign. Others are also trying to raise its profile. A new report from a coalition of conservation groups says if Australia was serious about nature protection, it would increase its spending ten-fold. It highlights 100 animals and plants \u2013 including the orange-bellied parrot and the grassland earless dragon \u2013 that are at imminent risk of extinction.   Related: Koala listed as endangered after Australian governments fail to halt its decline    The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick this week called for a change in the way the environment is treated in the next parliament, including requiring the prime minister to make an annual extinction statement, listing the species newly declared as either extinct or critically endangered. The question is: is anyone listening? That Australia is not doing enough to protect its environment is well known. In the past term alone, three official reports, two from the Australian National Audit Office plus the independent review of Australia\u2019s environmental laws by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, highlighted a litany of environmental failures. A fourth, the five-yearly State of the Environment report, is also expected to highlight the ongoing decline. That report could have been tabled by the Morrison government before the campaign began but has been withheld. The rate of land-clearing in states such as Queensland and New South Wales has been increasing and the addition of new species to Australia\u2019s national list of threatened wildlife was accelerated by the country\u2019s worst bushfire disaster. The Australian Capital Territory\u2019s faunal emblem, the gang-gang cockatoo, entered the list as endangered, with the expert scientific committee highlighting the climate crisis as the major driver of reductions to populations of the bird. And a week before the election was called, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change again sounded the alarm that the world was rapidly running out of time to limit warming to 1.5C. That the climate and nature crises are intertwined is acknowledged globally. But the conversation about either of these issues in the campaign so far has been characterised by commentary on power bills, based on unsourced modelling, and a $220m pledge by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, for native forestry in Tasmania. Before the election was called, the Morrison government also promised $50m for a single species, the koala, which had its conservation status upgraded in February from vulnerable to endangered. Carol Booth, the principal policy analyst at the Invasive Species Council, says the silence from the major parties on what the next government will do to change the trajectory reveals a lot. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously making a judgment that it\u2019s not going to turn the election for them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey pay attention to individual crises, like the fires. But because it\u2019s a long term, insidious problem and there are so many threats coalescing and interacting \u2026 it\u2019s hard to get your head around. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see results in one term of government.\u201d   Related: Australian government \u2018aggravating extinction\u2019 through land-clearing approvals, analysis finds    The council \u2013 backed by BirdLife Australia, Bush Heritage, the Humane Society International and the Australian Land Conservation Alliance \u2013 has released a new report that notes extinctions are expected to dramatically escalate in Australia over the next two decades due to Australia\u2019s failure to deal with the major threats of invasive species, habitat destruction and climate change. It identifies 100 species that have a high risk of extinction in that time, including 20 freshwater fish, nine birds, eight frogs, six reptiles, one mammal and one butterfly with a greater than 50% risk of extinction within 20 years, and 55 plants at high risk of extinction within 10.    It argues an overhaul of Australia\u2019s threat abatement system is necessary after years of neglect, evidenced by overdue and outdated species recovery plans and the near decade-long failure by the Coalition to formally list major threats. That streak was finally broken this week after fire regimes that cause wildlife decline was officially listed as a key threat to Australia\u2019s environment, 14 years after it was first proposed. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, signed off on the decision shortly before the election was called. The Invasive Species Council\u2019s report puts forward solutions, including that governments simply apply the laws and protections they have neglected for so long. That is, systematically listing major threats and developing and implementing plans to tackle them as well as recover species. And it reiterates earlier work by a group of scientists led by the conservation ecologist Brendan Wintle that found Australia needed a ten-fold increase in nature spending to recover endangered wildlife. Booth says this would require expenditure of about $1.5bn to $2bn annually. \u201cThat\u2019s not much in terms of the whole budget but it\u2019s a lot more than they\u2019ve committed to date,\u201d she says. Samantha Vine, the head of conservation and science at BirdLife Australia, says most voters care about nature, but that passion is not always visible to politicians. She says when governments do make the effort to tackle threats, the trajectory of species facing extinction can be turned around. On Macquarie Island, for example, breeding populations of grey-headed albatross are recovering after governments prioritised the eradication of rodents and rabbits on the island. \u201cIt shows what can happen if you just invest in the work that needs to be done,\u201d she says. Guardian Australia asked the Coalition, Labor and the Greens about their priorities for nature. Much of the Morrison government\u2019s term has focused on its environmental deregulation agenda and a bid to transfer environmental approval powers to the states and territories. But Ley says it has also \u201cdelivered more than $6bn in environmental spending since 2019\u201d and points to budget announcements of $1bn for the Great Barrier Reef and $100m for the Environment Restoration Fund. As minister, she established a new 10-year threatened species strategy and delivered a long-awaited recovery plan for the koala. \u201cThe Morrison government is committed to practical action and to working with communities, land managers, traditional owners and scientists to protect the environment, from our heritage places to the health of our oceans and native species,\u201d she says. Labor\u2019s environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, says the party will have more to say about the environment closer to the election, but has already committed to increased funding for Indigenous rangers and Indigenous Protected Areas as well as $200m for urban rivers and catchments. She says the Australia State of the Environment Report, which Ley was sitting on, should be made public. \u201cProtecting and restoring the environment has never been more important after bushfires and floods,\u201d Butler says. \u201cThe environment cannot afford to have the Morrison-Joyce government mismanage [it] for another term.\u201d The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, says the party has been \u201cfighting against the Liberal-Nationals attacks on our environment since they came to power\u201d. \u201cOur environment is in crisis and the Greens are crucial to protecting it in the parliament,\u201d she says. She says the Greens have the most comprehensive policy of the parties for protecting the environment, which includes a zero extinction target and a commitment to end habitat destruction. This week Rex Patrick, who is fighting to keep his seat, said if reelected he would move for the prime minister to be \u201cpersonally accountable for Australia\u2019s irrevocable environmental failures\u201d. Patrick wants to create a requirement in Australia\u2019s environmental laws stating the prime minister must table an annual extinction and endangered species statement to parliament listing the species newly declared as either extinct or critically endangered. \u201cNo prime minister is going to be very keen to stand up in the parliament and sound the death knell for unique Australian species,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is what\u2019s likely to be required to focus the minds of governments to take action before the irrevocable point of extinction is reached.\u201d", "Sunshine in sight?

BoM models show that Pacific sea-surface temperatures will no longer meet La Ni\u00f1a thresholds by February. \u201cIt suggests \u2026 the event might peak a little bit earlier than the normal December\u2013January [period],\u201d McGregor said.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  During a La Ni\u00f1a, strong trade winds blow west across the Pacific Ocean. Warm surface water is pushed towards Asia and the seas north of Australia, resulting in higher rainfall than normal across the country\u2019s north-east. The weather event has the inverse effect across the Pacific, with 60% of the US declared to be in a designated drought zone last week. In an El Ni\u00f1o, the trade winds weaken or reverse, leading to warmer surface water in the central Pacific, and less moisture north of Australia. El Ni\u00f1o events are often associated with severe bushfire seasons, although the 2019-20 black summer bushfires occurred in a neutral year. Historically, around half of all years have been classified as ENSO-neutral, a phase that marks the transition between the La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. \u201cThere are typically two neutral years for every El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cQuite often an El Ni\u00f1o will transition [directly] into a La Ni\u00f1a, but La Ni\u00f1as don\u2019t typically transition straight into El Ni\u00f1o,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cLooking at the statistics of past events, it does suggest that we would more likely have a neutral event next year.\u201d Until the ENSO enters a neutral phase, \u201cwe\u2019ll still be expecting more rainfall than normal, unfortunately,\u201d he added. Extreme La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o events are projected to increase as the planet warms. Indian Ocean dipole to become neutral Another climate driver, the Indian Ocean dipole, is also forecast to swing into a neutral phase. The IOD has been negative for the past two years \u2013 the first time two consecutive such events have occurred since reliable records began in 1960. A negative IOD is usually associated with above-average spring rainfall for most of central and eastern Australia. An extreme positive IOD intensified the 2019-20 bushfires. \u201cModels indicate that the negative IOD is likely to persist into late spring before rapidly decaying,\u201d the BoM said. \u201cWhen La Ni\u00f1a and negative IOD conditions combine, the likelihood of above average rainfall over Australia is further increased, particularly for the eastern half of the continent.\u201d Australia\u2019s climate warmed by around 1.47C between 1910 and 2020.

It asked the privileges committee to investigate whether Thorpe\u2019s failure to disclose the relationship had obstructed, or improperly interfered with, the work of parliament\u2019s law enforcement committee \u2013 and whether she had committed any contempt of parliament. \nThorpe told the Senate she met Martin through \u201cblak activism\u201d and \u201cbriefly dated\u201d him in 2021, although the pair \u201cremain friends and have collaborated on [their] shared interests advocating rights of First Nations people\u201d. \n\u201cAll confidential information I received \u2026 was treated in confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cI strongly reject any suggestion that I would do anything other than comply with the committee\u2019s requirements.

But the bill, released in September, added the exceptional circumstances test, winning praise from Peter Dutton who said the government had got the balance right. Both Dutton and Dreyfus have not ruled out that the high bar for public hearings was added in response to negotiations with the government to pass the bill. At an inquiry hearing on Tuesday, the attorney general\u2019s department deputy secretary, Sarah Chidgey, denied the government had \u201cdeviated\u201d from that principle by adding the requirement of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. Haines asked: \u201cAt what point in the drafting was the exceptional circumstances test added to the test for public hearings?\u201d. Chidgey took the question on notice. She later told Shoebridge that Dreyfus \u201chad asked us about adding that as part of the threshold\u201d, but took on notice why the department had been asked to add it. In the letter Dreyfus wrote that responding to these questions \u201cwould, or might reasonably be expected to, disclose the deliberations of cabinet\u201d.

The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has highlighted the urgent but achievable actions needed to avoid catastrophic consequences of global heating, in what is in effect a final warning for governments on the climate. The report\u2019s release comes as residents of northern NSW continue to salvage homes and businesses in the wake of repeat floods.  \nThirty months is the very short time the world now has for global greenhouse gas emissions to finally start to fall or face the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The report from the IPCC says the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a \u201cnow or never\u201d dash to a low-carbon economy and society. But currently, the failure to make the changes needed will result in temperatures soaring past 3C. \u201cThe implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy,\u201d writes Frank Jotzo.

Cusack said Morrison had \u201ctrashed\u201d the party\u2019s values over two decades, as state director, \u201cthen as a scheming MP and now as prime minister finding loopholes in our constitution to delay preselections in order to get his way\u201d.

In an update to the Australian Stock Exchange on Wednesday, the company said that since Tuesday\u2019s announcement that all customer data may have been exposed, the investigation into the breach has now established the hacker had access to all Medibank, ahm and international student customers\u2019 personal data, and significant amounts of health claims data. The personal information includes name, address, date of birth, some Medicare card numbers and gender. The health information includes the claim codes made by customers. Medibank still cannot say definitively how many or which customers are affected beyond the 1,000 records provided to the insurer by the hacker in the past two weeks. It is through this communication with the hacker that Medibank has been able to determine the extent of the breach so far.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  The breach will also affect former customers, with Medibank confirming yesterday that state and territory health record laws require the company to keep data for seven years. Customers will be provided a hardship financial support package if they are in a \u201cuniquely vulnerable position\u201d as a result of the hack, and Medibank says it will reimburse customers for costs associated with the reissuing of ID documents for those that were compromised in the hack. The hack is likely to cost the company a minimum between $25m and $35m, Medibank said. This is due to Medibank not having cyber-attack insurance, and this estimated cost does not include customer compensation or regulatory or legal costs that may be brought against the company. Medibank is in communication with the hacker \u2013 who obtained stolen Medibank credentials from another hacker on a Russian cybercriminal forum \u2013 but the company has declined to say whether it would pay any ransom demands made. In a call with investors on Wednesday, Medibank\u2019s head of technology and operations, John Goodall, said that the company had deployed monitoring tools on its network and those tools suggest that the hacker is no longer in the company\u2019s systems.

Melanie Gibbons and Peter Sidgreaves, the MPs for Holsworthy and Camden, are each facing potential challengers from within the Liberal party ahead of the March poll, and could be set to join the growing list of government MPs heading for the exit doors. Gibbons faces an uphill battle in retaining her seat from former Liverpool deputy mayor Tina Ayyad, who Guardian Australia understands is determined to nominate despite pressure within the party to withdraw to head off an ugly internal battle. It would mark another blow for Dominic Perrottet\u2019s government ahead of the election, amid a swathe of resignations from senior ministers.   Related: Divisive MP David Elliott announces retirement from politics    The health and transport ministers, Brad Hazzard and David Elliott, this week said they plan to retire in March, bringing the number of current and former frontbenchers not contesting the election to eight. The list includes current ministers Rob Stokes, Victor Dominello and Geoff Lee, as well as former frontbenchers Melinda Pavey, Gabrielle Upton and Shelley Hancock. Between them, they have about 112 years of parliamentary experience. With the midterm departures of Gladys Berejiklian, John Barilaro and Andrew Constance and the retirement of speaker Johnathan O\u2019Dea and backbench MPs such as Stephen Bromhead, the government will have lost more than two centuries of experience.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  Gibbons \u2013 who announced last October that she planned to resign in order to run in the federal seat of Hughes, only to be blocked amid the factional machinations which saw preselections plagued by delays \u2013 is seen as a potential future minister. But Ayyad, the wife of the current Liverpool mayor, Ned Mannoun, is popular locally, and would benefit from a change in Holsworthy\u2019s boundaries that saw a reallocation of branches. Sidgreaves, a first-term MP, is likely to face at least one challenger: the former Camden mayor Lara Symkowiak. Sidgreaves sparked controversy in his own local branches in 2019 after he was the sole nominee for the seat to replace his factional ally, Chris Patterson. At the time Patterson did not announce his retirement until after nominations closed, and acted as a referee for Sidgreaves on his nomination form. It led to the president of the Camden Young Liberals, Aaron Colley, to complain of an \u201coutrageous bypassing of democracy\u201d. Factional manoeuvring is playing out in a series of preselections. In Pittwater, the families and communities minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, faces a difficult challenge to win preselection from moderate-backed Northern Beaches councillor Rory Amon. Maclaren-Jones, from the centre-right, declared she wanted to move from the upper house to fill the vacancy left by retiring infrastructure minister Rob Stokes. But senior party sources told the Guardian she faced an uphill battle to win the seat in an area dominated by the moderate faction. The party is desperate to avoid a saga similar to the buildup to the federal vote in May, which saw a series of preselections delayed due to factional infighting. But the so-called Warringah rules, championed by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, created a one-person-one-vote preselection system designed to increase local representation.   Related: Labor candidate overlooked for Kristina Keneally touted for NSW state seat    Those rules have meant sitting MPs such as Elliott have resigned rather than face the likelihood of losing a factional preselection challenge.

On Tuesday, the AFL apologised to players involved in the study and admitted they were \u201clet down\u201d. In March, a Guardian Australia investigation first revealed that findings from the multimillion-dollar study launched in 2014 never saw the light of day, despite the involvement of the world-renowned Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health and the AFL Players\u2019 Association.    Related: The AFL, the concussion doctor and the groundbreaking brain study that never appeared    The study, which promised to examine the long-term effects of concussion on players\u2019 brains, was driven by McCrory, the world-renowned neurologist and concussion expert who was chair of the international Concussion In Sport Group. In March, allegations emerged that McCrory plagiarised the work of other researchers, and he stood down from the CISG. By October, nine of McCrory\u2019s articles were retracted from prestigious medical journal the British Journal of Sports Medicine and 74 more had \u201cnotices of concern\u201d. The journal\u2019s editors said in a statement at the time that their trust in McCrory\u2019s work had been \u201cbroken\u201d. Following the plagiarism allegations and after the AFL was unable to answer dozens of questions from Guardian Australia about what became of the AFL\u2019s concussion research, including data from tests conducted on former players, the AFL announced that a comprehensive and independent review of McCrory\u2019s work for the league would be undertaken. The league had been unable to detail to Guardian Australia the evidence McCrory used to recommend concussion policies. McCrory has not responded to repeated requests from Guardian Australia for comment. The review, published on Tuesday, found the research project was \u201cunder-funded and under-resourced and suffered from a lack of governance, stewardship and coordination\u201d. \u201cThese problems manifested in there being no published research from the study which explained the results of the research imaging undertaken \u2026 and confusion on the part of the past player participants as to what tests or procedures related to clinical treatment as opposed to being purely for research purposes,\u201d the review said.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  The review found research participants were \u201centitled to expect that projects would be pursued through to completion, so that their voluntary contributions of time and effort were not wasted\u201d. It also said \u201cthe Florey Institute should ensure this project can be completed if that is possible and that participants are informed of the outcome, as appropriate\u201d. A spokesperson for the Florey said in a statement: \u201cWe have been concerned by the allegations of plagiarism and other issues raised with respect to Dr Paul McCrory. Our assessment of these matters is ongoing and remains confidential. \u201cWe will carefully review the 260-page [AFL] report in full before providing any response to its findings.\u201d The review panel made numerous recommendations to improve thethe AFL\u2019s new concussion management and research governance structure. In a statement, the AFL said it would immediately commence a process of consideration and response to all recommendations. The AFL\u2019s general counsel, Andrew Dillon, welcomed the report and apologised to players who gave up their time to participate in concussion research. \u201cThe AFL apologises to the past players who gave up their time in the hope of better understanding their own conditions and to assist with the research for the benefit of current and future players and were let down by the manner in which some of the research and clinical programs were at times conducted,\u201d Dillon said.

The research collaboration agreement was terminated in 2019 by the Florey Institute with no reasons given. In a memorandum of understanding between the AFL and Florey Institute, where McCrory had a laboratory, the AFL agreed to \u201cassist in sourcing funds and related support for the Research\u201d and \u201cuse reasonable endeavours to facilitate access to the players\u201d. The institute agreed to \u201cundertake the Research in a diligent and timely manner\u201d and \u201cprovide quarterly reports on the progress of the Research to the AFL\u201d or as requested. McCrory was involved in early discussions about a formal partnership between the AFL and Florey, and encouraged it, the review found. The review panel heard that AFL personnel requested more funding for concussion research from senior AFL management but that it was not provided. The review found that in early 2021, McCrory disagreed with the working draft of the proposed AFL and AFLW concussion guidelines and in particular the proposed return to play protocol, which he said \u201cdid not reflect the current and evolving science\u201d. In the course of the review, the Panel sought an explanation from McCrory as to the \u201ccurrent and evolving science\u201d that he was referring to in early 2021. In response, McCrory referred the panel to 57 academic articles. The panel found that the early 2021 proposed return to play protocol \u201cwas not inconsistent with the literature Associate Professor McCrory directed us to\u201d. Following McCrory\u2019s resignation from the AFL\u2019s scientific committee, the AFL and AFLW Concussion Guidelines adopted a minimum 12-day post-concussion rest and rehabilitation period after concussion. The review found McCrory was neither an employee nor contractor to the AFL, but an \u201cadvisor\u201d on an informal and mostly unpaid basis, though he was remunerated for providing neurology services to present and past players. The panel found \u201caspects of the relationship were problematic, in particularly the absence of clear reporting lines and protracted periods of no or delayed responses to correspondence\u201d by McCrory. The panel also said the informal arrangement\u201ccreated the potential for impropriety and detracted from the levels of accountability and transparency that could be expected of an entity of the AFL\u2019s size and public profile\u201d. The independent review panel was chaired by the senior lawyer Bernard Quinn KC. The review panel interviewed 19 witnesses including the former players John Platten, Allen Stoneham and Daniel Venables. The panel requested an interview with McCrory, but he declined.   Related: AFL concussion rules to be examined in Shane Tuck coroner\u2019s inquiry    Current and former AFL chief medical officers Michael Makdissi and Peter Harcourt were also interviewed as part of the review. A copy of the findings has been provided to the Victorian state coroner, who is conducting an investigation of the death of former Richmond footballer, Shane Tuck. Tuck took his own life in 2020 aged 38, and was later found to have had a severe case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma and history of concussion. Guardian Australia previously revealed that in May 2018 McCrory voluntarily provided an enforceable undertaking to the Medical Board of Australia and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency that he would not perform neurodiagnostic procedures, nerve conduction studies, or electromyography until approved to do so by the Board. That undertaking remains in effect. The AFL was unaware of the undertaking until informed about it by Guardian Australia. The review panel found that, given the limited scope of the undertaking, McCrory was not required to disclose the undertaking to the AFL. The panel also found the identified instances of plagiarism \u201c[did] not affect or taint the work that Associate Professor McCrory had undertaken for the AFL, in particular the AFL\u2019s guidelines on concussion, in large part because they do not involve the falsification or fabrication of relevant research\u201d.", "Bruce Lehrmann trial: jury to continue deliberating after saying it was unable to reach unanimous verdict [2022-10-25T05:00:21Z]": "Jurors in the Bruce Lehrmann trial have been urged to continue attempting to reach a verdict after signalling to the court they were \u201cunable\u201d to agree unanimously. The jury started deliberating last Wednesday on an allegation that Lehrmann raped colleague and fellow political staffer Brittany Higgins in Parliament House in the early hours of 23 March 2019. The ACT supreme court received a note on Tuesday afternoon indicating the jury was \u201cunable to reach a unanimous verdict\u201d. Chief justice Lucy McCallum directed the jury to make \u201ca further attempt to reach a verdict\u201d.   Related: Bruce Lehrmann trial: judge tells jury there is \u2018no rush\u2019 as deliberations continue    \u201cJudges are usually reluctant to discharge a jury because experience shows juries can in fact agree if given more time to consider the issues and evidence,\u201d McCallum said. McCallum asked the jury to go back to the jury room and try to again reach a unanimous verdict. She said their reasons for reaching the same verdict can differ and that it only matters that they all agree unanimously. \u201cI ask you to retire again to see whether you can reach a verdict in this trial,\u201d she said. Soon after they returned to the jury room, the jurors sent another note to the court indicating that they wanted to go home. McCallum accepted their request. \u201cHit the gym, walk the dog, do whatever need you need to do \u2026 get some respite from this arduous task,\u201d the judge said. Lehrmann has pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. He is accused of raping Higgins on a couch opposite the desk of then defence industry minister Linda Reynolds after a night of drinking at Canberra bars. Before they retired, the prosecution told the jury Higgins was an honest and genuine complainant whose story was consistent and unfaltering. The prosecutor, Shane Drumgold SC, said Lehrmann had given shifting versions for why he and Higgins went back to parliament, most of which were untrue. The defence, led by Steven Whybrow, pointed to inconsistencies in Higgins\u2019 evidence and said there was no other evidence, including DNA evidence, to independently corroborate her allegation. Whybrow alleged Higgins either did not know what happened that night or had fabricated an allegation after being found naked in parliament by security, prompting her to fear for her job.", "Victoria floods: nervous night in Shepparton but Goulburn River peaks lower than expected [2022-10-17T02:43:33Z]": "When Carol Adams went to bed on Sunday night at her home in Shepparton North, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would wake to flood waters breaching the sandbags lining her driveway. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to sleep until 4am,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go anywhere, where am I going to go?

[2022-10-16T16:30:40Z]": "The vast majority of Australia\u2019s future radioactive waste will be produced by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) Lucas Heights facility in Sydney, the latest figures show. For 40 years governments have pushed for a national radioactive waste storage facility, often claiming it is because currently waste is held at more than 100 sites across the country. But the latest statistics show almost all of it is in that one facility. A new inventory of Australia\u2019s radioactive waste, published in September by the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency, shows a larger than expected increase in waste in the future.   Related: Australia\u2019s nuclear waste is growing as battle over dump site heats up    Australia\u2019s waste is either low level (LLW), which is mainly from laboratories, or intermediate level (ILW), which is from nuclear medicine. ILW emits more radiation and requires more shielding. There are many variable factors, but the report notes that \u201cthe estimated volumes of Ansto\u2019s future LLW and ILW are substantially greater than previously reported\u201d. It estimates the levels of LLW in 100 years and ILW in 50 years. For LLW, that is a change in how future levels are measured. For ILW, it was a matter of having to revise existing estimates.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  \u201cFor LLW, the changes are mainly due to revised estimates of future waste generation rates (about 10% increase annually) and increased timeframes (100 years instead of 50 years waste volumes),\u201d the report notes. \u201cFor ILW, the main reason is that volume uncertainty is now included in the packaged volume estimate, where it had not been included previously.\u201d Ansto\u2019s waste is estimated to make up 12,972 cubic metres of the country\u2019s 13,287 cubic metres LLW (97.6%) in the next 100 years, and 3,753 cubic metres of the country\u2019s 3,887 cubic metres ILW (96.8%). Dave Sweeney, the nuclear free campaigner from the Australian Conservation Foundation, is opposed to the federal government\u2019s plan to move the country\u2019s waste to a single facility near Kimba in South Australia. He says it should stay where it (mostly) is. \u201cIt\u2019s Ansto\u2019s waste facility,\u201d he says. \u201cAnsto\u2019s 97% of intermediate and low level waste. It\u2019s not a national facility. It\u2019s Ansto\u2019s facility. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely striking.\u201d Sweeney says Ansto has the capacity to store the waste indefinitely, especially considering a recent $60m investment to expand its storage capacity. The local Aboriginal people, the Barngarla people, are also opposed to the site being on their traditional lands. The South Australian Greens senator Barbara Pocock says there is \u201cno pressing problem\u201d with waste storage, so they may as well leave it where it is. \u201cThey\u2019re better off leaving it safely,\u201d she says, \u201cwell protected, with all the right safeguards in place, than to pull it out and have a double-handling non-solution.\u201d   Related: Australian research finds cost-effective way to recycle solar panels    Pocock is also concerned about the transport of waste from Lucas Heights and other facilities to the planned South Australian site. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a proper discussion in the SA community on the views of the transport of nuclear waste through our communities,\u201d she says. An Ansto spokesperson says having a single facility is \u201cin line with international best practice\u201d, and moving the waste is in line with commitments given to the Lucas Heights community. \u201cThe vast majority of the radioactive waste we produce is directly associated with the production of nuclear medicine that every Australian, on average, will need during their lifetime,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cBecause of this, Ansto will always need to have facilities to properly treat, prepare and consolidate these wastes before they can go to a national radioactive waste management facility. But we are not the appropriate place for Australia\u2019s waste to be held.\u201d The spokesperson says a facility of the size needed would not fit on the Ansto campus, that existing storage will be at full capacity within a decade, and the new storage will be at capacity by 2038. \u201cUltimately Ansto must be in the business of medicine production and supporting research, not diverting more space, more personnel and more resources to long-term waste management,\u201d the spokesperson says.", "Lidia Thorpe quits Greens party to pursue black sovereignty [2023-02-06T02:15:16Z]": "Victorian senator Lidia Thorpe has announced she is quitting the Greens and will move to the crossbench. \nThorpe made the announcement at a press conference in Canberra on Monday afternoon, after it was initially reported by Guardian Australia. \n\u201cI have told Greens [leader] Adam Bandt and the Senate president that I am resigning from the Greens to sit on the Senate crossbench,\u201d Thorpe said. \n\u201cThis country has a strong grassroots black sovereign movement, full of staunch and committed warriors, and I want to represent that movement fully in this parliament. It has become clear to me that I can\u2019t do that from within the Greens. \n\u201cNow I will be able to speak freely on all issues from a sovereign perspective without being constrained by portfolios and agreed party positions. \n\u201cGreens MPs, members and supporters have told me they want to support the voice.

They are expected to announce their stance this week. \nBandt said he was \u201ctruly sad\u201d that Thorpe had quit. \n\u201cI said to Lidia that I felt she could continue to advocate for black sovereignty within the Greens,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously come to a different view.\u201d \nBandt revealed he had offered for Thorpe to remain the Greens\u2019 first nations spokesperson, proposing that he take responsibility for the voice while respecting her right to take a different position to the party on that issue. \nBandt said the Greens wanted \u201cprogress on all elements of the Uluru statement from the heart\u201d, but he would not \u201cpre-empt\u201d the party\u2019s final position on the voice referendum. \nAnthony Albanese, constitutional experts and the expert working group have said the voice will have no bearing on First Nations sovereignty. \nThorpe wrote to the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, with a 1 February deadline requesting further assurance, such as formal recognition that Indigenous sovereignty was never be ceded in the referendum bill. \nWhile the Albanese government is progressing all three elements of the Uluru statement from the heart, Labor regards the Greens\u2019 policy to pursue truth, treaty and voice in that order as a risk to the yes campaign in the referendum. \nIn October Labor set aside $5.8m to start work on setting up a Makarrata commission, which would \u201coversee processes for agreement making and truth telling\u201d. \nAlthough Bandt and Faruqi had previously backed Thorpe continuing as the First Nations spokesperson on the basis the voice is a small part of the portfolio, party room members privately questioned whether that was viable in the year of the referendum campaign. \nLast week the Greens held a two-day retreat in Mount Macedon to discuss their 2023 strategy. Despite reports that Thorpe would take part remotely, Guardian Australia understands the Victorian senator did not participate. \n \n  Related: Indigenous voice legislation to be introduced this parliamentary term if referendum succeeds, PM says  \n \nIn November Thorpe put her name to the establishment of an inquiry into Indigenous bodies pushed by some of the Coalition\u2019s most strident opponents of the voice, before being forced to withdraw by Bandt and party colleagues. \nThorpe blamed an \u201cadministrative error\u201d for her support for the motion, which is due to be voted on as early as Tuesday, after Monday\u2019s Senate business was delayed by condolence motions for former senator Jim Molan. \nThorpe entered the Senate in September 2020, filling the vacancy of former Greens leader Richard Di Natale.

Australia\u2019s commitment was previously restricted to non-lethal military equipment, but on Sunday, Morrison said the government would increase its financial support to Nato to fund the supply of weapons for Ukrainian forces. \u201cThe Australian government will continue to stand up for what is right when it comes to Ukraine,\u201d Morrison said after attending a peace vigil at St Andrew\u2019s church in Lidcombe. \u201cWe are already providing significant support in terms of nonlethal aid, and I\u2019ve just spoken with the defence minister and we\u2019ll be seeking to provide whatever support we can for lethal aid through our Nato partners, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said on Sunday his state \u201cstands ready to assist the commonwealth government to resettle Ukrainians in need\u201d. \u201cWe have a proud Ukrainian community here in Victoria and we would work alongside that community to welcome any Ukrainian families seeking either temporary shelter or a new home.\u201d Morrison said it was \u201cunhelpful\u201d to conflate what was occurring in Ukraine with China\u2019s ambitions in regards to Taiwan, saying they were \u201cvery different\u201d situations. Earlier, Labor\u2019s shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine should not embolden China as she called for the \u201cstrongest possible sanctions\u201d against Moscow by the Australian government. While declining to comment specifically on whether events in Europe increased the likelihood of China moving on Taiwan, Wong said no country should see Russia\u2019s invasion as \u201cany justification\u201d for challenging the status quo in the region. \u201cIt is the case that what is occurring is relevant to our region, is relevant to the whole world, where peace and security is threatened, it affects all of us everywhere,\u201d Wong told ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday. \u201cI would reiterate that no country should take any comfort from what is occurring, and unilateral aggressive changes to the status quo can never be justified. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get into hypotheticals [but] I simply say this: it is the principle of the region, of Taiwan, the United States and Australia that the status quo in relation to Taiwan can only be resolved peacefully, can only be altered peacefully and that there should be no unilateral changes to the status quo.\u201d   Related: How Ukrainian defiance has derailed Putin\u2019s plans    The defence minister, Peter Dutton, speculated last week that Beijing was \u201cprobably watching to see what the world reaction is so that they can make their own calculations down the track in relation to Taiwan\u201d. Russia and China have been drawing their alliance closer. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, accused China on Friday of offering Russia a \u201clifeline\u201d by easing trade relations in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, saying it was an \u201cinexplicable\u201d decision. Wong also criticised China for not using its position on the UN security council to condemn Russia\u2019s actions, saying it had shirked its responsibilities as a \u201cglobal leader\u201d. \u201cIt has a special responsibility to make a clear statement that defends the principles around the sovereignty, around territorial integrity, the principles of international law that are contained in the UN charter \u2013 it has not done so,\u201d Wong said. \u201cChina has, for decades, as a precept of their foreign policy that they respect sovereignty and territorial integrity. The position they are currently articulating in relation to Ukraine is inconsistent with China\u2019s stated foreign policy position over decades.\u201d The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said Russia\u2019s invasion came amid a changing global security environment that had also seen the increased assertiveness of China in Hong Kong and the South China Sea \u2013 and the return of a totalitarian Islamic regime in Afghanistan. \u201cThis is a great concern in terms of the far more unstable environment that the world faces, and a very clear reminder of the importance of investing in security and your defences, and in making sure that as nations, we stand together with those who share values and support of the international rules-based order, values in support of freedom and democracy, and that\u2019s certainly what our government has been doing and we\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d Birmingham told Sky News on Sunday. The senior minister said that there would be an increase to defence spending in next month\u2019s budget, saying it was a \u201cfundamental\u201d part of the government\u2019s plan that had underpinned the Aukus security pact with the UK and US. Offering what she said was the \u201cnational asset\u201d of bipartisan support for the government\u2019s response to the Ukraine crisis, Wong said Labor would support the Coalition\u2019s approach to sanctions, and if deemed necessary, would also back the suspension of two-way trade with Russia. \u201cWe will give bipartisan support to the most comprehensive and heaviest sanctions that Australia can and should take, so I extend that invitation to the government again,\u201d she said. Wong also committed Labor to a \u201cfloor\u201d on defence spending of 2%, saying strategic circumstances had changed since Labor was last in government. Acknowledging there were \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d for the government to make in regards to the expulsion of Russian diplomats, including the ambassador, Wong said Labor was \u201cnot looking to find difference\u201d with the government\u2019s approach. \u201cThat is something the government could consider,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that senator [Marise] Payne has said that the government has made a decision at this stage not to do so because they want to maintain the lines of communication, and I understand that. \u201cIf that is the case, I hope we are using that line of communication to continue to express our view about Russia\u2019s behaviour, that no historical narrative justifies what we are seeing, including, as you have said, the attacks on civilians.\u201d On Saturday, Queensland LNP senator James McGrath called for Australia to go further, saying weapons should be sent to Ukraine and the Russian ambassador expelled.

The Australian government has said it is providing cyber assistance and the provision of \u201cnon-lethal military equipment\u201d through Nato partners. Payne, the foreign affairs minister, said on Saturday that the option of expelling Russian diplomats \u201cremained a live option\u201d. \u201cIt is not something that we are considering currently.

Related: \u2018Actively develop friendship\u2019: China\u2019s new ambassador to Australia strikes softer tone    On Sunday, the Australian Greens said the government needed to strengthen sanctions against Russia by boycotting imports of crude oil from the country. According to a research paper from the federal parliamentary library, Australia imported about $86m worth of crude oil originating from Russia last financial year, about 1% of Australia\u2019s imports. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that while Australia\u2019s Russian oil imports were small, a boycott of Russian oil and gas \u201ccould start the ball rolling for the rest of the world\u201d. \u201cRussia is a petrostate and Putin\u2019s power comes from oil and gas \u2013 Australia should stop buying Russian oil and hit Putin where it hurts,\u201d Bandt said.", "Environmental policies are taking a back seat in the SA election. Should voters be worried? [2022-03-18T01:19:56Z]": "The last time South Australians went to the polls to vote in a new government, the state had become a battlefield in a bitter national debate on the climate crisis. A violent storm in 2016 had whipped up two tornadoes \u2013 unheard of in that part of the world \u2013 and sent them barrelling down the centre of the continent, ripping through transmission lines and plunging the state into darkness. In the aftermath South Australians became collateral damage in a national culture war over the climate crisis, renewable energy and how best to respond to an increasingly volatile environment. Federal politicians seized on the statewide blackout to claim renewable energy was unstable and unreliable, while billionaires Elon Musk and Mike Cannon-Brookes famously arranged a bet over social media about the direction of the state\u2019s power grid.   Related: South Australian election: can social media savvy Peter Malinauskas lead Labor back to power?    Against this backdrop, the need to transition to a zero carbon economy sparked fierce competition between the two major parties at the 2018 election \u2013 a sclerotic Labor administration that had been in power for 16 years and a Liberal opposition sensing blood. Four years later, as South Australians go back to the polling booth this Saturday, the major parties have been relatively quiet on the climate crisis and environmental issues. With the power grid stabilised and the proportion of the state\u2019s energy needs provided by renewables growing from zero to 60% in 14 years, it is no longer the contentious issue it once was. Residents of Kangaroo Island and the Adelaide Hills are yet to fully recover from the Black Summer Bushfires and headlines from the catastrophic floods in New South Wales and Queensland have dominated during the campaign, but the climate crisis has largely taken a back seat as debate focuses on a crisis in the health system.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning      Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Patrick O\u2019Connor, the president of the Nature Conservation Society, says this should be a concern to voters as the time available to act is shrinking, with scientists warning deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are needed by 2030. \u201cThe next government will finish its term halfway through that decade. Any government going into an election with nothing to say is very significant,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. \u201cSo far the Liberal government has had nothing to say. If I otherwise liked something about the Liberal Party agenda, what would I be voting for in the next four years on climate change and biodiversity? I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2018Business as usual\u2019 Even with bipartisan support for the transition to renewable energy and the state having a head start on other jurisdictions, South Australia is not without its problems. Emissions from power generation are falling, but according to the Department for Environment and Water those from road transport are growing fast. They are now the biggest source of emissions in the state. While this might be considered fertile ground for new policy proposals on freight, public transport, cycling and electric vehicles, the response from the incumbent Liberals has been \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d on environmental issues \u2013 consistent with the party\u2019s broader budget-conscious and austerity-minded campaign. On electric vehicles, for example, the Liberal government introduced an incentive scheme to encourage uptake that included a $3,000 subsidy program. These incentives were welcomed by industry, but they were not as generous as New South Wales\u2019 program, as they also introduced an EV user charge that discourages people from making a switch. The government is instead relying on its environmental record. It promises to continue work on the expansion of port infrastructure at Port Bonython on the Eyre Peninsula to facilitate hydrogen exports, as well as engaging in early talks to convert the Nyrstar lead refinery at Port Pirie to renewable energy and agricultural projects around carbon farming and lowering methane emissions.    Speaking to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, David Spiers, says the Liberal government\u2019s approach to the climate crisis had prioritised building the infrastructure needed for private industry to do the heavy lifting on the transition. \u201cWe will be continuing our trajectory around what I think is a really strong platform that we put in place with our climate action plan,\u201d Spiers says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a plan out there for the best part of the year. It will be business as usual but not in a way where there is low ambition. \u201c[We will be] transitioning our economy, getting everything in place, and focusing on two or three areas, agriculture, transportation, hydrogen and carbon and sequestration and storage.\u201d Sitting on their laurels? The refusal to expand on what the party would do if returned to government has environment groups in South Australia concerned.   Related: SA environment minister challenges Morrison government to \u2018fast-track\u2019 electric vehicle transition    In the lead up to the election, the South Australian Conservation Council \u2013 a coalition of groups with more than 100,000 members \u2013 issued a survey to both major parties, the Greens and SA Best.  The Liberal Party, however, refused to participate, responding instead with a statement highlighting past achievements. Spiers, known for colourful attacks on political opponents, says the party did not participate because he believed the survey was \u201cstacked against us\u201d and describes its organisers as \u201ca bit of a joke\u201d. The chief executive of the Conservation Council SA, Craig Wilkins, stands by the scorecard, its methodology and the responses which are published on its website. \u201cIt was a near identical process in 2018, when the Liberal Party was in opposition and eager to get our support. They were quite happy to follow through and provide comments at the time,\u201d Wilkins says. Wilkins says the creation of Australia\u2019s largest national park in the Munga-Thirri-Simpson desert was \u201cthe most important environmental outcome\u201d from the Marshall government during its term but \u201cno party can be allowed to coast and sit on their laurels\u201d. Going green quickly Against this backdrop the Labor opposition has sought to distinguish itself by putting a new $593m government-owned 200MW green hydrogen power plant at the centre of its election pitch. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Susan Close, says under current plans the project would be built near Whyalla to support nearby industrial operations, including the local steelworks, but could be opened up to later export clean energy. \u201cOur view is if we\u2019re going to continue to have manufacturing in Australia it\u2019s going to have to go green quickly. This is our contribution to that,\u201d Close says.    The proposal was dismissed by the Liberal Party, which says the cost of construction was likely to blow out to $1.2b, while Whyalla locals have raised concerns over whether it will interfere with the migration of giant cuttlefish in the Upper Spencer Gulf.  \u201cThere will be no trouble for the cuttlefish,\u201d Close said. \u201cWe would never do that.\u201d Environmental groups however have raised concerns after Labor announced on Wednesday it would fund its other election commitments by introducing an \u201cefficiency dividend\u201d of 1.7% across government departments in order to offset the cost of its election commitments. Health, education, police, child protection, Tafe, courts and emergency services would be exempted from the savings measure. Wilkins said $34m in \u201ccore funding\u201d had already been cut from the Department of Environment and Water over the last four years and the efficiency dividend could slash an additional $1.3m in funding.On other issues both Labor and the Greens say they would support a range of changes if in a position to decide policy after Saturday. They include an expansion of schemes to support solar and battery systems in low-income households, a world heritage application for the Great Australian Bight and the introduction of a state biodiversity act. A looming issue that will carry over, and is likely to remain vexed whatever the election result, is the construction of a federal nuclear waste dump at Kimba on the Eyre peninsula. Labor, the Greens and independents all oppose the dump. Wilkins says the federal government has just assumed \u201cthey\u2019ll just be able to roll it out and somehow South Australians will accept it and everyone will move on\u201d, but that may not the case, and the election could throw its future into doubt. \u201cThis facility is supposed to be there for nearly 100 years,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cThat raises big questions, I would have thought.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 March 2022. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Labor\u2019s efficiency dividend would cover health, education, police, child protection, Tafe, courts and emergency services. Those areas are exempt.

A new Covid wave had begun, and would peak in August, he said, adding that the government had responded to health advice and would ensure vulnerable people were looked after. \n \n  Related: \u2018Not just another wave\u2019: Australia\u2019s Covid hospitalisations reach record levels in several states  \n \n\u201cI want to make sure that people aren\u2019t left behind, that vulnerable people are looked after and that no one is faced with the unenviable choice of not being able to isolate properly without losing an income,\u201d he said. \nThe payment will be available from Wednesday until 30 September, with the costs covered 50-50 with the states. \n\u201cWe need these supports to be in place as long as they\u2019re necessary to support Australians doing the right thing,\u201d Khorshid said. \n\u201cThey supported the most vulnerable of our workers from being able to do the right thing, to keep off work for a full week after a positive diagnosis for Covid to help protect their co-workers and other people in a workplace from contracting the disease. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the support in place to do that, how can you expect people to could the right thing?\u201d \nKhorshid also welcomed the announcement that telehealth appointments will be available to people who may need access to antiviral drugs until the end of October, but said the move didn\u2019t go far enough. \nThe government announced in June that a range of telehealth services would no longer be provided. \n\u201cThe reality is that many Australians who don\u2019t have access to video calls do need to access their doctor, whether they be a specialist or a dental practitioner, by telehealth and as of 1 July, around 70 item numbers were cut from Medicare that allowed access to telehealth and none of those have been reinstated,\u201d Khorshid said. \nThe AMA president also said that if reintroducing mask mandates became necessary, such a move should be supported by state and territory leaders as well as the federal government, and that while other countries have shortened the Covid isolation period to five days, the evidence showed people were still infectious for up to seven days. \n \n \n  Antiviral treatments can reduce the worst symptoms of COVID and relieve pressure on our hospitals.
